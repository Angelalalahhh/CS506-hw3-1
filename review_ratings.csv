Oakwood Boston,Dr,Qatar,4 Reviews,October 26  2017,10,None,Good locationFamily friendly2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms and extra rollaway bed to put in hallway. Perfect for big family or 2 small related families.
Oakwood Boston,Anonymous,Switzerland,8 Reviews,October 17  2017,8.8,N/A,FABULOUS location (historic sites. aquarium. Quincy market. near 3 subway lines. drop back in between sites!). Oakwood staff very helpful with registration process. lots of space and comfort for our family.
Oakwood Boston,Robin,United States of America,4 Reviews,September 15  2017,6.3,The bed is miserably uncomfortable.  The shower curtain sticks to you while you shower and the grout in the bathroom needs to be cleaned or replaced,Property is in a great location. Central to everything you want to see. Having 2 bdrm was great
Oakwood Boston,Overseeas,Saudi Arabia,2 Reviews,July 27  2017,7.5,Carpet needs to be cleaner.,Two bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. Good space for sitting and dining. Availability of full kitchen. Washer and dryer. Near to harbor. Nearby restaurants and activities.
Oakwood Boston,Aj,Egypt,3 Reviews,July 2  2017,4.6,The house keeping is sooo expensive and they don't even put u toilet paper when it's finished  or anything just cleaning with 157.00 dollars per day!!! We had to wait for any guest to open the main door when we arrived with there key because the concierge wasn't on desk and we had to wait outside the property with kids and bags.,N/A
Oakwood Boston,Susan,Australia,14 Reviews,May 28  2017,10,There was no kettle and the fridge was really noisy. It was hard to see the controls on the washing machine.,Really good location in a beautiful building. The apartment was spacious and comfortable and very quiet. I can thoroughly recommend this property.
Oakwood Boston,Susan,United States of America,1 review,May 25  2017,9.6,Booking this property is confusing.  You receive a third party contract that lists different date than you actually book.  However. the Oakwood general help staff are excellent and are available 24/7 by phone.This property is not a hotel so people should not expect to have any cleaning services unless you pay for it which is quite expensive.  However. there is a vacuum  and broom in the room if needed. I will always use this property whenever we visit Boston.,The location is perfect.  We traveled with our son and his wife. and our adult daughter.  Two bedrooms and a pull out sleeper in the living room . ample closet space. hangers and linens.Having a full kitchen. dishwasher and W/D is wonderful.  This was two blocks from the wedding we attended at the Boston Aquarium and the pre-wedding events.
Oakwood Boston,Anonymous,Canada,1 review,May 24  2017,9.2,It seems oakwood has some learning to do related to overnight and very short stay guests as they are used to catering to a longer term guest. There was a number of miscommunications related to the room booking. deposits. cancellations policy. etc. We were given the wrong room initially upon arrival.,Excellent location and very suitable for our needs.
Oakwood Boston,Carol,Canada,2 Reviews,May 24  2017,7.5,They do not offer parking. which makes things difficult if you have someone with mobility issues. However there is a parking garage behind them that you can request a daily pass from which gives you in and out privileges. It is pricey but does allow you to have a rental car on hand.,It is located near the subway and very easy to get to the wharf for all kinds of activities. It three great Irish pubs within walking distance.
Oakwood Boston,Alfonso,Costa Rica,3 Reviews,April 21  2017,6.7,Appliances and houseware in the bathroom and kitchen could be upgraded and/or updated.Configuration of the TV in the room was not ok. and we never managed to fix it.We arrived at 10pm after a long trip and the concierge was out; there was a sign saying he/she was patrolling the building. with his/her mobile phone number if you needed to call; but we flew from outside the US (as probably many other guests) and we didn't have a phone to call him/her; so we had to wait in the lobby for 50 minutes until another guest checking in got in and called him; when he finally arrived he apologized and said that there were 11 floors and that it took him a lot of time to go through all of them. I find that excuse unacceptable. they should ask the concierge to do that round after all new guests have already checked in (he knew there were two apartments left. because we could see both labeled envelopes in his table).Guest service was not good before the arrival (we had a few unpleaseant situations. finally solved but more due to our insistence than to their own initiative. we had to call from abroad the day before our trip to get the answer to an email we had written asking how we would collect the keys to the apartment). and inexistent during the stay (no one even wrote us a message asking if everything was ok. mere courtesy you could expect. even more after the prevous inconveniences; I needed something and went downstairs to their office. they said "sorry. we cannot help you with that". which is ok if was something out of their hands. but they also could've been a little more helpful suggesting me to the best way to get it somewhere else).,The bed was comfortable.The location is very good.Water heating was quick and good.
Oakwood Boston,Aura,Romania,9 Reviews,April 12  2017,8.3,Since it's not a hotel. but an apartment building. they do not restock on toiletries or cleaning products (like detergent for the dishwasher). I can see how that makes sense for longer stays. but for our week-long trip it was a small inconvenience. because you can usually buy items like these only in bulk.,Great localtion and great value for money!
Oakwood Boston,Ana,Panama,2 Reviews,March 1  2017,8.8,The halls of the Aparthotel are not very elegant but that is not very important if you do not use the Hotel very much.,The OAKWOOD apartments are excellent. They have a good price per rental per week. are fully furnished and have full kitchen. laundry. sets of sheets. towels. and personal items. The apartments are conveniently located. giving you the ease of walking to almost all of Boston's major attractions such as the New England Aquarium. Downtown for shopping. close to Old Trolley and Metro stops. TD Garden to see the games Basketball and Quincy Market where there are many restaurants. Even close to where several metro lines join to be able to go to various Boston Universities. famous Breweries. Museums. etc. We loved its location.
Oakwood Boston,Tarana,Azerbaijan,6 Reviews,February 26  2017,8.8,Furniture is a bit outdated. stovetop should be fixed for even cooking.,Great location in downtown. clear check in and check out instructions. clean and spacious apartment. comfortable bed. almost all kitchenware for cooking. T station in 2 minutes walk. lot of dining places around. The nearest supermarket - Roche Brothers in 15 minutes walk. near Downtown Crossing T station. however few grocery stores are in close proximity to apartment.
Oakwood Boston,Danielle,United States of America,5 Reviews,December 10  2016,10,Can't think of anything.,I was in Boston visiting with my daughter who lives there.  This was my third visit this year and my first time staying at the Oakwood Boston.  My initial reaction upon seeing the apartment was Wow!  It is an excellent. professional. and clean condominium. located downtown near a large variety of restaurants and shops.  The apartment was very spacious and well appointed with a full kitchen. living room. washer and dryer.  More importantly. the apartment is soundproof; I couldn’t hear my neighbors. so slept very well!  The staff was very accommodating too with my early check-in.  I would definitely look to stay here again when planning my next visit.
Oakwood Boston,Family,United States of America,1 review,December 9  2016,9.6,They cleaned the rug in the hall when we were there. It smelled very toxic for a couple of days. Also the parking is very. very expensive. Wish they could get a deal somewhere.,The beds were very comfortable! It was great the kids had their own bathroom. It is in a great location.
Oakwood Boston,Trevor Travel,Bermuda,1 review,November 21  2016,8.3,Staff could have been a a little more helpful.The cost if you wanted someone clean the room and empty trash for a day seemed a little pricey.,The room had full amenities including all necessary pots and pans. large fridge. electric cooker. spacious.Location was perfect to walk to Faneuil hall. 60 seconds away and the "T" line even closer.
Oakwood Boston,DR.ABHAY SHAH,India,2 Reviews,September 23  2016,8.8,They messed up my booking dates both check in and check out. Luckily I reached during office hours to check in or else I would not have got the keys to the room.,Location

14 Gloucester St #2B by Lyon Apartments,Anonymous,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,October 31  2017,8.3,N/A,Comfortable &amp; well equipped. For the purposes of my trip the location was excellent.
14 Gloucester St #4A by Lyon Apartments,Arthur,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 26  2017,8.8,parking but I was told it would be difficult.,Like everyone else has remark the location was great.   I am 75 and the unit was on the 4th floor but Mario said it would be great and the unit was great except for a slow drain in bathroom sink not enough light because they were burned out or not working.   But the kitchen was wonderful and all appliances brand new and to me high end'   Great place for younger couple and close to many nice restaurants
14 Gloucester St #4A by Lyon Apartments,Willem,South Africa,1 review,November 1  2017,8.8,Thats a lot of stairs - I was OK. but may want to warn people; also. coffee pod machine didnt work well,wonderfully located

112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Anonymous,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,October 17  2017,5.4,it was cleanish but not spotless . large chest of drawers took up a lot of room in bedroom but you couldnt open the drawers one bedside light that didnt work between four of us and 2 bedside tables.communal stairs tired and kitchen and bathroom tired . Bed uncomfortable as you rolled into the middle due to uneven floor.Lounge was nice and comfy though and fridge stocked with drinks and snacks and lots of free toiletries fab location,great location
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Mary,United States of America,4 Reviews,September 2  2017,8.8,Beds were lopsided and you would roll towards the middle---also. was with 2 women in their 70s----VERY difficult to get the luggage up 4 flights of stairs with no elevator. it was 60+ stairs to get to our room...which made coming and going quiet a chore. Plus there is NO parking so we ended up just turing our car in 2 days early. Very small sink in bathroom. like VERY SMALL SINK,Location was great and the host was very nice and accommodating :) place was very clean and there were some snacks waiting for us which we really appreciated! Building was beautiful and area was very nice and clean!
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Gill,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,August 10  2017,9.6,It's a cool apartment in an old style building in historic Boston so no lift and fairly basic bathroom and kitchen. Suited us and our teenagers perfectly. There was nothing we didn't like.,Fantastic location right in the heart of Beacon Hill District. Great views across Boston roof tops. Lovely cafes. restaurants. shops close by. Stylish and minimalist inside. Extremely clean and comfortable. Mario extremely helpful and quick to respond to requests. Excellent value for money.
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Scots,United Kingdom,1 review,August 1  2017,7.9,Bathroom is a little small and could do with some attention. Stairs are steep and at an angle as it is an old building so if you struggle with steps or have small children it is not the place for you.,Apartment is spacious with a large sitting room and tv. In excellent location could easily walk to Boston Common and other sites. Has good internet access.
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Nrh,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,July 25  2017,9.2,N/A,The apartment is in a lovely character property close to so many shops and restaurants. Also super close to Boston Common. We really enjoyed our stay. The bed was really comfy and the towels were the softer than any 5star hotel I have ever stayed in.
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Jacqueline,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,July 10  2017,4.2,Where do I start - 4th floor no lift - 58 uneven steps hauling luggage.  Sounds crazy but apartment floors off level falling to the middle of the apartment.  We were a family of four much too small for four people. Even sitting on the loo you were lob sided. Bathroom tiny no fan. Kitchen tiny no space to cook. mat dirt rooms didn't look so small in photos. Sofa in living area not too clean.  Booking.com should remove this from the website.,This property was extremely poor.  We booked three properties through booking.com for our recent visit to USA and this was the only one that was disappointing definitely would not stay here again.  Cannot think of anything I liked except it was relatively cheap but would of preferred to have paid more for a better standard waste of money.
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Irene,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,June 10  2017,9.2,Earlier information I had emailed a week before but got no reply then had internet problems which meant I couldn't access into apartment took a couple of hrs and a fair few phone calls but eventually got in however apartment is up four levels with a very steep staircase with luggage so not for the faint hearted,Great location not far from main area of Boston which felt safe apartment was clean and had what you needed for a short stay
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,James,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,May 28  2017,8.8,When booking we did not realise the flat was on the 4th floor without an elevator so carrying luggage was difficult,The location and a large amount of space. The host was really responsive to any needs and Boston is a great city.
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Beth,Canada,2 Reviews,April 5  2017,9.6,Nothing could have been better but the bathroom sink is very tiny ; however. one doesn't spend much time there (unlike the living room which was lovely). Also. no elevator and one must navigate four flight so stairs. For someone with mobility issues or lots of heavy luggage. it could prove to be challenging. It was not a deterrent to us and we preferred being on the top floor with no sounds above us. Also. although the building was quite. it is a city so bring your own white noise and sleep soundly.,Beds and bedding were very comfortable. Towels were unworn and very absorbent. Coffee was supplied via Keurig including Starbucks. Lots of light.  Bedrooms were well separated from each other so not impacted by sounds from the other family members.
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,G,Spain,2 Reviews,March 13  2017,10,N/A,Super clean. fresh. comfy. quiet. We changed after to two other hotels. and the comfort was not comparable. I would especially note the comfort of the bed and fresh bed sheets that seemed to be quite new! All in all. full recommendation. The bathroom is small but gives all you need. and the rest of the flat it just great.
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Karen,United Kingdom,13 Reviews,January 22  2017,9.2,The kitchen had the basic number of plates . dishes and glasses (between 2 and 4) but if there had been a party of 4 staying it would have been a bit difficult.. It would have been helpful to have known in advance that it was up 4 flights of narrow stairs.,Location.  It was comfortable. clean and warm.  Thoughtful provision of snacks so there was something to eat when you arrived.
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Cassandre,United States of America,1 review,January 16  2017,9.6,The only thing I would specify is that they do require you to pay previous to arriving. I did email the owner to let him know booking.com said the opposite and he said he would get it resolved. :) also. just a heads up. the apartment is on top of a massive hill and on the top floor. no elevators. ğŸ˜‚ it's definitely a workout so be sure to bring your A game!,The owner left us snacks and plenty of toiletries. Any time we had a question. we emailed him and he responded within minutes with an answer. Best trip ever!
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Ann,Canada,4 Reviews,December 5  2016,9.0,There are a lot of steep stairs going up to the 4th floor and there was no hairdryer provided as was mentioned in the ad.,The location was excellent. Close to attractions could walk to great shopping and restaurants. Beds were very comfortable. Living area was spacious. There was lots of hot water for showers. Kitchen facilities came in handy for making breakfast and morning coffee.

Two Bedroom Boston Luxury Apartment,Sirgourney,United States of America,1 review,August 2  2017,10,N/A,The staff was very pleasant to work with and accommodating. prairie to our stay. My bridesmaids and I had a really nice time staying here and it was a very comfortable stay. It was a nice space to hang with them and enjoy the last few days of my single life before I got married! Those beds are amazing! It is a spacious apartment and it was a plus that there were cooking utensils and things provided if you got hungry. Thank God for the elevator! We didn't hear anyone else in the building so the noise level was excellent. The A/C was useful during the hot days. Overall our stay was grand. I only wish it was a little closer to the heart of the city but it is still rather close.
Two Bedroom Boston Luxury Apartment,Philip,United States of America,1 review,July 9  2017,10,N/A,Song was very easy to work with! The kitchen had everything we needed and the beds were amazing.

The Copley House,Manuel,Germany,44 Reviews,November 2  2017,5.8,- Had to call several days if housekeeping would come and when. - The studio is really small especially since there is not much storage room for luggage it is difficult.- Had to buy a pan for the chicken so that we could cook.,- Good location
The Copley House,Ben,United States of America,1 review,November 1  2017,10,No good parking. Don't bring a car.,It was so quaint. in a quiet location. and easy access to public transportation. Good views from windows and front. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.
The Copley House,Willard,United States of America,39 Reviews,October 30  2017,9.2,The modern inverter temperature controller was not user friendly and took a while to learn.  The system is great once you understand how to use it.,This has to be one of the best locations in Boston.  It's close to the Prudential Center. the Green Line to get to the Gardner and Museum of Fine Arts. and to North Station. it's in a quiet. lovely Back Bay residential area close to a green corridor.  The building and room had a European flavor.  Very homey with a bay window with a nice dining table for two. great kitchenette. and fireplace (no longer operating).  The bed was comfortable.  There's good storage space also with nice appointments.
The Copley House,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 30  2017,6.3,The room was super hot with no air flowing...even with the window open it made sleeping difficult...The room was also very small. The water pipes above the bed were so loud that it made it difficult to sleep.,The bed was super comfortable! It was nice to be able to walk to get meals just a short 5 minutes from our building.
The Copley House,Anonymous,United Kingdom,18 Reviews,October 29  2017,8.3,N/A,Helpful staff. A tastefully decorated room that at first seemed a little small. but in reality was well fitted out and was plenty big enough for our needs.
The Copley House,Gemma,United States of America,1 review,October 29  2017,3.3,This place is insanely expensive for what is basically a grotty. smelly old apartment. I paid nearly $700 to stay in a place for two nights you’d pay half the amount to stay in an air bnb twice as nice. Smelt like old people. Skannky mismatched old furniture from a year’s sale. bathroom was like something out of prison and the hairdryer blew up in my hand and gave me an electric shock. If I was paying 1/4 of the $ I’d have said it was ok. Don’t stay here!,Nothing!
The Copley House,Douglas,United States of America,1 review,October 28  2017,10,The pullout couch wasn't the most comfortable but hey. it's a pull out. We dragged the mattress to the floor and made a comfortable slumber party. Problem solved.,First and foremost. I must compliment the staff. They were beyond amazing! Friendly. wonderfully helpful and all around good people. I traveled from NYC with my husband and his siblings in from Brazil. The area looked like it had stepped out of a fairytale. The apartment was gorgeous. Prime location and could not have asked for a better place. We will be returning soon and 450% staying with them again. Great job guys and thank you for a fantastic stay!
The Copley House,Soul,United Kingdom,1 review,October 26  2017,8.8,I did not realise that you had supplied tea and coffee was so tired did not look in cupards went and bought it from shop just needs to be on display was a nice touch though,Room cosy every thing we needed good shower
The Copley House,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 25  2017,4.6,The room was filthy dirty!  Rug stained and looked as if had never been cleaned counters appeared to nefered be cleaned and I’m sure floor had not been sweated for god knows how long!!  Big black behind bathroom door and we don’t have black hair!  Extremely dated place!,Location was perfect
The Copley House,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 24  2017,7.1,Price was high- ?? due to Head of the Charles?Heat didn't work in the room. Not an issue after the first night because it was unseasonably warm outside,Location was great! (we are Northeastern alum so love that area)
The Copley House,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 24  2017,9.2,N/A,The property was clean and in a good central loacarion. It was cery close to the subway sntrabce so it was easy to get around. There were also lots of eating options close.
The Copley House,Dede,United States of America,1 review,October 24  2017,6.3,Duvet cover was upside down on the bed - the ties were at the top by the pillows instead of at the bottom of the bed. Shower curtain needed to be cleaned or replaced - there was a line of black mold at the bottom.,Relatively plain. but for the most part clean. and serviceable. Bed was comfortable.
The Copley House,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 23  2017,7.1,Having to walk up 3 flights of stairs with large luggage.,Very cute and clean.  A little difficult to get to our room on the 3rd floor. especially with large luggage.  That wasn't taken into consideration. so on that point. we weren't too happy.  Otherwise. it was very nice.  A bit small. but otherwise quite nice.
The Copley House,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,October 23  2017,4.6,See above,Clean shower and toilet. Pull out bed was the " second double bed" although we were not told this at time of booking.  The pull out was most uncomfortable.Location was good quite central
The Copley House,Margaret,United States of America,1 review,October 23  2017,7.1,Outdated. huge gross stain on the couch. Bathroom has a slight step so you trip every time you go in. Its like staying at your Grandmother house.,The neighborhood is in walking distance of everything. Its quiet and safe. The staff are super friendly and helpful.
The Copley House,Courtney,United States of America,1 review,October 23  2017,6.3,The room was the very bare minimum. The bathroom was extremely tiny. the room was only big enough for the bed. Almost no walking room. They did their best with the space but I would say it was not worth the money. You were really crammed in there. If it were less expensive I think it would be a fine spot.,The Copley House had very friendly staff and the location was amazing! It is walking distance to restaurants and night life.
The Copley House,Joy,United States of America,1 review,October 22  2017,8.8,No,Near Prudential center.  Fenway Paak ;)....walking distance to T. and grocery...booking problem was handled very professionally ...staff very helpful
The Copley House,1st-time,United States of America,1 review,October 21  2017,9.2,The only thing that we didn't like was that the guests directly upstairs from us had small children who ran and stomped constantly. making it sound like there was a herd of buffalo above us beginning before 6:00 in the morning and ending after 10:00pm. Hotel Management was sympathetic and said they would talk to the guests. but obviously they are not able to account for the behavior of either the children or the parents.,The hotel was located conveniently for everything that we needed/wanted to do. The staff was wonderful and checked us in early and quickly. The room was lovely and the bed was very comfortable.
The Copley House,Anonymous,China,2 Reviews,October 20  2017,6.3,Property has several buildings and the one where we stayed  was not the one indicated on the website. The staircase is really difficult if you have big suitcases.,Good location and quite clean.
The Copley House,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 20  2017,9.2,Checkout was awkward.   The front desk isn't manned until 9:00 so I had to make a round trip from the convention center at mid-morning to exit the room and check my luggage.,The room had a fully equipped kitchenette. and it's an easy walk to the Hynes Convention Center.
The Copley House,Sharon,Australia,7 Reviews,October 20  2017,8.8,Not a lot. We did have to ask for a bottle opener. other than that all the basics were there.,My husband and I recently stayed for two nights at Copley House.  We found the check in staff extremely pleasant and indeed two of them helped us with our bags to our room which was located a short distance from the Reception area.  We had a spacious room with bed. table and chairs. sofa and a small kitchenette where we were able to prepare meals and separate bathroom.The location was really good with a short walk through a delightful park to Copley Square.I would definitely choose Copley House again when returning to Boston.
The Copley House,Neil,United Kingdom,12 Reviews,October 19  2017,9.2,I took a room without a bathroom. running water. With hindsight. I'd pay a bit more and have a bathroom.,Great location. Very helpful staff. Room's were clean. airy and comfortable. I'd use this property again.
The Copley House,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 19  2017,5.8,Property is somewhat tired and in need of refurbishment.  Tiny bathroom.  Very spotty Internet/WiFi made it un-usable.,Great Back Bay location. convenient access.
The Copley House,Charles,United States of America,1 review,October 18  2017,4.6,Disappointing overall.  Bathroom way too small. Too expensive for what we received.Maids entered room without permission. Air-conditioning was ancient window unit that didn't work well at all.,Bed was comfortable.
The Copley House,Rosemary,United States of America,1 review,October 17  2017,6.3,Room given us was  too small for 2 people. No elevators. Narrow and steep stairs. Paid the same rate as our friends who stayed  in a much better and bigger room. Would stay there again  but would request a bigger room.,Location was close to attractions and pubic transportation.
The Copley House,Linda,Netherlands,5 Reviews,October 16  2017,9.2,The bathroom needs a renovation.,I stayed in a studio appartment. Small but cosy. The appartment was located on the top Floor of a brownstone building. The interieur felt somewhat dated. especially the bathroom. Everything worked fine though. It had a small kitchen.
The Copley House,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 16  2017,6.3,More like a bed and breakfast but without the breakfast. Our room was an old studio apartment in a separate building. No amenities other than $25 parking. Had to walk up 4-floors.,Convenient location to walking downtown.
The Copley House,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 16  2017,8.8,Loud music from room next door. we had to bang on the door in the middle of the night. Smoke detector went off at 11 pm for no reason.,The bed was lovely. room cute. location awesome and very clean.
The Copley House,Zheng,China,22 Reviews,October 16  2017,7.5,I booked three nights for stay. The first night we were arranged to a room in the basement. The second day. I asked to switch room. the staff agreed. but offered us a room which was just redecorated with no one lived before. The room is terribly smelly. Finally. we were moved to a room on the 4th floor. but fortunately everything is fine. I want to highlight the staff who took our luggages upstairs is very helpful.,Location is good and the neighborhood is nice. Room is spacious and bed is big enough for three persons.
The Copley House,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 16  2017,7.9,As I mentioned above. the lighting was "lacking.",The location was excellent! We were within walking distance of the spot where our tours began every day.We liked the feel and appearance of the neighborhood. Overall. our Copley House stay was pleasant and convenient. Lighting wasn't good.
The Copley House,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 15  2017,8.8,Since it is not a new building you can hear people walking in the above  room.,Great location . able to walk to a lot of places and nice restaurants around.Clean room . comfortable bed.
The Copley House,Anonymous,United Kingdom,86 Reviews,October 15  2017,8.8,The room was a bit smaller than I was expecting.  Boston is expensive so the room size was ok.  Local 711 store is not well stocked so if you want any supplied best bring them with you.,A good base for Boston conference hotels.  I bit noisy but hey its like any other big city.Nice shower. fridge etc.  tea/coffee provided
The Copley House,Stephen,Australia,7 Reviews,October 15  2017,9.2,Only being fairly picky! Difficult to find tv channels on the TV- a printed guide to channels would have helped. A pair of tongs in the kitchen would be good.,Location excellent. ambience of the studio apartment. quiet neighbourhood that was genuinely full of locals. Excellent supermarket very close. and a laundromat not far away. Overall the best place we have stayed in while on our holiday. (This is out of five locations so far.)
The Copley House,Randy,Netherlands,29 Reviews,October 15  2017,6.7,Surroundings can be noisy. F.e. you ll hear your neighbours walk in their rooms and flush the toilet.,Very comvenient location. Within minutes from restaurants. shops and more.
The Copley House,Jane,Canada,3 Reviews,October 13  2017,5.0,The staircase to our room was grubby.  The room was very small with only a double bed jammed against one wall which is not what we were expecting from the picture of the budget studio. (Which cost us $311 after tax and parking. so not exactly budget prices!)  The air conditioning did not work and was not fixed when we mentioned that on our way out to dinner.  When we arrived back at 11 PM and complained they did bring up a fan. However it took an hour to cool the room down. Between that and the double bed for 2 adults not on their honeymoon not a good nights sleep!,The location was good. located close to lots of sites.  The staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful.  The front reception was clean and bright.  When we complained at check out they did graciously give us a 15% discount.
The Copley House,Damian,United Kingdom,10 Reviews,October 12  2017,4.2,N/A,We booked a one bed apartment.Got a one bed studio with fold down bed.The same size as a small hotel bedroom.Stair carpet was filthy.Not worth the money.
The Copley House,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 12  2017,5.4,The narrow steep stairs to get in and out of the room.  The hair on the floor of the bathroom when we walked in.  Limited parking.,The young lady at check in was wonderful.
The Copley House,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 12  2017,5.4,We reserved 2 rooms &amp; requested first floor rooms bc 1 person in each party r handicapped. We only got 1 on the 1st floor. My husband had 2 walk up stairs after recently having foot surgery. Office person was not willing to accommodate us after I had called &amp; the office confirmed 2 1st floor rooms in different buildings.,N/A

The Copley House,Michael,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 11  2017,10,There was nothing to dislike.,Really great location. easy walking into old Boston. kitchenette so we could get our own breakfasts. 7/11 just down the street. All you could want.
The Copley House,Connie,United States of America,1 review,October 10  2017,8.3,My room could have been a bigger.,I really enjoyed Copley House. It is a collection of brownstone/brick houses that have been made into comfortable apartments and efficiencies. I like having a kitchenette. The bathroom was very nice. brand new. spotless. It is not luxurious like a hotel room. and at nearly $300 a night including tax on a holiday weekend is not a super bargain. But I would definitely stay there again. I like the location. the style. the comfort. the place! It was just a 10-minute walk from Copley Square. great neighborhood restaurants. the T. Huntington Avenue in Back Bay. and several attractions. Would recommend.
The Copley House,Susan,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 9  2017,8.8,Had to go down 2 flights into basement. No windows in front of apartment but window and door out to back parking lot,Great location. Nicely laid out well stocked studio apt. So close to Backbay station and all transportation. Easily accomadated 3 of us. 4 would have been fine too. Convenient onsite parking
The Copley House,John,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 7  2017,9.2,Quite noisy when neighbouring rooms used their bathrooms. Not sure this can be helped though in such an old property.,Location was fantastic. as was the area. We were also lucky in being placed in The Copley House rather than one of the satellite properties.
The Copley House,Francesca,Italy,19 Reviews,October 6  2017,9.6,While the bed of the bedroom was excellent. the sofa was too thin and soft to be used for more than few nights. The bedroom was very tiny. without space to accomodate one large luggage; however. the sitting room was big enough even with the sofa bed kept open..,The location of the apartment was super: the neighborhood is very quite and safe. and the apartment was very close to the metro station at the Prudencial Center.All the apartment was generally clean and confortable.
The Copley House,Anonymous,United States of America,6 Reviews,October 4  2017,9.2,Sofa bed was a little squeaky and mattress was very thin. so you can feel the metal support bars. Also. no elevator. so you need to walk your luggage up to 2nd and 3rd floors.,Super convenient location. near subway and the shops at the Prudential. Friendly staff that helped explain local activities and transportation system. Room had a queen bed. sofa bed. dining table. good sized bathroom. and kitchenette. Nice. quiet neighborhood that feels very homey.
The Copley House,Linda,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,October 4  2017,5.4,Apartments need sound proofing. You can hear everything from other rooms ie. bathroom.

The Copley House,Daiva,Italy,6 Reviews,October 4  2017,4.2,Didn't like the stay at all . Showers didn't work . Parking was away from the property. Kitchenette facility so poor could not make a cup of tea,N/A
The Copley House,Ray,Australia,28 Reviews,October 3  2017,7.1,Rooms was very clean but there was some long black hair in the shower and bed areas. which definitely didn't come from me (bald. my wife blond). Minor problem.,The front desk staff were fantasitc and really helpful.especially Gabe. The location was excellent
The Copley House,Gordan,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 3  2017,10,Email communications never answered,Great upgrade to a better space.  Perfect location for Fenway Park and Downtown.  Not that hotel feel but more like home.
The Copley House,Zoe,United States of America,1 review,October 3  2017,10,I did not like walking with my luggage to different locations. I took Uber from the airport to "The Copley House" only to find out their main office location is different from its Google address. I had to walk two blocks to get to the right location. Once checked in. I had to walk to my accommodations two streets over. And finally. taking the stairs to the 3rd floor where my room was. So getting there was tougher than it should have been. but thankfully. I was able to leave the key in the room instead of walking back to the main office with my luggage for an early flight.,I got what I wanted. A great city location. I could walk alone and feel comfortable and safe. I didn't want to stay in another hotel. I love the homey feeling of the property.
The Copley House,Susan,United Kingdom,38 Reviews,October 2  2017,5.0,Very impersonal.I was in block across street from reception .Even reception didn't open till 11am.I had a single room that was very small as was the bathroom.,Location ok in back bay.

The Copley House,Anonymous,Australia,3 Reviews,October 2  2017,7.5,Room was a bit run down. things did not work (hair drier &amp; one hotplate). room was stuffy and air con unbearably noisy. They did get the window opened at my request. no worries. There were 2 of us. both with budget studios - one room ok. mine not. Value for $ by Boston standards.,Wonderful location &amp; staff were very nice.
The Copley House,Lyn,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 1  2017,9.2,N/A,Location. lovely quiet street but with a shop on the corner and 5mins walk to metro. Small basement apartment but bigger than standard hotel room and included small kitchen. table and 2 chairs. armchair and lots of storage. Staff really helpful and after a stressful drive into Boston we couldn't grasp directions to our parking space and so receptionist jumped in to show us-great service!
The Copley House,Joni,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 1  2017,8.8,It was very hard to find a parking spot to check in. but I guess this is normal for Boston. Our permanent parking location was a 10-15 min walk away down an alley behind some other buildings. again normal for that area. They will pick you up though and take you to and from your car. with or without luggage. so that is nice. And the walk was rather nice because the streets are beautiful.,Loved the room. queen bed. kitchenette with frig. large shower. the beautiful brick building and stoop. the location. air conditioning. staff was very nice even driving us to our parking spot.
The Copley House,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,October 1  2017,6.3,Could do with updating. There aren't many electric sockets and one was so old it couldn't hold the socket in. The kitchen area was dated. could do with a toaster. Only one comfy chair to sit on.,Comfortable bed. Great shower. Clean linen.
The Copley House,CarlPP,Australia,12 Reviews,September 30  2017,6.3,Cleanliness. Dirty cup and very dirty placemats on arrival. Only one element on cook top worked. Tried to use fry pan on the other one but set fire alarm off before even starting to cook as it was directly above the element on a lowered ceiling. Why provide cooking items if they can't be used? Too late when you've bought the food and then can't cook it. Rug on floor was very dirty. No bath mat provided on second day. Disappointing as it was not cheap.,Bed was comfortable. good sofa. Shower was excellent.
The Copley House,Tobias,United States of America,5 Reviews,September 29  2017,8.3,Needs a fresh coat of paint in areas and the front desk was not particularly helpful regarding parking.

The Copley House,Pamila,United States of America,4 Reviews,September 29  2017,9.2,N/A,Great location and comfortable accommodations. Nice to have a kitchen for preparing some meals. They have a coin op laundry facility for their guests to use and parking space. Very convenient.
The Copley House,Cathryn,United Kingdom,1 review,September 29  2017,7.5,N/A,Very good location- 45 minutes walk to the Ferries and Market Place. Copley house close to the Prudential centre with shopping and  Star Market for all your groceries. Lovely little park opposite to sit and while away the time. Room and bathroom good size with fast wifi. Staff very friendly and helpfully - booked us in early and changed our room on request.
The Copley House,nagyio,Hungary,17 Reviews,September 28  2017,9.6,Everything was fine. Two recommendations for improvement: (1) better noise-reduction at the door of the apartment and (2) a small dishwasher machine in the kitchenette.,The Hotel has several houses with various apartments in a residential district. The apartment we received was on Botolph Street. 1st floor: excellent lodging! The neighborhood is very nice and it is very close to Copley Square: a perfect place to visit Boston.  Several restaurants and cafes around. but with a fully equipped kitchen the apartment is good for self catering. (Shopping for food and beverages is very close.)We arrived in Boston by train: the "reception" and the apartment are 10-15 minutes easy walk from the Back Bay station - excellent location from this perspectives as well.The staff was very nice and friendly: the support and guidance we receive from Aura was first class.We would choose this place again!
The Copley House,Charles,United States of America,9 Reviews,September 28  2017,6.7,The room and bathroom were very small.  The hair dryer is attached to the wall in the bathroom with the toilet and the shower but there is no mirror.  It is almost impossible for a woman to blow dry her hair without a mirror.  I checked with the desk to try and get another hair dryer but they they do not have one.  The kitchen sink area has no kitchen towels and no place to hang one if there was a towel...jut a small towel and towel rack would make a difference.  A towel rack is also needed by the miniature sink in the bed area.,The location is good. the staff was nice and the room was clean.  The bed was good plus the air conditioning.
The Copley House,Clive,Australia,31 Reviews,September 27  2017,8.3,Room and bathroom a little small.,Location was excellent.  Short walk to restaurants. shops. hop on hop off. transport and supermarket.  Great to have a little kitchen chance to live in a brownstone terrace.
The Copley House,Gina,Canada,2 Reviews,September 27  2017,8.3,Shower water pressure was not good as a low flow shower head. Hot water was hit and miss but did warm up after awhile We left our room for the day most days by 11 but our room was only serviced once. We had to ask one of the staff cleaners if she would be cleaning it. She was super nice about it and said of course seemed surprised that we were missed. Maybe they only clean until a certain time each day. No recycling happening at the facility.,Location! Staff! Kitchenette! Water cooler lower level of Copley house available to fill up water bottles. Neighbourhood feeling. Original walk up Boston Brownstone. We did not like our first unit as underground lower suite asked to be moved and staff was able to accommodate us the next day. We had a superior studio. Not quite as pictures represent but definely fit us and the price was great for such a fantastic location.
The Copley House,Christopher,United Kingdom,1 review,September 25  2017,7.9,Not knowing exactly where we would be staying until we arrived.Being woken up at 2 am by people in the next room playing loud sex games - not sure what Copley House can do about sort of thing though!,Comfortable and well-equipped Everything necessary available in compact space. Staff could not have been more helpful. efficient and friendly
The Copley House,Roraima,United States of America,18 Reviews,September 24  2017,6.7,They don't provide daily cleaning service despide of the rate is not cheap. the overall look of the room is old/used  and the studio I got doesn't look like the picture.,The property is central located. very convenient. The neighborhood is very nice to walk. The bed was confortable.
The Copley House,Tricia,United Kingdom,29 Reviews,September 23  2017,7.9,Cover falling off heating element which was thick with dust. Not a prob for us as it was warm. Also be prepared for a walk to your room. We were offered help with bags. and said no problem as our room was going to be on first floor. Porter left. We then discovered we had to walk to another house in the rain a block and a half away. Copley has several houses all within the same area not necessarily the main one. Wasn't a problem but could be if weather bad or you need help that isn't available.,Reasonable size room and kitchenette which was well stocked with utensils etc. Needed a dish cloth to dry dishes. Comfy bed. Good shower. Great location close to hop on bus.subway.restaurants bars. Prudential centre and viewing tower. Amtrak. Nice old house in tree lined street. Helpful staff printed our trolley bus tickets.
The Copley House,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 23  2017,9.2,There are many steps to navigate for some rooms so when staying there keep that in mind.,The staff were friendly and very accommodating. An upgrade was available and provided at not cost to us.
The Copley House,Andrew,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,September 21  2017,9.2,Didn't like dog barking down the hall in one of the other apartments,Service was friendly and helpful including great advice on local restaurants and areas to explore. The room was small but adequate for my needs. Good powerful shower.
The Copley House,Elaine,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 20  2017,4.6,Booked this room 4 months ago in May. I've stayed here several times before. It's nothing special but I liked the idea of having a tiny kitchenette. This time will be the last time I stay there. I come to Boston regularly for oncology treatment at Dana Farber. First thing they asked me when I arrived was if I could manage the stairs to get to the 2nd floor. Yes. I said. I can manage those. Then they start telling me they have no parking available at any of the buildings where there was an available room.  The guy ex-pained to me they have 8 buildings and not enough parking. Is that my problem? Mind you. I made this reservation 4 months ago and they charged quite a bit extra for the parking!So we had to park behind another building and lug our bags up 2 flights of stairs just to get out to the street to walk to our residence. Those extra stairs were big problem for me. luckily I had my oxygen generator with me. The room. when we finally got there. had a flimsy outside door that I think (I hope!) was being repaired because it would be very easy to break in. Our room had a huge crack in the window. The bed is advertised as Queen but I wish I had a tape measure because I think it was full. not queen. There were no spare blankets and we were cold. Lastly. my Dana Farber appointment was at 9:45 am. My husband took the bags to the car and was going to drive back to get me. When he arrived at the car. a Copley House truck had pulled up tightly behind our car blocking us in. My husband had to call the front desk to get someone to move it. Yes. we were late for my appointment. Never staying here again. Awful place. awful service.,The room and bathroom were clean.
The Copley House,Katerina,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 19  2017,9.6,The bed is a little small for two people,I really loved staying at the Copley House. Everything was great and I would definitely stay there again. I traveled with a small dog and was very happy that there was no additional fee. Also there is a small dog park within 5 minutes walk from the hotel. The parking was only $25 and close to the room. The area is vey charming and close to all the sightseeings.
The Copley House,Simone,Austria,14 Reviews,September 19  2017,7.9,- left at 6 in the morning. had to bring down stuff without help as no 24 hours reception,- great location. walking distance to almost everything- staff at reception very helpful - we had a lot of luggage and they arranged for delivery to the room (third floor. no elevator)
The Copley House,Judy,United States of America,1 review,September 19  2017,10,It would have been good to have a broom and dustpan in the room. I broke a glass and didn't have anything to clean it up and the staff were off their shift. I left a note and it was well cleaned when I got back to my room,Comfortable bed and pillows. quiet. right in the middle of everything. Responsive staff. Great place. I will start there again
The Copley House,Dawn,United States of America,1 review,September 19  2017,8.3,I was surprised at how small my single 3rd floor walk up was. Still fit. just not any lounge space. Given the neighborhood. still a good choice.,I loved the location - nice tree lined quiet street close to everything! The staff was super helpful and friendly. The green belt/park in the block that runs thru that part of the city was the best transport ever.
The Copley House,Anonymous,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,September 18  2017,9.2,No cooking utensils. so had to stir food in the teflon frying pan with a spoon from the cutlery set - ouch!No tea towel in the kitchenSecondary glazing jammed open. so street noise entered the apartment. and a bulb also burnt out. These two points suggest Copley House could do better on maintenance checks between lettings,Very helpful receptionUseful local info and Boston map handed to us on check-inVery cleanLarge shower cubicleFabulous location on a quiet street but walking distance to everything

Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Pamela,United States of America,1 review,November 2  2017,10,Nothing to report. except i had indulged in the cost because I needed to be at the airport for an early flight.,The  room was gorgeous. bathroom clean and well stocked bed fabulous. view spectacular. crab cakes superlative. waiter a delightful  man.

Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Jill,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,November 1  2017,9.2,Thought our booking included breakfast; it didnâ€™t so stay cost more than we had anticipated. Not the hotelâ€™s fault though.,Receptionist changed our room on arrival for one with a fantastic view of the harbour.Water taxi was really convenient. Shuttle bus driver who picked us up from the airport was very informative and recommended subway pass which was good value for money.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Paul,United States of America,1 review,November 1  2017,9.2,Parking and food prices were really expensive,Amazing hotel.  Easily the best check in process I have ever had.  Amazing location.  Only issue was the cost.  Parking was $44 a day.  Food was expensive.  Still. I would go here in a heartbeat again.  Boston harbor and skyline with water taxi right outside the door on one side. Watching jets take off from Logan and Atlantic ocean on the other side.  Great spot for a business conference as you are right next to airport and can water taxi to city.  No car rental needed if flying into Boston.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Julie,Ireland,4 Reviews,November 1  2017,10,Nothing loved it all,The staff was amazing. the views were incredible of the Boston Bay.

Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,October 25  2017,6.3,0ver priced for small family room (basically as twin room with small double beds).  We were not told (nor was it only any of the correspondence) we had to book a courtesy bus from airport and therefore waited for ages late at night. Room service food was awful (although it was late so we were not charged).,Friendly staff. Close to airport.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Whiskysoup,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 25  2017,8.3,Very expensive. but I think this is more to do with land value in Boston than the Hotel. as it appeared reasonably priced compared to other hotels in the area.,Great service from staff. excellent Goldilocks bed (not too hard not too soft). Great location with views over the harbour to the city.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Tanya,United States of America,1 review,October 20  2017,8.8,didn't like paying $45 to park one night- just too much!  Hotel is expensive - wasn't business travel.,24 hr shuttle to airport was great (pretty much why I booked). Water taxi fun and convenient bonus (but didn't use. too tired). Room was very good. Helpful staff.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,Canada,3 Reviews,October 20  2017,7.5,My iphone was stolen in the dining room. so that too bad. I had to call the police and file a report. The staff was very defensive and rude to me.,Beautiful old building and great design.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,Canada,4 Reviews,October 19  2017,7.5,Self parking expensive ($44.00) Breakfast was not the greatest. Buffet area very awkward and buffet presentation uninviting. Food very mediocre. Plastic  shower curtain liner was "grungy" - unacceptable. it should have been changed long before.,Great view of Boston Harbor. Taking a water taxi across to the historical area. Friendly.  happy staff. Outdoor patio with gas fire pits was terrific for a cocktail or dinner.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,October 19  2017,6.7,The hotel trades on its location and harbour views. but is very expensive. as are many airport hotels.Despite booking months in advance. our room with a harbour view was not available on check-in. and the view was our main reason for choosing this hotel. The staff changed our room for the second night. The individual aircon units in each room are noisy and outdated.,Comfortable bed. harbour view when we eventually got one. Close to water taxis for crossing to Boston. Staff are all very pleasant and helpful.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 18  2017,9.6,Maid missed an empty beer bottle in the shower from previous guest. Did the maid not clean the shower?,Proximity to Logan Airport. Shuttle service was convenient.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Richard Marchetti,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 18  2017,6.7,Noise level form hallway outside the room was too high and we could hear the people in the rooms on both sides of us all night.  The window did not open which how I like sleep. No spear toliet paper in the bathroom. The shower was horrible with broken tiles and the water ran out and FILLED the bathroom floor. The price was a bit high even for Boston. Long term parking is just around the same price for the week at Logan,Being right next to the Airport and the view was great. Nice comfortable bar that pours a good drink
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Eric,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 18  2017,9.2,No complaints.,Beds were comfortable. Hotel is close to airport terminals.Staff helpful. shuttle bus driver was very helpful.View across Boston harbour from the restaurant was very pleasant while having dinner.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Showmetheroom,United States of America,23 Reviews,October 16  2017,6.3,Not convenient to the city of Boston without a car and at $48/day to park at the hotel and more in the city and with a confusing road system and heavy traffic not rational for leisure travel. For that reason I would not stay there again.,The room and the view.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 15  2017,9.2,We did not like that there was NOT a refrigerator and that you charged $3 for bottled water!!!  Restaurant was overpriced for dinner,The included breakfast buffet was nice.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 15  2017,7.5,The service at the restaurant starting the first morning was very slow. The second morning we didn't eat the as the wait was to long with a few open tables.  The lobster roll the first day was not that good. Couldn't taste the lobster at all.,The bed was very comfy.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,William,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,October 14  2017,8.8,Menus for dinner were not exciting but the chowder was excellent,Staff were very warm . attentive and efficient. Views over harbour were beautiful and proximity of harbour taxis a bonus.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Stacy,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 14  2017,10,The only negative (which really isn't anyone's fault) was that our toilet over flooded. however staff took care of the situation immediately and moved us to another room.,Everything was great. Staff were very attentive and friendly. Bed was heaven. the view was amazing. breakfast was yummy.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Primoz,Slovenia,17 Reviews,October 11  2017,8.8,Whenever there are two options of something - one included in your reservation and another you need to pay extra. the staff will always kindly offer you the second one. You have to be always on alert and inquire about everything or you will end up paying a lot more.Another thing I dislike about pricing scheme in the US overall is advertising the price without taxes. and only giving the price you will pay in the small print. I don't really care how much of my money goes to city tax. state tax etc. since there is no way I can avoid paying them anyway.,This may well be the hotel with the best view in Boston. Even though the planes are practically next to the hotel. you don't hear the noise. Clean and professional. Well connected with the free Boston Logan airport shuttle which stops practically in front of the hotel.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Lisa,Australia,10 Reviews,October 10  2017,7.9,Didn't process my breakfast order and then offered that I didn't have to pay but it was included in price anyway. No apologies,Convenience and comfort. Magnificent views.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 8  2017,9.6,Seating for breakfast seemed a little unorganized. charge for water in the room when you are paying $300 a night seemed ridiculous,Wish they were more clear as to what is included in breakfast when you purchase breakfast option
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Christopher,United States of America,1 review,October 1  2017,6.3,Blood on the sheets.  Moved us to another room. but connecting room door would not lock.  They sent up a support person who was able to close it with a wrench.  Offered only a breakfast to go in the morning for our trouble.  The breakfast they packed for us was inedible.  The bagels had cottage cheese on them. instead of cream cheese.Was a very poor experience.,Good location.  Picked us up from rental car location.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,Canada,2 Reviews,September 29  2017,9.2,Again. the in-house restaurant was a disaster.  Over-priced meals. poor service. slow service. and average food.  After eating here once we got outside food for breakfast and brought it back to the room.  On the last morning we ate breakfast at the airport.,The view and quietness from the room on the 15th floor.  The discount water taxi tickets were a pleasant surprise.  The short walk to the water taxi across Boston Harbour and the airport shuttle.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Marion,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,September 26  2017,8.3,From a bookings.com perspective Iâ€™d like to see total costs per night when reserving rather than the cost minus taxes. We were also told at check-in that breakfast was included however as it was a business package this was breakfast for one and we had to pay for the second breakfast.,We had a lovely waiter called Isa who couldnâ€™t do enoughAndrew in the bar was also very helpful and friendlyThe hotel has fabulous views across the harbour and although itâ€™s very close to the airport runways the soundproofing meant you hardly heard a thing.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,FJB68,United Kingdom,29 Reviews,September 22  2017,9.6,Only issue was there was only one bar with very limited seating which was also the only eating place - it's always nice to have a separate bar if you only want a drink. Very pedantic so don't let it put you off!,Amazing view of the city across the harbour. Good fitness suite. Great staff and food.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Elaine,United Kingdom,11 Reviews,September 18  2017,9.2,The restaurant was expensive with not much choice.,The location was excellent with views over the harbour of Boston. Excellent shuttle bus service from the hotel to airport/blue line (underground) straight into downtown Boston.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Dc,Portugal,5 Reviews,September 17  2017,9.6,The breakfast is quite expensive for what is offered. Unfortunately this a trend in hotels in North America.,The hotel location is a must for short stays arriving/departing from Logan. Water taxi and T Blue line Maverick station are a plus.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Nicole,Switzerland,2 Reviews,September 17  2017,7.9,TV didn`t work properly when we tried to rent a movie.  Technician came to fix it but it still didn`t work.  Air conditioning was loud.,Beautiful view. good restaurant. nice staff. quiet room
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Mary,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,September 16  2017,10,N/A,Lovely large rooms.complimentary Starbucks in the morning.regular shuttle to the terminals and a really great welcome from the front desk.Fantastic view of the Boston skyline. Will defiantly be our Logan hotel in the future.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Kevin,United States of America,1 review,September 14  2017,8.3,The maid service was hit and miss...a few times we came back to our room and there were old cereal bowls from breakfast still in our room. The majority of the staff were great and I would recommend this hotel.,A beautiful view of Boston Harbor and we loved the complimentary shuttle rides to and from the airport and subway each day during our stay.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Zachary,United States of America,36 Reviews,September 13  2017,9.2,N/A,--Excellent location. easy access to downtown via water taxis. very close to the airport--Airport shuttle makes getting to and from the airport easy
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,United States of America,11 Reviews,September 12  2017,8.8,Food and service at restaurant and breakfast roomservice food quality very disappointing....,Room and Bed very comfortable... Location and view with harborwalk path wonderful.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Guy,France,7 Reviews,September 12  2017,8.8,The back gound little noise from the air system on the roof.(This happens in all big hotels in usa but europeens are not accustom on those very low noise),The locationClose to the airportClose to the water taxi station (to take the ferry the next day)
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Michael,United States of America,1 review,September 11  2017,7.1,I had asked for a room looking at the water. I would have liked seeing a discount looking at the airport instead.,The staff was helpful and provided any information I asked. The food was good.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Mrs,Spain,63 Reviews,September 11  2017,7.1,Disappointing. quite old fashioned. very noisy air conditioning. No fridge in room and no ice machine on our floor. No coffee type shop where you could grab a coffee and croissant. full breakfast or nothing. Expensive for what it is. Hyatt Regency in Dubai is much nicer!,Good location for the airport and useful shuttle
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Gerda,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,September 11  2017,8.8,Was given an  interconnecting room and could hear chatting next door. Not too bad but a shame.,Lovely staff especially breakfast team and Elizabeth. View across water to Boston skyline. Very comfortable mattress. Good quick shuttle service.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Frederica,Canada,3 Reviews,September 9  2017,10,N/A,The location and the staff were phenomenal.  I will definitely return !  This hotel provided a great waterfront experience with a Coamipolitan city just a boat ride away.  Best of both worlds
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Nancy,United States of America,12 Reviews,September 4  2017,8.8,It would have been nice to have a second armchair in the room.,We loved the view from our room on the 9th floor even though it was the lesser view - it was of the runways and the bay alongside the airport. The view from the restaurant. and rooms on that side. is of downtown Boston. looking across the bay and really beautiful. especially at sunset. The evening we had dinner there the bay was full of boats of all kinds. from small sailboats and water taxis to huge barges and freighters. Dinner was wonderful - blackened salmon with truly excellent asparagus and bok choy at a table by the window. There is a very popular terrace just outside the dining room which must be booked in advance. And a lovely short walk along the bay.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Swissmiss,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 30  2017,9.2,The only thing we didn't care for was the state of the bathroom. It is clean but very small. we were three people and doubted we could have stayed very long without this frustrating us. There is no fan for fresh air. There was no towel rack. just one or two small hooks.  The bathroom needs a make-over for a high end hotel like this. but they won't be able to make it bigger.  Business people will be fine.,The perfect location to stay at when one wants to be near the airport.  The views of Boston from our room. the restaurant. and the outside property are utterly spectacular!  The staff was both friendly and professional and offered all kinds of help.  There is a water taxi right next door to take a fun trip across the water to Boston.  The airport shuttle and shuttle to the car rental were easy and super convenient. There is a long outside riverwalk for a leisurely stroll or a morning run.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Evans,Ireland,1 review,August 27  2017,7.9,the restaurant was a bit limited in choice. could have done with some better quality meal choices,shuttle to/from airport easy and driver very courteous. reception staff good.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Gary,United States of America,1 review,August 27  2017,8.8,Having to leave so earl in the morning to catch the plane. Our meal at the hotel was pricey.  $83.00 for a meal for two with no extras is more than we usually pay. No drinks or desert. the scallops were good but not that good.  I would look for a different place to eat. Didn't get to try the breakfast.,As we were flying out the next day we didn't get to enjoy the Hotel but like being close to the Airport. We would like to come back and enjoy the city and stay at Hyatt Regency.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Sheila,Switzerland,15 Reviews,August 26  2017,9.2,There wasn't a lot of seating at the lobby restaurant so clients had to wait in line to be seated. I think the lobby and lobby restaurant bar could use a bit of refreshing. Compared to the open views and general lightness of the rest of the hotel it seemed a bit rundown and dark.,Love the location on the water and along the airport. Immediate access to water taxi into Boston a great convenience.Large comfortable room with spectacular view of Boston skyline. Also great views of the busy runways with no accompanying noise!
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Orlene,United Arab Emirates,6 Reviews,August 19  2017,6.7,Very expensive.  We payed a little more than USD 450 per room (two double beds) and that didn't include breakfast or parking.  Parking was USD 44 per day; it should've been free considering the ample space all around the hotel. No restaurants nearby.,Although the hotel was located opposite the main town the hotel provided a free shuttle service to the nearest subway station. The views from the room were excellent. The food from their in-house grill restaurant was very good.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,France,1 review,August 15  2017,6.3,Bsthroom outdated tub. Bathroom. hairs on floor and in tub. Elevator all scratched up. Expensive. Coffee not good.,Room decor. room clean(except bathroom needs a redo). View from restaurant. Nice tv.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Jayadev,Bahrain,6 Reviews,August 13  2017,7.5,1.Breakfast buffet spread could improve. Had included breakfast in the room while booking. the same not communicated to the restaurant and had to specifically make a effort after the server brought the bill. No explanation of what was included in the buffet. the server on the day 2 told us the option and only then did we come to know. the day one we had to make do with what was on display which was really very basic.2. location far from downtown and not exactly good for tourists. more of a business hotel with good conference facilities.,The location was excellent  at the harbour side and friendly and helpful staff. Extremely close to the Boston Logan airport and complimentary hotel shuttles available to subway and airport. the water taxi to get to downtown was a great experience and gets you to the heart of the waterfront in 15 min. a bit expensive though at 12$ per head.Also sightseeing tours - old town trolley tours have a pickup so not much trouble to get to the tours.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Barry,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 8  2017,9.6,Parking spaces (see above).,Certainly one of the best views of the Boston skyline. Very convenient to airport. Rooms very clean and comfortable. Restaurant offers spectacular views and relaxed setting. Walking trails along the harbor are right outside the door. Parking lot spaces are too narrow. I know of two incidents. including my own. where one car was scraped by another going into or out of their parking space. The person who tapped our car was nice enough to admit it. another driver was not so fortunate.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Paul,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 7  2017,7.5,Sheets on the bed were either dirty or worn.Property felt like it cost about 33% more that it was worth.,Staff. particularly those in and around the restaurant. we very. very nice.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Hannah C.,United States of America,1 review,August 6  2017,9.6,N/A,Polite. helpful. and accommodating staff. Clean. bright room with beautiful views of Boston Harbor. The dining was also excellent. with great. healthy. and delicious choices. again with fantastic views of the harbor. Shuttle service to and from Logan was efficient and drivers were helpful and knowledgeable about the airport and hotel needs.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Carmen,United States of America,1 review,August 3  2017,10,Food took forever to get there when we order breakfast and dessert.  Food was kind of bland no salt.,Clean rooms and friendly staff.  Overall still good place to stay very convenient and close to water and city.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Casey,United States of America,1 review,August 2  2017,10,N/A,Wonderful harbor view !  I couldn't believe how beautiful it was being literally right next to the airport.  Lovely harbor walk with my husband and 18 mo during our last night of vacation.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Christine,United States of America,1 review,August 2  2017,9.6,Price for parking my rental was more that the actual cost of my rental for the day! The dinner food needs improvement Ceasar needs shaved parm and croutons.. Cod was dull...some pieces of the lobster in the lobster mac n cheese were old tasting ... not fresh and tender like it should be for your location.One of the bell hops said he would come up to get our luggage and never did... so we took it down ourselves in order to get to the shuttle to catch our plane...,The shower was heavenlyThe view was amazingThe beds were comfyShuttle to airport and trolley was great...very helpfulAJ (Manager of the Bell Station) = amazing!! I think that was his name...

Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Iyad,United Arab Emirates,19 Reviews,July 31  2017,8.3,Limited restaurant choices.,The views of the Boston Harbour were amazing! Location very convenient close to the airport. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. We got connected rooms which was great since we had our kids with us. Easy commute to the city in our rented vehicle. They gave us a discount on the parking fees since we stayed for 6 days at the hotel.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Pamela,United States of America,1 review,July 29  2017,8.8,Every thing except staff who were serving in the restaurant. They made us feel different. They didn't treat us well and I didn't want this to spoil my good days so Everyday I would catch a water taxi to take us to downtown and spend money there.,View and location perfect for any one looking for a getaway. stress reliever. fun and just everything good.I probably will be going back soon. It has been added to my list of the best places. I encourage everyone to visit this place and prove me wrongğŸ¤™ğŸ˜�
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,catherine davignon,United States of America,6 Reviews,July 29  2017,10,Nothing could have been better.  The person who checked us in lives about thirty minutes from us in NH&gt;,We were spending the night prior to putting family members on a flight to Japan.  We almost always stay here when we do that.  The view from the room is wonderful....oceanside.  We took the water taxi to the Sea Side Grille at the Hilton and it was fantastic.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Bonnie,United States of America,1 review,July 28  2017,10,That the City taxi company took us to the downtown Hyatt and left quickly. He was told several times what hotel but still took us to wrong one so we had to pay for another hotel.,N/A
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Clare,Australia,18 Reviews,July 27  2017,9.6,N/A,The staff were very helpful. We arrived early and stored our luggage. They phoned us when our room was available. about an hour before check in. We ate lunch and dinner at the restaurant. both meals were delicious! The shuttle to the airport was quick and the driver assisted us with our luggage.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Melissa,Canada,1 review,July 21  2017,6.7,Some of the staff on the evening shift. located outside minding the fire pit guests.One girl could not be bothered. when I asked to order a drink she forgot 3 times...and then when she would walk past me she literally looked the opposite direction to avoid eye contact.Then we sat on empty chairs outside to watch the sunset and were told to leave and ask inside. while another couple had done the same and was not told anything ! Incredibly bad service. I would solely not return because of this. especially after the cost of the room and the cost I WOULD HAVE paid if the waitresses were actually attentive. Ruined our sunset experience as we are newly engaged . Also - a waiter saw us with a case of beer in our hands heading back to our room (we are 30 years of age) and said "Come on man. atleast hide it. have a bit of decency" ....I didn't realize buying alcohol and bringing it back to our room was an issue ! Will definitely be telling others of our experience at this hotel and NOT returning.,Beautiful scenery from the hotel. located right next to the airport.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,James,United Kingdom,1 review,July 15  2017,10,N/A,Great value. can't fault the hotel. Amazing view even having booked late. The location is perfect as connected by water taxi to downtown. but away from the madness!
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Sheila,United States of America,1 review,July 14  2017,10,N/A,Giaseppe the shuttle driver was magnificent. He helped us catch a bus as he carried our heavy luggage and told us of the weather. We made a friend. Because of him when in Boston we will ALWAYS go back to our great Harbor Hyatt.  Please tell he and his boss THANKS. Sheila and David!!!
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Diane,United States of America,12 Reviews,July 12  2017,9.2,The shuttle to the airport was good. but the driver didn't know there was an international terminal.,The bed was wonderful. The food excellent but you should make a reservation at the restaurant.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Christopher,United States of America,1 review,July 9  2017,7.9,I chose not to park out rental vehicle at the hotel. but instead return it.  However parking would have been $40 per day...too expensive!,Great view of downtown Boston
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Kathryn,Australia,11 Reviews,July 8  2017,10,Absolutely nothing at all.,The view from the room across to the city of Boston at night especially was so stunning we did not close the curtains at all!
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Jamin,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 3  2017,9.6,The only issue I had with this place was the restaurant.  Food was just "ok. staff was unorganized and errors were frequent.  The wait to be sat was long as no tables were cleaned off yet.  The wait to order was long due to the wait staff being unorganized no communication.  ie 3 different waiters thought they were taking our table after 20mins of sitting there waiting.  Would 100% stay at this hotel again as it was great but would definitely eat out.,Hotel is great and clean.  Staff was super friendly and knowledgeable.  Views from the room was great overlooking the harbor into downtown Boston.  Overall. Great value for the money and nice experience.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Kara,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 25  2017,10,N/A,The view from our harbor view room was amazing especially at night. Even though it is close to the airport. the room was very quiet. The staff was very helpful. The shuttle was very convenient to take us to the airport as well as to the subway station. I very much recommend this hotel for your stay in Boston.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Cynthia,United States of America,4 Reviews,June 24  2017,10,N/A,The proximity to the airport was wonderful. Since our flight got in late at night. we went directly to the hotel and the shuttle service took me to the rental car center the next day to get our car. The view of the harbor both at night and at breakfast was great too. Delightful stay!
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,June 19  2017,4.6,The room seemed worn and not worth the high price. Our experience at the restaurant there was the worst we have ever had. The service was beyond terrible. We had to ask to be seated multiple times. and were completely ignored for over 30 minutes after we sat down. We finally flagged down a passing waiter and ordered drinks. Two for each of us because who knew when we'd see them again. Another person came much later to take food order. Food was actually pretty good when it arrived. but that is all that was good about the experience. We had to flag down yet another person to pay and finally get out of there. This restaurant needs staffing help. NOW. We felt trapped because there were no other restaurants within walking distance from this isolated hotel. We only ate at the hotel restaurant because the pizza place we tried to walk to was blocked off by a padlocked chain link fence! Will never stay at this hotel again.,location was good
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Sylwia,Poland,5 Reviews,June 14  2017,9.2,The price was quite high.,Staff was helpful and kind. My room was quiet and clean. There is a beautiful view on Boston financial district from the hotel lobby and restaurant. Overall. I was very satisfied.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Gail,United Kingdom,1 review,June 11  2017,5.4,Location was a bit isolated. you have to get a water taxi over  to Boston costing 12 dollars one way. a bit expensive for drinks glass of wine and a pint of beer at the hotel cost 20 dollars.,Room was very comfortable. views were fantastic.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Katharina,Switzerland,1 review,June 10  2017,7.9,A bit on the expensive side. while some equipment starts to be in less good shape (e.g. doorknob in bathroom. bathroom tiles).,Great location for arriving from across the Atlantic.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Daryl,United Kingdom,1 review,June 5  2017,9.6,As it seems to be the norm in the US these days the food and wine was very expensive,We had a complimentary upgrade to a harbour view which was sensational. Great subway links straight into Boston makes this the best hotel to be in!
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Viki,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 30  2017,7.9,The pict of the property is very miss leading at time of booking. I thought I was booking next to Science Museum. But  it was close to airport.It took for ever to get Hotel with Public transportation. Shuttle took long.,The view was amazing. Walking along the water during the morning and evening was so relaxing.We had a fire alarm at 2am . The staff deal very well with. Gave free Breakfast to guess. Restaurant excellent. Once you are in Hotel is paradise.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,James,United States of America,1 review,May 29  2017,5.8,I didn't like that when I booked the room the website said there was a pool and when we got there the front desk said there wasn't a pool?

Ramada Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,November 1  2017,5.8,The hotel was crowded and it was difficult to find a table at breakfast time.A map showing the shuttle pick-up points at the subway would have been very helpful,The bed was very comfortable and we were able to make coffee in our room in the morning.The shuttle drivers worked hard and did a great job.
Ramada Boston,Allison,United States of America,1 review,October 30  2017,6.3,The assistant manager was very rude on the phone and even in person and embarrassed me in front of other guest that were checking in pretty much calling me a lier. Then she said I was yelling in the lobby when I was talking to her and I wasn't yes my voice did get elevated but I wasn't yelling.  I was going to get a room next month with them for my boyfriend's birthday but never again.,The rooms were nice
Ramada Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 30  2017,8.3,N/A,the staff were very friendly. the only disappointment was we did'nt know about the free shuttle service from the airport to the hotel. if Booking.com could let us know and tell us were to wait for the shuttle bus then we would have been even happier. we did manage to find out at the airport. and the staff told us of the shuttle to JFK Subway  Station and the times it will take and pick up. overall very good service.
Ramada Boston,Rowena,Australia,34 Reviews,October 29  2017,6.3,You couldn't walk to anything and it was a bit far out if the centre. I didn't like that the breakfast was served on paper plates and plastic knives and forks and paper cups. Not only are these unpleasant to use it is bad for the environment. The over priced hotel for what it was.,The room was comfortable and clean. I liked that it had an iron and ironing board. And thankfully a shuttle bus to the subway.
Ramada Boston,Ak,India,2 Reviews,October 28  2017,6.3,Although some of the hotel staff were nice and delightful it was not all the time.

Ramada Boston,Charles,United States of America,1 review,October 26  2017,3.3,The management staff was very unfriendly.  We had issues with the plumbing in our room and was handed a PLUNGER!!!!  The management staff was not helpful with any questions regarding the city or sites.  No one smiled except for the cleaning staff.  We booked a reservation on the shuttle to get to the airport and it didn't even matter - they totally loaded up the shuttle and even went out of the way to the airport to drop one passenger off at a site not even on that route.  Luckily we were only there a short while and moved on.,Location.
Ramada Boston,Michael,Ireland,6 Reviews,October 26  2017,6.7,The area is a bit dangerous which i didnt research before i went. Saw the cops at the hotel several times over the course of 5 days. Plus the area where they bring you for the shuttle is a bit random i think. they should have dropped you off at South Station.,Friendly staff. clean and comfortable rooms. reasonable price and good selection of room service. Plus free breakfast.
Ramada Boston,M,Canada,1 review,October 25  2017,10,We liked that we could use our Visa Debit although we didn't find out until check-in that we have to hold the security deposit AND the total cost of the room on our Visa Debit. It posed a little problem but we got it fixed quickly and the staff was very patient.Because we went in the Fall there was no use of the pool as it was outside  (which is ok) &amp; there is no hot tub.,The rates were great and the location although outside of Boston was great because they have a hotel shuttle to the JFK/U Mass Subway Station! The staff were friendly and personable and helpful. Rooms were clean and were neatly arranged and designed. We also appreciated that our Visa Debit was a preferred form of payment as we DO NOT carry credit cards!We also liked that the Boston Bowl was right next door as we got into Boston area after 10:30 PM &amp; it was open to grab drinks and snacks. We didn't bowl this time. Thank you Ramada. I'm sure we will be back.
Ramada Boston,Kirsten,United States of America,4 Reviews,October 23  2017,5.8,The shuttle took 1 hour and ten minutes. They verbally told me it would be ten minutes.   It seems the hotel staff did know about the event. (marathon) but did not tell visitors  that it was  impossible to leave the parking lot.  If I would have known that. I would have rearranged my schedule instead of standing in the parking lot.  They did not know if there was a walkable route to the subway.  It seems they should know that answer.  The toilet leaked the whole night. and the bathroom sink faucet was difficult to turn on.  I felt like it was going to be pulled off and I would be charged for breaking it.  The staff treated me like I was in the way.  Not friendly or helpful.  They were on the phone. talking work. but still ignoring me.  The maintenance person was pleasant.,Location was a bit out of the city. which is a good thing. The room was clean.
Ramada Boston,Nancy,United States of America,1 review,October 23  2017,3.3,All that I wrote above. everyone stressed out &amp; unhappy.  Plus. I reserved a shuttle which we got to Lobby at 3:30 am for 4 am shuttle. No one was at desk. Someone came to desk at 3:45 am &amp; asked WHY we were there. When we said we requested a shuttle to the airport . he said he had no record of.  We had a long conversation with the worker the day before. she asked us what airline etc.  He managed to get us one fortunately. When we asked about restaurant . they said it was across the street in the bowling alley! So much for a relaxing quiet dinner.  The food was good when we found someone to wait on us.  We were the only ones in the restaurant!,Nothing. all was terrible. They were to pick us up by shuttle. instead I had to take an Uber as called 5 times. When I got there. they were " too busy" to answer phone. They had been swamped.  Then could find my reservation but not room I requested? It took forever but finally got us a room. Staff extremely stressed. unfriendly. Even when they had to get a manager to find me a room . she too was unfriendly. no eye contact. did not speak to us.
Ramada Boston,Jordan,United States of America,1 review,October 22  2017,2.9,The doors were hard to open. When you used your key they would sometimes open sometimes not and no deadbolt on the doors.,The breakfast was very nice plenty of a selection.
Ramada Boston,Sawandae,United States of America,1 review,October 20  2017,6.3,I didn’t like that my room was on the first floor when I specially asked for a high floor. that there were no windows in my room and during the night I smelled someone smoking when the hotel has a no smoking policy. Not to mention I didn’t get a bill at the end of my stay BC the printer wasn’t working. It was supposed to be emailed. but I never received it.,The staff was very friendly.
Ramada Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 20  2017,9.6,The pre-booked shuttle to the airport got held up in traffic. We were worried that we’d miss our flight home but the hotel called us a taxi!!,Great shuttle service. Great breakfast. Great service.
Ramada Boston,Gerry,Ireland,23 Reviews,October 19  2017,8.3,Having to get a taxi from the airport to the hotel because the shuttle was going to take over an hour to collect us.When I rang the day before I had gotten misleading information from the reception woman. It seems I could have indicated my arrival time. The traffic to and from the airport was very very busy. The shuttle to the airport on departure was very efficient and the driver was very nice.,Having the shuttle bus to bring us to and from the subway station and to the airport.
Ramada Boston,Karen,United States of America,1 review,October 18  2017,5.4,Loooong walk to the room.  Breakfast too early. closed by 10 AM.  Too expensive for what you get.  Carpets could be cleaner.,when we arrived the computers were down and it was late and very crowded.  the staff waited about a half hour and when the computers still didn't come on decided to check everyone in by hand.  bad situation. handled well.  Bed was comfortable. water nice and hot in shower.
Ramada Boston,Raquel,Spain,20 Reviews,October 17  2017,7.9,The noise of the air conditioners in the corridors. Far from the city centre but you can take the shuttle to go to the nearest metro station for free. I think the price it is a little bit high (but I don´t know if it´s normal for Boston or if there was a event in the city during our stay which could make the prices raise).,The staff was very helpful (shuttle drivers included). The free shuttle was great to pick you up to/from the subway. Room well equipped (hairdryer. fridge. coffee maker. iron...). The bowling alley just a step of the hotel. We did´t play but we enjoyed just watching others playing. amazing :)
Ramada Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,October 12  2017,3.3,THE HOTEL IS MILES OUT OF THE CITY AND FROM THE AIRPORT SO OVER PRICED WE COULD HAVE STAYED CLOSER TO THE CITY FOR LESS. THE HOTEL WAS TATTY. THE POOL WAS NOT AVAILABLE BUT LOOKED RUNDOWN. FRONT DESK SERVICE IS SLOW AND THE STAFF MADE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE AN INCONVENIENCE. BREAKFAST WAS OK.CONTINENTAL WITH EGGS.,NOT ALOT....THE SHOWER!!.... THE SHUTTLE IS USEFUL AND DANNY THE DRIVER IS A STAR AND THE ONLY HELPFUL MEMBER OF STAFF THERE.
Ramada Boston,Gayatri,United States of America,1 review,October 12  2017,2.5,The cleaning lady opened our room while we were in it. without knocking. When I asked the front desk. the receptionist said that yeah sometimes they start the cleaning early. before the guest checks out. The receptionist was not at all friendly and was rolling her eyes at every question we asked. Very unpleasant and unprofessional.,N/A
Ramada Boston,Barbara,United States of America,1 review,October 10  2017,9.2,The bathroom sink was very small.  There was no microwave in the room.  The refrigerator did not have a freezer.

Ramada Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 10  2017,4.6,Toilet seat too low and small. shower head not working properly. bath  towel rack too far from shower.  toilet paper dispenser located behind door. keycard not working properly (had to revalidate each time we entered room).  One front desk person did not have good customer service.,Comfy bed
Ramada Boston,Julie,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 9  2017,7.5,We came in on Amtrak - 13 hours. and the shuttle would not pick us up at South Station. We had to take the metro (Red Line) to JFK/UMass. Then we had to find the shuttle stop (having never been there before) - fyi: take the pedestrian bridge over the tracks. go down the steps or ramp. notice the Bank of America ATM kiosk. cross the access drive and wait on the island where the bus shelter is. the shuttle will pull into the access drive.They must have used queen sheets on a king mattress - the sheets barely reached to the edges of the mattress. We had to huddle in the middle to have enough sheet for both of us.The bathroom (tub and toilet) was one of the smallest I have ever been in - the floor was 30 by 60 inches. barely enough for the door to open without clipping the toilet (no room for your legs!). There was no night light in the bathroom - you'll have to either do it in the dark or turn on the full overhead light. It was raining when we stayed there. and there were several leaks in the hallways.,The king bed was very comfortable - firm but soft. The free breakfast was ample - eggs. etc. There's a good restaurant at the bowling alley next door (and a menu for it in each room!).
Ramada Boston,Anonymous,Australia,35 Reviews,October 9  2017,5.8,The toilet continued to leak and refill all the time/ quite annoying!  I was not impressed that they took an additional $100 US from our credit card for 3-4 days on hold without putting this on the receipt or informing us. I had to ask fir a receipt! Some staff were quite rude and lacked a professional approach. Dinner at associated restaurant was awful!,The room was comfortable and roomy enough. An adequate breakfast provided.
Ramada Boston,Luc,Canada,32 Reviews,October 8  2017,3.3,There are too many things that were just bad; I'll stick to the top 3. 1. Airport shuttle.  The website indicates free airport shuttle; to get it you need to call the hotel to send them the shuttle. No where on their booking.com page do they mention this nor on the ramada.com site.  We waited 3.5 hours at the airport.  2. Bad staff service.  When we finally got to the hotel we were greeted by an obnoxious manager who had no care in the world for courtesy or customer service.  3. The hallways smell like urine; the place is basically a slum.,The free shuttle to the subway.
Ramada Boston,Ryshum,United Kingdom,1 review,October 5  2017,5.4,The plastic plates &amp; plastic cutlery. Would've liked better choice of eggs.,The bed was very comfortable. staff &amp; reception were helpful. Plus point was the shuttle bus provided to take you to &amp; from the nearest train station. Coffee &amp; bread provided were good.
Ramada Boston,Pete,United Kingdom,16 Reviews,October 4  2017,7.9,N/A,A little way out of town so a very useful shuttle service to and from the airport and also to the nearest station at any time of day. Friendly and helpful staff .

Ramada Boston,Patty,United States of America,1 review,October 3  2017,6.3,Room was very small.  Shower head just a above my shoulders. Difficult to wash hair.  Asked for blanket at night.

Rain water makes lots of noise hitting aluminum surrounding pool area.,Location.
Ramada Boston,SH-toronto-Cda,Canada,17 Reviews,October 3  2017,5.0,We stayed for four nites...the room we were assigned was awful !!  It was in the back corner on the ground floor only a few rooms from a back exit (NOT overlooking the pool).  The first nite was okay and THEN.....we realized 2 rooms away was occupied by a drug addict (awful smell when walking by !) and she had two kids with her ! She often had her door open so she could watch her kids while standing in the exterior exit....smoking !  We had to walk by her room every time we left ours and we heard lots of noise thru the nite from the hall &amp; room.  Every day we advised the front desk/Belicia at least once of some concern (we were told the police were involved)....when we checked out. I was given only a $50 discount on 4 days cost ! (the clerk/Adrea said she would refer to the evening mgr who we spoke to daily to see if she felt that a bigger discount was appropriate - I have NOT been contacted)  I am very unhappy with the Ramada chain !!,The free shuttle van was great - every 1/2 hour to &amp; from the closest subway station (10-15 min depending on traffic).  The subway took 10 minutes to Boston Common.The breakfast was also great - number of tables. ground floor. selection. freshness. self serve toaster &amp; waffle makers.The (very clean) laundry room had 2 washers &amp; 2 dryers and was located near the front desk.
Ramada Boston,Ashlyn,United States of America,1 review,October 2  2017,2.5,Staff was rude. especially the consierge with poofy hair at the front desk. The rooms were not sound proof. Heard everything someone said as they walked by or decided to scream.,N/A

Ramada Boston,Paul,United Kingdom,31 Reviews,September 29  2017,6.7,Girl on Reception at arrival and departure should be taught to smile. She looked disinterested. A smile goes a long way.

Ramada Boston,Grove,United States of America,25 Reviews,September 18  2017,6.3,The only place to eat dinner for those w/o a car was a bowling alley. I realize that this isn't under the control of the motel. but a bowling alley just isn't a good place to have a relaxing meal. The breakfast was basic and would have been good enough except that the coffee was poor.,Room was basic but adequate for our needs. The pool looked inviting. although we didn't have time to use it.
Ramada Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,September 18  2017,5.0,This hotel is not in the best situation if you do not have transport. There is only a bowling alley with food option.

There was a window but it looked into the hall and this made for no privacy so the curtain was drawn shut the whole time.,The bed was nice and comfortable.

Ramada Boston,Paul,Ireland,3 Reviews,September 15  2017,5.8,Attitude &amp; behaviour of front line staff (reception &amp; courtesy shuttle bus drivers),Hotel itself was OK and decent value for money - location is not ideal as it is some distance from the nearest Metro station. the fact that a courtesy shuttle service operated between the hotel &amp; Metro is absolutely vital as the distance to the Metro makes walking not an option.  The attitude of reception staff &amp; shuttle drivers (apart from Omar) leaves a lot to be desired. Not customer friendly at all. the owners of this hotel (The Philips Family) need to urgently arrange for all front line staff to attend a basic course in customer service...remember. there are many instances in the hotel trade whereby moments of truth are used to form an opinion...unfortunately my observations of front line staff has left a sour taste and I would certainly never stay here again OR recommend to family or friends.
Ramada Boston,Cameron,United States of America,1 review,September 14  2017,6.3,There were a few hairs left in the tub. the deadbolt on the door didn't seem to work. there was no channel guide to my knowledge for the t.v.. There was also a menu provided for a 24 hour bowling alley/restaurant but failed to mention the restaurant closing at 11:30 p.m. so we had a hard time finding food at midnight. all of these are little things. The biggest issue was the courtesy shuttle. Perfect on the way to the train station but when calling for a ride back they failed to mention that instead of the normal 15 minutes it was going to be about an hour since it was after 11 and they had to go to the airport first. So my girlfriend and I sat on the curb outside of the Jfk T stop for 25 minutes before I called back learning it would be another 30 minutes. The operator didn't think it was pertant knowledge to let us know how long the wait was gonna be and didn't even try to offer an alternative like the number for a cab company. So we decided to download uber and were picked up in 2 minutes. Should have just started with uber in the first place.,The room was very close to the side entrance. Breakfast was nice except for the juice. Just tasted like water.

Ramada Boston,Paul,South Africa,24 Reviews,September 13  2017,8.8,There was a noisy crowd down the passage. although we understand that not much can be done. it would have been good if someone had tried to control them.Selling this a a beach venue is a bit of a joke.  The beach is hard to get to and dirty.,Although the property is not central and it takes 45 mins or so to get in and out of Boston. for its price we were very happy with the facilities.  We had a comfortable room with all you would expect in an average hotel with the added bonus of a swimming pool and an excellent breakfast (its a full breakfast with all the extras).The area is OK and there were restaurants nearby as well as supermarkets.  The beach is not easy to get to and is not great.The shuttle takes you to a station which will get you where you want to in Boston.  Recommend getting the day or week pass to avoid excessive travel expenses.
Ramada Boston,Anonymous,Canada,2 Reviews,September 11  2017,7.1,Having to call for the airport shuttle was kind of inconvenient. They should run every half hour so guests can anticipate rather than standing there for almost an hour waiting.,Clean room.easy access to subway. Bill the shuttle driver.

Hyatt Regency Boston,David,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,October 10  2017,5.8,Used Decaf pod. but was replaced with original coffee pod. Man brought up more pods but NOT decaf! Sent away to get some - didn't return. so rang yet again. Same man then appeared with decaf pods. He didn't seem to understand English just looking at us blankly. Housekeeping took away our dirty towels but left no clean ones in return. Complained to services manager about both issues. who said he'd sort out service for next day but didn't offer any refund for poor service. Not impressed!,N/A
Hyatt Regency Boston,Michael,Switzerland,19 Reviews,October 3  2017,6.7,No films channels on TV. as Hyatt sell films. 2 elevators needed to access street fro  rooms. Gym if a lomg walk and many stairs from all rooms,good location
Hyatt Regency Boston,Tomer,United States of America,17 Reviews,October 2  2017,9.6,- You need to take two different elevators to go from the building entrance to the rooms.- Water bottles are available in the room with a label attached that starts with the word "complimentary". but only if you read the entire thing (in a tiny font) you realize that they in fact cost $3.50. That's kind of deceptive...,Nice views and a sense that everything is new. Very good location.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,October 2  2017,7.9,We arrived to be told the hotel had overbooked our room.  We were downgraded for the night and then had to switch rooms the next day.  The daybed in the lounge was not made. there was no bed linen or towels (for both the downgraded room and the Suite we had originally booked) and we had to chase the hotel to get that organized.  The reception staff didnâ€™t appear to be too sympathetic and offered a free breakfast (when we already had a breakfast-inclusive rate). then offered a late checkout and we had already arranged that.,The view from the room was superb and the breakfast /restaurant staff were very polite and efficient.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Maureen,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 30  2017,4.6,The room was dirty!!! There was mold in the shower! Dust build up on the exhaust fan in the bathroom. Dust build up on the carpet around the beds and walls. We called each day for extra towels and a pillow that we never received! Our last day we waited until 6pm and no one came to clean our room or refresh our towels! At that point we had a Manager come up to the room. After showing him the filth he did apologize and had 1 night deducted from the bill. I would never stay there again!!!,The location was great and the parking attendants were excellent

Hyatt Regency Boston,Anonymous,Israel,8 Reviews,September 22  2017,10,We were surprised to be charged for the 3rd person's breakfast.This was inspite of the fact that breskfast was included in the reservation. And this is also what we were told at the front desk when we arrived.

Hyatt Regency Boston,Kristin,United States of America,1 review,September 19  2017,6.3,We were out of our room all day on day 2 and when we returned at 5:30pmour room still had not been cleaned. Someone finally came by around 6pmand asked if we wanted our room cleaned. we said yes but to please comeback on 15 minutes while we were at dinner. When we came back at 9:30pmour room still had not been cleaned. We called the front desk and theysaid they "would make a note" Half an hour later at 10pm wegot a call asking if we wanted someone to clean our room. Seriously at10pmat night when our kids were getting ready for bed?! They had allday! We declined and asked that they at least bring fresh towels. Hotelsin Boston are pricey so it was a lot to pay for a room with no cleaningservice for our 2 night. 3 day stay.,Location was great. within walking distance or quick Uber ride toeverywhere we wanted to go.

Hyatt Regency Boston,Bee,United States of America,1 review,September 14  2017,9.6,Kinda wished someone helped me with my bags (I had 2 suitcases and a backpack on top of handbag) but it wasn't a biggie. I couldn't log into the WiFi but I only stayed a night so it wasn't a big deal either. Also kinda wished that they could give complimentary breakfast for solo travelers but it wasn't a pain. I also wish that they would be more helpful about providing information on getting to the hotel from the airport or bus station.,I arrived at close to 12am and the receptionist was super friendly and patient. The bed was super comfy and the bathroom was great. The room was pretty spacious as well.

Hyatt Regency Boston,Stephanie,United States of America,1 review,August 23  2017,7.5,I couldn't find a pamphlet or booklet on the hotel so really didn't know about most of the amenities available to guests.

However. the asst. manager (Riquel) perfonally emailed me to apologize for the matter. Appreciate the personal touch.,Great location. just minutes walk from Boston South Station. Also adjacent are some really tasty eats (Boston Chinatown) and nice Irish bars (Black Rose). Very convenient to reach the Boston Harbor as well (by walk). There are a few shops nearby as well.

Hyatt Regency Boston,Michelle,United States of America,1 review,July 20  2017,5.4,No shuttle to/from airport or bus terminal.  For price of nights stay one would expect this - as all other hotels offer this.  Coffee in room was horrible.  Staff wasn't very helpful when asking locations of various places - seemed no one knew the area.  Bedding/towels/etc weren't refreshed everyday. we had to ask for everything - even toilet paper.  A hot tub would have been nice in pool area.,The doorman was very friendly/helpful.

Hyatt Regency Boston,jengustin,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 19  2017,9.6,At one point. we couldn't get into our room and it was after a long day......reason being the battery on the door that scans the key card died and we had to wait about 1/2 hour to get it fixed.

Hyatt Regency Boston,Shabriel,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 12  2017,8.8,I've stayed at this location before and I like it. This recent time I had a minor incident. I booked my room through booking and I requested a king size room. When I got the checked in and went to my room I was placed in a room with two queen sized beds without my knowledge. I than go downstairs to the front desk and tell them that I booked a king size room and showed him my reservation. He said to me you booked through booking right. I said yes he said well than it's not guarantee which room you get. I never heard that before. I felt I wasn't getting treated fairly since I booked through booking.com,N/A
Hyatt Regency Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 10  2017,8.3,The AC was too high... The gym was so cold it made working out difficult. The room was nice. the bed was great BUT. there were no drawers to put our clothes in only a small poorly designed closet unit.  The housekeeping staff was truly strange... They kept taking our towels etc. but did not replace them. It was a battle to keep towels in the bathroom.  The rest of the staff was very nice. especially Faoud. he was great. The concierge was excellent... Very helpful.,The location and view
Hyatt Regency Boston,Tyra,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 8  2017,8.3,Maid service was not completed before we returned home from a day of adventure. It's not acceptable to be cleaning rooms after 5 pm when we leave before 7 am and are gone for 10 hours. Our maid did an excellent job other than that. Awkward pool arrangement. enter on sixth floor and walk down stairs to access pool through gym area.,Bed was comfortable. Hotel is steps from the opera and we walked to see Wicked. Hotel is connected to Macy's via an elevator and short hallway. Concierge was friendly. Boston Club sandwich was delicious. had it twice!
Hyatt Regency Boston,Steve,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 5  2017,7.5,Site states check-in at 4pm. We got there at 1230. Spoke with rep and was told we would have room on 17th floor with good view of Boston and bags will be delivered.  You'll get a text when your room is ready. Went out to do some shopping. got text at 430. Went back to settle in. Spoke with a different rep. Put us in room 928 stating no rooms available above 9th floor. Checked on room lovely view of old industrial bldg. Not. Took 30 minutes before finally finding the room on floor 17. Had to wait an additional 15 minutes for a cleaning manager to inspect it and give us the ok to go up. Got the go ahead only to find the cleaning lady STILL vacuuming the room. Had to wait a few more minutes in the hallway for her to clear out. Next morning wife &amp; I went to breakfast let 16 year old daughter sleep in. Put do not disturb sign out. Got back and daughter told us cleaning lady came in &amp; asked if we were leaving today. Glad they supply that sign for no reason. Will not be going back to that location. Even thought was quite convenient.,Breakfast was delicious. A bit pricey. Buffet is overpriced.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Andrea,United States of America,4 Reviews,July 5  2017,8.3,Bathroom well-appointed (good hair dryer) but water pressure was just average. We were given a larger than normal corner room to allow for rollaway beds for our two teenage boys. We were on the top floor which we appreciated for the view. unfortunately. the room was quite warm. The AC did not cool the room more than 72 degrees; the engineers said there was nothing more they could do. Our refrigerator worked very poorly and we lost all our breakfast foods. Breakfast was comped one morning but what we really wanted was a replacement refrigerator.,Very well-equipped workout room. Great location.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Win,United States of America,1 review,July 5  2017,3.3,The price was 30% higher when I booked one day ahead. They only took the higher price booking price. Not feeling well at all.,There are so many better choices out there.

Hyatt Regency Boston,Julie,United States of America,1 review,June 25  2017,9.6,The business center wasn't working properly and i wasn't able to print my boarding pass for free.

The bed was comfortable and the temperature of the room was perfect for us.  The staff was amazing. They were helpful and answered all of our questions and gave great recommendations. The hotel is perfectly located in the theater district and it's just a short walk to anywhere you might want to go.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Voula,Australia,3 Reviews,June 18  2017,10,Not a lot to fault. but if I have to find something it's the curtains. they didn't close properly. so light emitted through. Also cleaners didn't always top up items like cotton buds and shower cap.,Loved the room and the location. Close to cafes. restaurants and shops. Easy walking distance to most places of interest. Lots of clothes hangers and hooks.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Anonymous,Thailand,3 Reviews,June 15  2017,5.4,Staff who checked us in/out wasn't so welcoming. I don't know if it was the reason that we have different skin color or he wasn't just motivated to work. We also had a problem with credit card that it can be used worldwide and there was no balance on it. The staff informed us that the card we used for payment didnt work so we used another one. As soon as we flew back to home country. there was a small charge on the credit card that didn't work.Surprise surprise surpise.,We got dirty towels that there were reddish yellowish stains on. Contacted Front Office about it. A staff said he would send new towels up. Hours later. nobody came up. I got tired. Went straight to bed. Called Front Office again in the morning. finally somebody brought up new fresh towels. Also. in the bathroom. the finishes weren't finished. The plug socket was about to come off. there were dirty spots on the wall...This hotel deserves to be just a 4 star not 5.

Hyatt Regency Boston,Ashley,United States of America,1 review,June 12  2017,9.6,N/A,We left a bag in a taxi. and the Hyatt Security team worked with us to try and track it down. We were unable to locate it. but not for lack of assistance. The room was immaculate. every member of the team was helpful. friendly. and polite. and the room service that we ordered when we got in late was amazing after a day of stress and travel. I look forward to staying there again the next time I have the opportunity to visit Boston.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Laurie,United States of America,1 review,June 7  2017,10,We were woken up at 5:45AM by bass and thumping techno music. courtesy of one of our next door neighbors. Not the hotel's fault. just a marr on an otherwise excellent stay.We also decided to spring for pricey. but convenient breakfast room service and were a little disappointed to have barely warm food and a soggy waffle. It arrived promptly at the time we ordered it for and was delivered to our room by a very nice guest services staff member. but for the price was far from worth it.,The man that checked us in was great and the bartender was super friendly and helpful.The view on the 17th floor was incredible and the room was a great size for being a hotel downtown!
Hyatt Regency Boston,Renata,Brazil,2 Reviews,June 5  2017,9.2,The breakfast is very expensive,I really like the localization that is in downtown and easy for walk in the city. Boston is an amazing city and very green. The hotel is very good and good accommodations.

Hyatt Regency Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,7 Reviews,May 23  2017,6.3,There are a couple of small things that disappointed me. First I really don't understand why the housekeeper had to knock our door around 10am on a Saturday morning. We did not hear her knocking. so she got someone to pick the lock. This just sounds ridiculous to me. Second. the makeup mirror in the bathroom was not clean. I don't really want to describe how it looked. Third. the gym has only one shower in the female changing room. And the last thing is that the water pressure of the shower in the room was poor.,Great location. It has a walking distance to the train station. China town. and Newbury street; basically everywhere that we planned to visit.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Tom,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,May 21  2017,10,N/A,Staff were brilliant. in particular the guys at the entrance helping with travel and greeting you . Pool is great and was nice a quiet . open until 11pm which was good . Amazing view from our room at the top floor and comfy bed.

Hyatt Regency Boston,Anonymous,Canada,1 review,May 10  2017,9.6,If you are walking. the entrance seems out of the way unless you walk through Macy's store.

Hyatt Regency Boston,Zikar,United States of America,4 Reviews,May 3  2017,7.9,I had only one incident with a coffee machine that wasn't working.. and I called 3 times to be replaced with a working one. The first time replaced came with no filter and thus was leaking and brewing properly. and it took more than 15 minutes to be delivered.  Then I called again and asked for replacement and left the room. and came back after 5 hours and still the same machine. so I asked to talk to a manager who sent Housekeeping manager (I guess) to replace it.I actually work in 5 stars hotel. and I know exactly how the quality and speed of service are. which made it surprising to me for this small/possible change to be made.,I did like the cleanliness of the hotel and nice view of the room.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Plus the location is very suitable and close to downtown.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Mirna,United States of America,1 review,May 2  2017,9.2,Breakfast was a bad experience. waited over 30 minutes for an omelette that arrived cold.

The beds were comfy. hotel was really in the middle of all the action.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Satya,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,April 25  2017,10,N/A,This a high quality. spacious hotel with modern fittings. It is brilliantly located in the theatre district with excellent restaurants in walking distance and a shopping area. There is good access to public transport across the city. The big appeal is the excellent attitude and responsiveness of the Manager and staff. They were helpful in dealing with requests and minor issues. Our queen-queen room was spacious and incredibly comfortable. We were 2 adults and 2 children. staying for a week. and there was plenty of space to not feel as though we were on top of each other. I highly recommend this hotel.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Sheila,United States of America,1 review,April 20  2017,6.3,Although the rooms were kept clean we had to either call the desk or go find a housekeeper to get more towels. washcloths and toiletries 3 of the 4 days we were there.  One day we were given smeary looking drinking glasses in our room.  We didn't like that we had to pay for a couple of copies that we needed and were charged by the 10 min. to use the computer/printer. Printing boarding passes were free. but when we got to the airport they wouldn't scan (ink too light) so we had to print new ones at the airport.  When we checked out of the hotel the man at the desk told us that our bill was $750. more than what my paperwork showed. When I showed him my bill through Booking.com he gave it to us for that amount. but he rolled his eyes and had an attitude!,It was a very attractive hotel with comfortable beds and a nice restaurant. The concierge was great with restaurant recommendations and always helpful.  The bartender was also kind to give me a can of ginger beer w/o charging when I asked if they had some. They also had great support for the Boston Marathon runners like water. protein bars and bananas the morning of the race plus people there to cheer the runners when they returned to the hotel.  It was near enough to the Boston commons and gardens that we could walk. It also backs up to a large shopping mall w/ access to Macy's through their parking garage...nice surprise!
Hyatt Regency Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,April 14  2017,8.3,The selection of free weights in the gym was pretty limited - no olympic bar or decent barbell set up. Also no squat rack/cage.,Buffet breakfast was good. especially as it was included in our room rate
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Victoria,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,November 2  2017,8.3,We didn't realise that "parking" meant valet parking at $55/night - an unwelcome surprise. Comfortable top floor room but absolutely no view at all,Lovely Frette sheets and very comfortable bed.  Very charming and helpful staff. who went the extra mile to assist us.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Eliana,Panama,11 Reviews,October 31  2017,8.3,No many restaurants available without reservations. it can get very busy in the afternoons due to the theatre area. this very good to reserve in advance your dinners,Very central and restaurant next to it. left and right are very good!
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Anne,Australia,18 Reviews,October 31  2017,6.3,We had so many disappointing experiences with this hotel. At check in their banking systems would not accept an international prepaid card. Paying by cash involved a long wait and a struggle with the front desk.  A valuable parcel went missing for 24 hours. Beware the rooms are very small - you will barely be able to move if you have more than one suitcase.There is no bar fridge to keep your supplies cool. Two mornings of our stay the showers were cold. The cleaning staff were rude and disrespectful - perhaps badly trained in hotel protocols. There is no business centre and the front lobby seating area was often full of students using the free wifi and difficult to find a table to sit if you got tired of the room. I think you can do better in Boston for the price that this hotel charges. I simply would not recommend it again and will book elsewhere for our next trip to Boston.,This hotel is in a great location opposite Macy's and Downtown Crossing. It's close to Boston Common and to the Public Gardens.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Philip,Canada,2 Reviews,October 30  2017,6.7,I’m sure most people enjoy their stay.  However if you are in the second floor be aware of the fact that the restaurant on the main floor plays loud music with room rattling bass.  This was my wife and my first trip away from our children in 3 years and were very excited for a soundless sleep.  When I called reception it was like I was the first to ever complain which surely cannot be the case.  They could not move us to another room as the hotel was booked. so they offered a $20 voucher for breakfast and to move us the next night.  I spent $500 a night CDN to stay at this hotel. couldn’t fall asleep for 2.5 hours because of their restaurant and I was offered a $20 breakfast voucher?  To me that is unacceptable and therefore would not recommend this property to anyone.  There are so many options in Boston - find a different one that values their patrons.,The location is fantastic.  Very close to the harbour. Boston Common. historic sites and the T.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Malcolm,United Kingdom,1 review,October 29  2017,10,Nothing,Excellent hotel. room was brilliant. great views. superb location. staff were superb. If I returned to Boston I wouldn't even look anywhere else for a hotel the Godfrey is definitely my first choice
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,T,Ireland,20 Reviews,October 29  2017,10,Nothing. Wish we had stayed for longer!,Top class hotel. Friendly professional staff. excellent location and all of the finishing touches you always hope for but don't always get! Great rooms. Very very comfortable beds
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Stacey,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 27  2017,7.1,Was very disappointed in the cleanliness of the room.  The fold out sofa had dirty sheets on it.  They were very quick to come make it right but was icky and that is where my children were going to sleep.,N/A
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Ruthi,United States of America,1 review,October 26  2017,5.0,The hotel was loud. the room was tiny. the bed was not comfortable. the shower was minimalisticThe price was exorbitant for the room/serviceThe adjacent coffee shop was pretentious (selection of pastors and food was limited and expensive),Not muchStaff was pleasant (but quite amateurish)
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Roz,United States of America,1 review,October 24  2017,9.2,The rooms in the Godfrey do not have dresser drawers and the closets are very narrow. The hangers are on a rod that dips down toward you as you open the doors. So getting clothes on and off hangers is a little difficult.,The Godfrey is a good-looking boutique hotel. smart. simple and sophisticated. The reception desk is staffed with intelligent people. Our room looked very comfortable and hip. and the bathroom is a decent size with a large shower.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Ey1983,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,October 24  2017,9.2,We must have come at a time of a big event in Boston because there were so few rooms available throughout the city and those that were - were extremely expensive. Can't blame the hotel for keeping their prices high in line with the competition. but it really was unusually pricey for us at the time.,The mattresses were absolutely amazing! Very comfortable and clean room with a great air conditioning system which keeps the room at a steady nice temperature. There is also complimentary coffee which comes in so handy when recovering from jet lag. Lovey staff. fantastic location!
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Roman,United States of America,11 Reviews,October 23  2017,8.3,The room was a little smaller than I would prefer. But it's okay for one night stay.Price was too high.,Modern hotel in the heart of Boston. Beautiful lobby and comfortable room.Many restaurants close to the hotel. Nice coffee shop right behind the lobby.The girl on the reception was extremely friendly and explained everything perfectly clear.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,October 17  2017,8.3,Surprised that the barman wouldn't make a Bloody Mary but suggested we go to a boozer around the corner instead! However the cocktails he did make for us were excellent.The maid did not replace used mugs or tea/coffee for the second dayBar &amp; coffee shop should be open longer hours for residents,Very convenient for downtown Boston. Doormen good. Receptionist on arrival was excellent
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Anonymous,New Zealand,2 Reviews,October 17  2017,10,Room service not available after 11pm so had to go down to McDonald's,Staff were very friendly at the front desk which creates an inviting atmosphere
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Jonathan,United States of America,1 review,October 16  2017,5.8,The staff when we first got there were not very friendly. or attentive in the least. Waited on the room for an hour and forty five minutes! (After we had already arrived thirty minutes after check in time.)The room was dirty when we finally were allowed to get in it. Not like it just had been quickly cleaned. just seriously not cleaned.The toilet definitely had not been cleaned since urine was dried on it and the seat had black stuff(?) on the underside. The rugs had crumbs and pieces of paper in almost every area. The couch had crumbs on the seats and arms. The desk had pieces of food and styrofoam on the top of it.The elevators are operated with the room card. but nobody told us. Another guest ended up informing us not any staff. It’s pretty degrading to have guest laugh at you then show you where the card reader is.Elevator room door is propped open with a ripped up cardboard boxThe view from 712 is a storm trooper pointing their gun at you. I get it’s beyond their control but just iced the cake honestly.,The hotel is perfectly modern. and the lobby is spotless. The staff in general were just average. Some were great and others just seemed to hate their job. (I will say the guy on  sat late night/sun early am at the desk was absolutely phenomenal and ridiculously attentive!) The location of the Godfrey is seriously ideal. It’s easy to get to and close to everywhere in the city. Shockingly quiet for the area. Amazingly comfortable beds and linens.The shower is dreamy good!It seems they know when they mess up and try to make up for it a little. (Coffee and anniversary gift)The surprise happy anniversary card. champagne. chocolates. and coffee shop vouchers were certainly the highlight and got The Godfrey almost a whole star in this review.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Trevor,Australia,1 review,October 16  2017,5.8,Small room looking out to back fire escape. No coffee tea facilities. Hardly room for second cases.A lot of outside night road workers noise.Poor lighting. One bedside light for whole bedroom.We paid the same as the Bellagio Las Vegas for fountain room!,Location and staff
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,October 13  2017,10,There was nothing not to like!,Everything! This is the best hotel I have ever stayed in! The staff were friendly and efficient- nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were outstanding. Can’t wait to stay again in the future!
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Billy,United States of America,1 review,October 11  2017,8.8,Thought the lighting in the room was not adequate.  Too dim.,The displayed art was very well chosen.  Good clean modern design.  Good value and convenience for the morning breakfast café.  Roll-away beds were very useful and convenient.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Jeanne,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 11  2017,9.2,As with busy big cities. there did seem to be some homeless in the area.  We were not disturbed but as a couple of senior citizens it was a little uncomfortable.,We choose this hotel because of its proximity to the Freedom Trail.  We were in talking distance to Boston Commons and office of hop on hop off bus office.  The staff was professional and pleasant. They stored our bags for us until our room was ready and let us know by text when it was ready.  We had disembarked from a cruise ship that morning.  We were in walking distance to the subway.  A variety of restaurants were close by.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,October 10  2017,6.3,No dedicated hotel coffee shop or restaurant. Adjacent coffee shop had long queues and was hard to find table. Room small (906),Comfortable bed. Room very clean.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 10  2017,8.3,Too smallToo expensive Not enough space Needs two end tables Not enough plug ins Did not get lotions. shampoo etc daily Too modern. hip . Need a balanceNo microwave,Had refrigerator Nice shower
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Roughy,United States of America,20 Reviews,October 10  2017,10,Always like a small refrigerator in the room which ours did not have.,One street from Boston Common so location was ideal. Very modern and extremely comfortable bed and great shower.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Miriam,Ireland,1 review,October 10  2017,8.8,I didn't like the hotel pillows - very flat but that's just a personal thing. The attached coffee shop didn't have a great breakfast menu. we found that throughout Boston though. breakfast isn't a big thing and the bar in the hotel was quite limited.,Hotel spotless and very modern. Super location. within walking distance to everything. Located in the theater district. so if you fancy a show - its on your doorstep. Plenty of nice restaurants in the immediate locality. Would definitely recommend.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Anonymous,Ireland,2 Reviews,October 10  2017,10,The hotel itself was perfect. The only downside was the amount of homeless on the street.literally across the street from our window. Both saddening and concerning from a security viewpoint.,Extremely clean and the room smelt fresh. Friendly staff. Nice smelling products. very comfy bed and generous size tv.The shower was excellent as re space. cleanliness. power and temperature.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Beth,United States of America,6 Reviews,October 9  2017,10,N/A,Upon checking in we were asked why we were in town. When we said we were on our honeymoon they surprised use by sending up a complimentary bottle of iced champagne and two breakfast vouchers. It was extremely thoughtful.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Mike,United Kingdom,1 review,October 9  2017,5.0,I thought the service was absolutely atrocious. I should probably note that myself and my girlfriend stayed at the Peninsula Chicago before flying to Boston so maybe the peninsula set the bar very high in our eyes but still I thought we would have received a much better service at The Godfrey especially with reading the previous reviews. Anyway. on arrival. we weren’t welcomed with a smile. hello. or how are you?! Just “ID Card and Credit Card please” yes they did end with a please but the tone of voice and the unwelcoming vibe they gave off made to a very bad start especially as no one had even volunteered to help with our bags...we had 2 x 21kg luggage bags so any help would have been appreciated but nope. nothing at all! During our stay. the only people that ever really smiled and said hello were the door staff. The front desk weren’t helpful. weren’t welcoming and overall made myself and my partner feel very unwelcome. There was one nice young lady who handed our bags back to us as we left them there after check out and she seemed nice and smiled but these rare moments were so few it’s a shame. I will end by saying that Boston is a very beautiful city and we would definitely stay in Boston again. either again in the Downtown area or in the Back Bay but I would definitely not be staying at the Godfrey Hotel Boston ever again.,Location. location. location!! Right next to downtown crossing so easy to get to places further afield such as Harvard. Downtown location mean it was easy to walk everywhere.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,October 4  2017,9.6,Bathroom sliding door does not close to give complete privacy. Very large gap around sides when shut. No shower gels provided as do most hotels. only soap and shampoo provided.,Decor and modern facilities.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Stephen,United Kingdom,1 review,October 4  2017,7.1,We were put into a room less than what we paid for for the first two nights. When we realised and questioned this to a member of staff (on our first morning). it was made out to be our fault for not saying anything sooner. We were eventually moved to our paid for room for the second half of our stay. The main light in the second room did not work. the USB chargers in the second room did not work. the TV's in both rooms are of extremely poor quality. both unresponsive to any sort use of the remote and fuzzy on most channels.,Comfortable beds. good location for exploring the city by foot. clean and safe area.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Karen,Australia,21 Reviews,October 4  2017,7.9,We had a bad experience in the bar when we asked for our half bottle to be stored for the next night but it couldn't be found. They did not offer to refund us.,Fantastic location right in town and easy walking to Boston Common and city sights. Rooms were lovely. not huge but good amenities.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 4  2017,8.8,Towels too roughGood idea to employ an older concierge who knows Boston really well,Comfy bedExcellent service -front door. bell and guest services desk
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Garry,United Kingdom,1 review,October 3  2017,5.8,Staff members seemed inexperienced and not knowledgable about basics. They were poor at dealing with problems ( such as assigning the wrong room - this took ages to sort) and although pleasant. a bit inept. The rooms are ok but the air conditioning is really loud. The cafe attached had a staff member with a cold and a drip on the end of his nose! Not appealing!,Great location. close to Boston common so easy to walk to most places. Close to the subway. Modern and clean.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Melody,United States of America,1 review,October 2  2017,10,It was absolutely nothing. nothing at all. that we did not like.,This was a beautiful. elegant. modern Hotel with everything you could ever want! It was lovely. The beds were like sleeping on a cloud with the most beautiful sheets and pillows. And the view. phenomenal! We are definitely going to stay at the Godfrey Motel again. Not to mention the Exquisite George Howell coffee shop downstairs with wonderful coffee drinks and pastry. And the rest O Bar is something you just have to experience!
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Greg,South Africa,1 review,September 28  2017,10,N/A,The beds were exceptionally comfortable.  There is a variety of shop across the road which makes shopping bliss.  It was so convenient to have the underground so close.  The staff were super friendly.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Mary,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 26  2017,7.5,Beds were not great. too soft.  Felt like you were sinking through. Side street along hotel became very rough and dangerous after dark. Lots of homeless people in the area around the hotel.,Decor was nice. staff was friendly. nice coffee shop adjacent to lobby.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,"dora,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,September 25  2017,9.2,N/A,The door personnel were extremely friendly and helpful and made our arrival and departure so much easier as we had driven to the hotel!

The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Marilyn,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 23  2017,7.9,Did not like the barn door on bathroom. Could have used more storage and a mirror in main room for second person to put on makeup. etc.,Room was very nice and beds were comfortable. The shower was great!

The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,September 21  2017,9.6,Only dislike. maybe the wardrobe in the room wasn't big enough for a full bag of clothes. but this is a minor point that did not spoil the trip.,Location was excellent for proximity to walk around central Boston and nearby stations to outlying locations. Room and hotel was to a high standard.  All staff were courteous and helpful.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Elizabeth,United States of America,1 review,September 20  2017,7.1,Not a thing : ),The room was nice. I love the mirror for make-up. The staff was very helpful. giving us some directions when we needed....your little café was terrific. and the location was great!!  The only thing I wish I could change was the cost of the hotel.  There were 4 of us and we had to stay in One room. otherwise we couldn't afford to stay there! ....and I also appreciated talking to a real live person when I called. You were very helpful in getting us a driver to get from the airport to your place....oh. I can't remember his name. but he was great!!
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Meggan,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 19  2017,9.6,N/A,The location was great-lots of cool restaurants nearby as well as walking distance to Faneuil Hall and other popular sites. The hotel was also clean and well-kept. Staff was super nice too!

The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,8 Reviews,September 11  2017,9.2,Sliding barn door for the bathroom - not soundproof. Lacks privacy. Also. pricey for just a room.

The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Robert Sheridan,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 10  2017,8.3,Furniture in room had no drawers for clothing. Armoire could hang no more than 8 garments and 4 of them had to be sorter than 30" from top of hanger to bottom of garment. Had to partially live out of luggage.Tried to bill us for valet parking -though we didn't have a car. Called front desk. dealt with surly manager who told asked me "Has it been billed to your card?" - Of course not - the problem is it's on the bill. I was told to go to front desk and get it fixed at checkout. SO - no "express check out" because they can't fix the bill unless I wait on line for 30 minutes when I have a flight to catch.,Room was clean and very modern in design. Comfortable beds. HUGE windows. Location is at the end of a pedestrian only zone and very close to the subway - only 1 stop away from South Station. Close to Boston Commons and Public Garden - less than 1 mile to Fanueil Hall. the Aquarium etc. A little further to the North End.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Philip,United States of America,1 review,September 10  2017,4.6,Not a traveler's hotel. No sit-down breakfast. No room service until 11AM (!!!). Staff young and distant. Didn't reach out to solve my problems. Cool place for milennials to stare at their iphones. Bad place for busy travelers like me.,Clean. Well maintained.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Damesh,Kazakhstan,6 Reviews,September 8  2017,8.3,The room was dark.  there were little cold. but humid. I couldn't open the window.

The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Darlene,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 8  2017,10,Nothing ... it really was great!,We loved everything ! We were always greeted by the front desk staff. Our room had a welcoming vibe to it. And that made it easy to relax.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,David,Ireland,5 Reviews,September 4  2017,6.3,The room was expensive considering the facilities. With the exception of a welcome bottle of Cava  from the manager there was very little that caused the hotel to stand out.,The location was great. It was a short walk to Boston Common. the T and the harbor which made getting around Boston very easy. It was clean and quiet and the staff were helpful when needed.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Cynthia,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 24  2017,8.8,The beds were hot,The beds had plastic covers over the matress and pillows so it got hot in the bed.  That is my only complaint. The staff was forthcoming about street noise if we wanted a view. so we chose the quiet side which had a view of the surrounding buildings of an industrial courtyard but it was dark and quiet which is exactly what we wanted. There was no breakfast. but there was a wonderful coffee cafe next door with an entry from the lobby and I easily took my latte and coffe cake up to my room. Everything else was fantastic.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Tim,Netherlands,4 Reviews,August 22  2017,8.3,The matrass in the pull-out sofa is of very low quality. Not in line with the standard of the rest of the room. The television and internet facilities in the room are great but not extremely user friendly,Very modern comfortable rooms
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Anne,France,4 Reviews,August 21  2017,8.3,The canapé lit was bad quality (very thin mattress) for such a 4* hotel and room was small for 3 people... A pool in addition to sport equipment would have been appreciated as business commodities for 4* hotel.Expensive (no breakfast),Very confortable beds / clean / very good location
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Owen,Canada,1 review,August 15  2017,10,N/A,I would highly recommend The Godfrey Hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and attentive. with an extra special thanks to Lily for her thoughtfulness. The hotel was immaculately clean and the location was great.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Michele,United States of America,1 review,August 14  2017,8.3,Lobby was noisy.  Bar should be closed off.  Pillows too soft.

The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Joseph,United States of America,1 review,August 14  2017,10,I would have like to have known that the on-site parking was valet and would come at a significant cost. That was never indicated initially or on the hotel's website and it would have been nice to know.,The service was impeccable and when they found out that it was my partner's birthday. they sent her complimentary champagne and cupcakes to the room with a card. Amazing and they went above and beyond to give us a very special experience!
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Stina,Sweden,11 Reviews,August 12  2017,8.8,The staff in the front desk was very unfriendly. not at all serviceminded. The rest of the staff was very nice.,Very good locations in theatrical district and good shopping - and near subway. Very nice hotel and excellent rooms.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Lynne,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 12  2017,9.2,The next morning. we wanted a real breakfast. not just a coffee shop. and the two girls at the front desk couldn't suggest one place where we could get french toast. Otherwise. everything was great!,This place was such an excellent choice. The location was PERFECT for walking around the city and getting to the theater district (we went to Tom Petty and Toad the Wet Sprocket). To start. the girl at the front desk was so friendly. I wish I had gotten her name. but she had a beautiful afro. The hotel was beautiful. and the staff was very helpful.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Javeriah,United States of America,1 review,August 11  2017,5.4,Checking in took longer then expected because the system had crashed that morning. Then I was sent to the wrong room and later I had to ask to change my room because I just didn't like it. Not all the staff at the front desk was particularly helpful. Other then one gentlemen who smiled every morning and listened when I complained about an issue (slow check in!). the rest of the staff was not as receptive and approachable. The part of the world I belong to this is considered unacceptable. at a hotel this expensive the one thing that is guaranteed is an amazing staff!,I loved the location. it was very Central and accessible. A lot of shops and restaurant are right around the corner. especially for a tourist like myself. The room was clean and minimalistic. which I like.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Raymond,United States of America,1 review,August 8  2017,7.5,no business office or access to computers. to print ;your boarding passes,king bed very comfortable. lobby bar nice but very small. pics on web site make it appear much larger
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Jeana,United States of America,16 Reviews,August 8  2017,9.6,The music was so loud in the lobby it was difficult to hear anyone and made the check in process annoying,Stylish upbeat Hôtel with a very nice coffee bar next door.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Roberta,United States of America,1 review,August 7  2017,6.3,Reservation in their system was not correct and I had the reservation confirmation  and they still could not accommodate our original reservation. Had to change rooms 3 times and had to have one of our party sleep on the floor the first night. While they reduced the room rate I felt the room for the first night should have been comp'ed or they should have found us another hotel. They made the error but were not overly sympathetic. Said we needed to sort out with booking.com.  Then I believe they saw their error and offered to call and reduce room rate. We wasted our limited time having to deal with their error. Expectations were not met.,Good bartender in lobby. Nice room once we finally got the room we had teserved. Good location. Friendly doormen
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Clint,United States of America,1 review,August 7  2017,7.9,The room could have been a little more spacious. The location seemed to be in a bad part of town judging by the numerous homeless people laying about the street both day and night.,Very comfortable bed. Close to public transportation and the Freedom Trail.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Anonymous,Saudi Arabia,9 Reviews,August 3  2017,8.3,A bit pricey. elevators are small. slow and infrequent (three serve the entire hotel). couldn't get connecting rooms,Trendy.

The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Megan,United States of America,4 Reviews,August 2  2017,9.2,I wish they would have had breakfast and a pool.  Our room faced the street by my choice. noisy. busy street.  Wouldn't pick that side again.,Awesome location.  At the end the the block was the Boston Commons and the start of the Freedom Trail.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  An elegant but yet simple hotel.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Karen,United States of America,4 Reviews,August 2  2017,4.6,The bed! I have a serious backache (24 hours home) from the bed! It had a trough in it - a body sized indent from head to toe. A very poor choice on the part of the property to purchase " pillow top " mattresses for a hotel! They SUCK. The indent felt like a valley when I wanted to roll over. They should replace all the mattresses with a Casper!When we checked in. we had a choice of a  'quiet' room or a room with daylight! Ug. For $300./night. we were on the 3rd floor overlooking a tight street with little day light and morning construction noise. I need quiet AND light. The room was nice but small. and there was no mini fridge for my food. which I travel with.Nothing about it makes me want to stay there ever again.,Liked the coffee shop in the lobby; really good coffee.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,cwcw,Ireland,11 Reviews,August 2  2017,8.8,The staff were not very friendly and did not provide much information upon check in. When we checked out (at 3:30am) the receptionist asked for our room number then took 15 minutes typing on the computer before finally saying 'ok you are checked out'. He didn't ask us how our stay was and I asked him for a receipt or invoice for our stay and he said it would be sent to us by booking.com but always I have received a receipt directly from the hotel.,The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. The location was perfect. there was so much to do very close by and the style of the hotel was luxurious
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Keith,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,July 30  2017,9.6,Would have been better to have somewhere in the hotel to have breakfast. although there is an attached. separately run public cafe that is fine.,Very nice and efficient staff. very comfortable beds and a spacious room
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Glyn,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 28  2017,8.8,Bed not supportive--more like a hammock!Rooms small--no chair other than desk chair.  We were in executive room with king bed.,Great location--most attractions within walking distance.Clean.Quiet .
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Paul,Canada,2 Reviews,July 26  2017,9.2,N/A,Very comfortable stay with super-cozy beds and all the up-to-date features of a high-end hotel.Centrally located. Wi-Fi worked like a charm with no issues whatsoever.Front desk was great a suggesting a variety of places to eat.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Barbara Ducam-Davies,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,July 23  2017,9.2,The entrance hall could be more CHIC  in terms of design. Two many chairs and sofas and note a sense of space.,The room was spacious and the bathroom has all toiletries and extra towels. Good value for money but it is better to travel a DEUX  otherwise it is same price for single occupancy.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 23  2017,9.6,Expensive but it was high tourist season in Boston. Comparable to other quality hotels in the city around this time.,Fantastic location. beautiful modern hotel. and friendly professional service. Very spacious King room with comfy bed. My daughter and I were in the city for one night to see Wicked and this was the perfect location. Just a couple of doors up from the theater and the perfect hub for sightseeing.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Richard,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 21  2017,10,N/A,Decor was definitely fitting for a boutique hotel. Bathroom was great and had a terrific flooring material - I know that sounds petty. but it really pretty cool. We found the rooms to be very quiet and the beds were very comfortable. Exceptionally new and clean rooms. Having a coffee shop attached to the hotel is brilliant. The Lobby Bar is a great place to hang out in between outings. We really enjoyed the entire experience.

The Godfrey Hotel Boston,A,Belgium,1 review,July 16  2017,8.3,Nice rooms but not really design in any way.,Nice boutique hotel although room design rather plain. The staff was super helpful and lots of good restaurants. shops. historical sites near by. I was given the choice between a room with a view (but noisy) or no view and quiet. I chose a quiet room which worked well for me.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Christopher,United States of America,1 review,July 13  2017,9.2,N/A,Very stylish and modern hotel located in the heart of Boston with easy access to several restaurants. shops. historical sites and the theater district.  Rooms were cozy and utilized space efficiently making the room feel bigger than they are.
The Godfrey Hotel Boston,Richard,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,July 12  2017,8.3,Number of homeless people begging near hotel. My children commented on this.  I accept this is out of hotels control and is city issue to support those less fortunate.,Clean modern hotel. Staff polite and helpful.   24 hour gym. Only basic equipment but does provide towels and drinks.  Has fairly expensive restaurant and coffee shop attached.  Near main shops and attractions and walking distance to metro and station.
Super Location 2 Bedroom by the Green Line with Parking Spot,Patricia,Ireland,1 review,October 2  2017,10,The entrance lobby. hall and stairs area was not very nice.,Apartment was lovely. Very clean. Comfortable beds. Kitchen well kitted out. Hosts always available by email. Excellent location
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Adrienne,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 3  2017,6.3,We did not know that this apartment was in the flight path for the airport and planes started flying at 5 in the morning! We would have picked another property had we known this. The property is advertised as providing sleeping for 5 to 6 adults. The mattress on the pullout bed is one with springs and wires and not sleepable. Our daughter slept on the couch with pillows and it was ok for one. The pillows are the cheapest possible; the toilet paper is 1-ply! We have rented many apartments around the world. This is the first one that did not have any binder. books. tour info etc. in the apartment. Yes there is a concierge who could tell us where to buy groceries and alcohol etc. but this is good information to provide. Many other places have a log where guests make recommendations of tours. restaurants etc. that they enjoyed. This place felt like it was owned by a corporation for an investment and did little to provide anything much extra other than salt and pepper. some foil and saran wrap and paper towels. For the cost of this apartment we expected a more.,Easy walking distance to train and many tourist attractions; the common area on 20th floor with free coffee machine. pool table and large TV. Very clean. Prompt replies to questions.
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Joy,United States of America,1 review,August 21  2017,9.5,A little difficult to find the carport/drop-off area at first. especially because there was some areas blocked of for some road work.  I admit to being a little nervous about check-in as this was our first non-traditional accommodation but the concierge for the apartment building was familiar with the Stay Alfred arrangements so it went relatively smoothly.  The area where you unload is a very tight alley and we felt a little pressure to be quick about unloading as other cars were trying to move through the space to get into the parking garage.Because of the layout of the apartment. while it wasn't uncomfortable. the HVAC was inconsistent from one space to the next.  The master bedroom vent directs air that somehow ricochets off the opposite wall and onto the one side of the bed- I had to switch sides with my husband as he was cold and I was warm.The mattresses seemed relatively new yet hard; the sheets were scratchy and the blankets were synthetic velour which trapped heat.An unexpected downside to staying in a spacious apartment. at least for our family. was being comfortable enough in the space to be less motivated to get out and about as quickly as when you're cooped up in a traditional small hotel room;),Having a place to land for several days as a base for travel in and near Boston was a positive.  Accommodating 2 adults and 3 teens in one place (a King. a Queen and a sofabed with 2 bathrooms) was more economical than having several hotel rooms.  Being able to cook our own breakfast instead of eating out every meal was a good start to the day.  The kitchen was beyond basic with a blender. toaster. and two different kinds of coffeemakers as well as a microwave. full-size range/oven. refrigerator. and apt-size dishwasher.  There was an in-unit laundry set-up which we used several times.  The rooftop patio with a grill. the upstairs lounge area with pool table. and the downstairs lounge area with board games (my kids played chess) as well as the fitness center (husband used it daily) were nice distractions as well.This was our first time in Boston; our main focus in choosing our accommodations were driven by finding something to keep the five of us in one space with high marks for cleanliness at a reasonable price.  The apartment was about a five minute walk to South Station for transit (Red and Silver lines. I think) which seemed to make the location easily accessible though not directly in the heart of the historical sites. Of the three types of accommodations we chose for this New England road trip. my kids preferred this apartment over our other hotel and the B&amp;B we chose later in the week.
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 10  2017,9.2,Away from tourist attractions but short commute from them.  On site parking is expensive but there is a public garage 1 block away.  Could use more lamps/lights in the unit.  Apartment layout puts second bedroom far away from master.,Location was close to the Airport and South Station subway terminal.  Restaurants and coffee shops in walking distance.  Gym and lounge on common floor was well maintained.  Washer &amp; dryer in unit.
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Anonymous,Switzerland,3 Reviews,July 17  2017,9.2,Neighbourhood is somewhat industrial and we had views on parking lots and trucks. No shopping in area. one small convenience market a couple of blocks away and only one "breakfast" venue also a couple blocks away.  Distances for shopping a bit far for non-walkers and Boston roads and streets always have traffic jams that create expensive taxi and Uber rides back to property after shopping.,N/A
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,HGH29,United Arab Emirates,3 Reviews,June 16  2017,9.6,The corridors need to be slightly ventilated or room fresheners need to be setup. Our floor was stinking of fried fish all the time; and the neighbouring residents had left their big dog out in the corridor which was intimidating and pretty scary for some of the food delivery men.,We had initially booked a 2 bedroom Penthouse Loft. but due to mix-up on the Proprty's side. we were upgraded free of charge to a 3 bedroom loft in the sister property. It was not much of an inconvenience. The flat was very good.
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Luisa,United States of America,1 review,June 16  2017,9.2,The sofa bed is  mega uncomfortable. The wires feel awful. My son complained every night.

Washer and dryer machine with detergent included.
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Nancy Mayalu,United States of America,1 review,June 12  2017,9.6,The blinds in the bedroom were not the right type. Would recommend that the proterty owners consider a blind system that blocks out the sun more in the bedrooms. Was a little suprised at the size of some of the dogs (150+ lbs)on the property. But. that said. our stay was very pleasant.,This place was great for our family of 5. The apt was clean. comfortable. and had everything that we needed for our stay. Also loved that the location was a quick 8 min walk to the "south station" T stop. Thank you Stay Alfred!

A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Kim,Canada,2 Reviews,March 17  2017,9.6,the nest temp control is funky and drops a few hours after setting. and on a cold windy day as we had 2. the apartment was chilly with whistling wind leaks.

But keys were there! so in we went. Bring copy of your reservation!!,was able to check in a few hours early as no one was in it the night before. suite was great for 2 road warriors with 2 bath and 2 bedrooms and living area.

A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Tina,United States of America,1 review,September 15  2016,10,It had 2 thermostats unknown to us because one was in the bedroom behind the TV.   It controlled both bedrooms and  was set on a program that would turn the heat on.    We had the air set. then we would come in and it was very hot.,Excellent location and view.
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Joanna,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,August 21  2016,9.6,The one downside was that only one key was provided to use between the 5 of us - the lady on the front desk pointed out the other one was missing. I took this up with Stay Alfred via email who said they would get another key to us as soon as possible. Unfortunately this meant that we had to stick together as a group. which was against our plans as we were hoping to have some separate adult/teenage time in Boston. Sadly the key still hadn't arrived by the time we left. I wasn't impressed with Stay Alfred's attitude to this as I explained our situation but they still failed to provide us with another key to replace the missing one before we left. Thankfully this didn't spoil our enjoyment of this wonderful city!,The apartment was lovely. modern and clean with all we needed; I'd definitely recommend staying there. The location was fab; just a short walk to the river and the heart of Boston. The apartment block had a very relaxed atmosphere and was also home to private residents and their adorable dogs.
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Melissa,United States of America,1 review,August 14  2016,9.6,Stay Alfred has poor customer service. The power was shut off in one of the rooms and they didn't follow up for over 12 hours.,The apartment was clean and the bedrooms were a really nice size.

A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Richard,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 17  2016,7.1,LOTS of construction on the building made initial entrance difficult. (Check in instruction rendered worthless by construction. Had to make entrance on opposite side of building on a different street a block away. Pressed buzzer several times before being let in. ) The appliances were dirty (coffee pot. toaster. microwave.) Part of coffee pot was missing. Master bedroom window would not close all the way ( thank God it wasn't raining but nighttime city noise was distracting with window not fully closed. ) Also. parking was tight in the garage. Spots should be assigned based on vehicle size. I have a large SUV but was given a compact spot while better. larger spots were unoccupied during my stay. I advised the desk clerk about the coffee pot and window when I left but she did not seem interested. (Didn't write issues down. didn't write down my room number. didn't apologize. Just. "ok."),I did like separate bedrooms. the view. the balcony. and the furniture.

Once I open the door. i cannot step into the bath tub - have to open the door. glide into the small space next to the toilet. close the door. and then able to step into the bath tub...,Just fyi. it is a very traditional hotel. Mostly elderly people as far as I can see. Whether you'll like it really depends on what your style is.

Hotel Commonwealth,Boston,United States of America,6 Reviews,October 21  2017,9.2,We like nice breakfasts. and while the breakfast at Evening Standard in the hotel was fine. by day 2 we were ready for a change but because of the hotel location there was no other nice alternative for breakfast close by. Also there is no in-room coffee maker or coffee and tea available in the lobby. Although the hotel has free wifi. the free version is only up to 1MB speed. while the higher speed is $19.99/day. The free version is fine for web browsing but was not adequate when we tried streaming a movie from Amazon or Netflix. We ended up using the personal hotspot on my iPhone to watch the movie...,The Junior suite was very spacious and comfortable and we were thrilled that the housekeeping made up the room very early each day while we were at breakfast. We liked that there were two good restaurants at the hotel. and a Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts within the block. There is an entrance to the Kenmore Green Line T station in the same block as the hotel. We had beautiful weather and walked to the Convention Center. Newbury Street shops and across the bridge to MIT in Cambridge.
Hotel Commonwealth,Darin Engelhardt,United States of America,1 review,October 10  2017,6.7,I have stayed at the Hotel Commonwealth numerous times. and every prior experience I would rate 10 in every category.  Not this time.  I confirmed a king bed room in the booking.com reservation.  Hotel provided two queens - they explained that although the booking.com reservation confirmed a king bed. since the reservation was not made through the hotel site they could not honor the king bed reservation.  Either the booking.com site did not explain this possibility. or I did not see it on the booking.com site. The room was also below the standard of quality I have experienced every other time at the hotel.  The gentleman at the desk was not particularly professional in his interactions with me. both with his explanation and his demeanor at check in.  I need to emphasize that every other time I have stayed at the hotel. I have thought the staff and the hotel were truly phenomenal.  I have also previously had only positive experiences with booking.com.  The savings on the room for this trip were not worth the tradeoff in bed and room quality.,N/A

Hotel Commonwealth,Mary,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 27  2017,9.2,The veiw! Our room faced a wall and parking garage. Never had this kind of view at this hotel before.

The room was very comfortable and clean.
Hotel Commonwealth,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 26  2017,9.6,The bar.,Staff was great. Restaurants are independently operated - very good. The bar was a huge disappointment. It is also independently operated and it is small. The door person profiled potential patrons...she was selecting a specific kind of crowd. Hotel patrons had no benefit in getting in for the final evening nightcap.
Hotel Commonwealth,Nicole,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 24  2017,9.2,Bed was less comfy than the hotel I stayed at in Minneapolis last week for a conference.,Location can't be beat - most rooms look right at Fenway Park and one of the elevators is decorated like a giant baseball and the wall signed by former players.
Hotel Commonwealth,Ca,United States of America,1 review,September 21  2017,9.2,The restaurant wasn't good at all.  We attempted to have dinner once but. the menu wasn't accommodating and it was very loud.  We did go for breakfast and again the music was very loud.  I ordered the French toast and less than 5 minutes later it arrived. COLD!  The portions we small and it was overly priced for what I received.  The staff was nice but. the food. price. and loudness was not good.,Everything was really nice and the staff was friendly.  The décor really captured the Red Sox!  It was very clean and easy to navigate.
Hotel Commonwealth,Thomas,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 17  2017,10,N/A,We liked everything about the hotel.  We were going to see the Red Sox. so the location was excellent - just three blocks away.  The first impression of the hotel was the staff - who were all wonderful.  Very friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived to the door closed on the cab when we left.  The hotel lobby was a comfortable place to relax or wait for friends.The room was large. clean and comfortable.  The bathroom was clean and the shower was powerful and the hot water plentiful.There are two very good restaurants that are attached or accessible through the hotel and we would highly recommend both.In summary. stay here. you'll be happy with your choice.
Hotel Commonwealth,St,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 11  2017,9.2,It was expensive but close to what we wanted to see and very easy to get to public transportation.,The hotel was just steps away from the subway.  We took the Silver Line from the airport and realized that the trip from the airport to the hotel was actually FREE.  One day we walked from Boston Commons to the hotel.  It was long but a fun walk.  So close to Fenway that we went to the baseball game twice.  Desk clerk was friendly and nice.  Eastern Standard had a great breakfast.
Hotel Commonwealth,Richard,Ireland,2 Reviews,September 9  2017,10,There wasn't a coffee maker in the room.  You could get one. but you had to request it.  And also then request the coffee to be regularly stocked up.  For the quality of the hotel. it just seemed strange that such a basic feature was missing.  There is a dunkin donuts and Starbucks right next door. but there should still be a coffee maker in every room as a default.,Staff were friendly. the location was perfect for baseball as Fenway is just round the corner.  Kenmore subway station is right next door meaning you can get anywhere in the city very easily.  The hotel has a baseball theme running through it. so a great hotel for baseball fans.  Rooms were spacious and very clean. perfect really.
Hotel Commonwealth,Lisa,United States of America,7 Reviews,September 8  2017,8.8,Our experience unfortunately was marred by the front desk person's telling us that the check in time was not 3 PM but rather 4 PM; she claimed that the hotel's website had not yet been updated to reflect this. She then tried to put us in a room for more money if we wanted to check in at 3 PM. Finally. fortunately. she did  find a room for us at 3 PM and it was a little better than the one we had originally booked. But to go through that hassle in the beginning did not get our visit off to a good start. The parking fee per night seemed  inordinately high. Also. the hotel offered one bottle of water in the room and it was for $6.,The proximity to Fenway Park was this property's biggest asset. Also. the rooms were extremely well appointed and comfortable; creative in the baseball-stitched curtains. The amenities were also top notch.  Other than the experience with the front desk noted separately. the staff were all very friendly and helpful.

Hotel Commonwealth,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 18  2017,6.7,Transportation to the airport is horrible.  Bathroom was in disrepair (sink drain didn't close. and faucet leaked onto the top of vanity. no exhaust fan in the bathroom).  Had to carry my own luggage from taxi to the lobby.  After three conversations with front desk. they did finally reduce my room rate.,Good location to Fenway Park.  The bed was good.

Hotel Commonwealth,Jeanne O'K,United States of America,1 review,August 14  2017,9.6,We were assuming that it would be convenient having on premises restaurants.

Hotel Commonwealth,Elaine,United States of America,1 review,August 6  2017,8.3,I had to ask for things such as an electric kettle or a coffee maker. Room did not have a hair dryer. but probably you had to ask for it. The rooms were really empty of the usual amenities. but they were supplied if you asked. The problem is that some of the people did not know they could just ask for what they needed.,Rooms were beautiful and clean. Staff was terrific!
Hotel Commonwealth,Kelli,United States of America,4 Reviews,August 5  2017,10,Having to unload our car at the curb/in the street and only having valet parking as a possibility. Otherwise. everything was great!,Everyone was friendly and the hotel was very convenient to the Train station and buses. Starbucks next door too.

Hotel Commonwealth,united man,United States of America,1 review,August 1  2017,9.6,The shower heads in our suite were a bit too powerful but that's all.,The room was great and the staff was very helpful! The hotel is located in a perfect spot in Boston. Right near Fenway park. It's great if planning an outing to a Red Sox game.
Hotel Commonwealth,Christine,United States of America,1 review,July 31  2017,9.6,Hotel garage parking for hotel guests is $53/ nightly.,The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly.

Hotel Commonwealth,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 29  2017,5.0,We were given very noisy rm next to the freeway. Pillows n bed very uncomfortable. Shower water controller slipped to HOT water all the time. Charged us $50 worth of taxes PER DAY. Won't return.,Proximity to Boston U.
Hotel Commonwealth,Eduardo,United States of America,1 review,July 27  2017,8.8,The day we left. noted various increased charges for the room rate. Apparently. they charge MORE based on the capacity of the hotel which was never communicated to us- so quite an unpleasant surprise! Also. no way for us to verify "capacity" of guests to know if this was true.Would have been nice to have a "hotel discount" from the adjacent restaurants as breakfast was not included with the room.,So nice that it was located next to the T. Thoughtful that they provided an umbrella as it rained when we were there. Very clean and modern. Two great restaurants connected to the hotel. Staff very friendly. Fresh ice water with fruits at the front desk.
Hotel Commonwealth,Wendy G,United States of America,4 Reviews,July 27  2017,6.7,For $400 plus a night. we expected perks like a coffee station in the room. bath robes. and little toiletries like a disposable shower cap. We ordered a pot of coffee for $25 and while it came quickly. it was honestly the WORST coffee we've ever tasted. Location was convenient but also had homeless people hanging out and even sleeping all night just across from the main entrance. The view of the stadium was dominated by an abandoned industrial sight and multi lane highway that was NOISY and not an upgrade as the Booking.com app made it seem.,We loved the modern updated bathroom!
Hotel Commonwealth,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 26  2017,10,Problem with the Booking.com reservation -- it was under guest's name. so appeared non-existent when we were checking in.  Hotel staff compensated.,N/A
Hotel Commonwealth,Linda,United States of America,1 review,July 26  2017,7.1,No coffee. Fire alarm went off Monday early AM requesting an evacuation. Then a five minute automated "all clear" alarm. Went to check out and none of the staff acknowledge the alarm. didn't offer an apology or anything. Very rude awakening on a Monday morning. A lot of people were upset and the staff just simply ignored the issue. No morning coffee or paper. which isn't a good sign of basic hospitality.,Stayed in new section of hotel. Was a great room with a great view. Clean and modern. AC worked wonders in the Boston heat and humidity.
Hotel Commonwealth,Chih-wei,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 25  2017,9.6,N/A,Location is great. Keith at front desk was the most helpful that I have seen. Overall a great experience at Boston and it all started with Hotel Commonwealth.

Hotel Commonwealth,Candace,United States of America,13 Reviews,July 20  2017,8.3,For the first time I felt very challenged by the hotel entry way.  I currently have a knee injury. and found it transition from door to lobby awkward with stairs and location of the elevator.  As for the rooms. I actually preferred the old decor as it made the room feel more cozy. and I missed the in-room coffee amenity.,Loved the location. comfortable bed. and seafood restaurant. Staff very helpful.
Hotel Commonwealth,Asian,United States of America,1 review,July 14  2017,8.8,The free WiFi was very slow - only around 150 MB/s. Most equivalent hotels in places where I travel to frequently in Asia or Europe provide much faster complimentary WiFi. Even a developing country like Sri Lanka.,N/A

Hotel Commonwealth,Eastcoastour,United States of America,1 review,July 10  2017,10,N/A,My son and I were on a college tour. We stayed at the Commonwealth Hotel and toured Boston University and Boston College. It was an amazing experience. The hotel was more than I could've asked for. We were very pleased with our accommodations.
Hotel Commonwealth,Laura,United States of America,1 review,July 10  2017,7.1,I didn't think the room was worth the price.  With taxes and valet fee. it was over $500.  For that price. I want perfection.  Bathroom tub floor was peeling. didn't seem that clean to me.  Beds were so/so. not super comfortable.  Towels in bathroom felt like sandpaper when drying off.,Property was perfectly located to where we were going (Fenway).  Staff was very helpful and very pleasant.  Room was clean and view of Fenway was cool.
Hotel Commonwealth,Jillian,United States of America,1 review,July 9  2017,10,N/A,Nick at the front desk took EXCELLENT care of my girlfriends and I. who were staying there for a birthday and bachelorette party. He went above and beyond to make sure our trip was memorable and fun. It's the little things that take a hotel from 'good' to 'amazing' and the staff here certainly has the service part down. Thank you to the entire staff at Hotel Commwealth and especially to Nick for being the best ever.
Hotel Commonwealth,Monica,Venezuela,30 Reviews,July 7  2017,10,The only way yo park is using valet services. A bit expensive. But all paekings in Boston are,Beds ate very confortable. I wish i could have more time. Execellent location and restaurants
Hotel Commonwealth,Evan,United States of America,1 review,July 6  2017,9.2,The smell of fish in the lobby was overpowering.  We had to hold our breath when walking from the elevator.  Gross! Need ventilation help! We did not notice this last time we stayed there.  Also we did not like the shower head.  Even my wife at 5' 7" had to duck to wash her hair.  And. the pressure was uncomfortable. prickly feeling. and there was no way to change it.  We prefer a rain shower.,The location is great.  Also we like the style. it's modern without being in-your-face modern.  The  service is always great. front desk and in room dining.
Hotel Commonwealth,Melissa,United States of America,1 review,July 4  2017,7.5,Valet Parking Prices. No Self parking garage. Wifi too slow.,Good bed and pillows.

Hotel Commonwealth,April,United States of America,1 review,June 26  2017,10,We had no issues during our stay.,This hotel is truly amazing. It's down the street from Fenway Park and is surrounded by beautiful buildings/scenery. My family (2 adults + 2 teenage boys) arrived earlier than our designated check-in time and were upgraded to a junior suite so that we could drop off our luggage before our Fenway tour/ RedSox game. The room was so clean. comfortable. and beautiful. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating throughout our stay and we can't wait to return.
Hotel Commonwealth,Paula,United States of America,1 review,June 20  2017,7.5,Dirty bed,The comforter in the room was dirty.  This was not a good situation as we paid a good amount to stay in this hotel.  It had make up and mascara all over it as if someone had laid down on the bed. I was going to ask for some money back on the stay.
Hotel Commonwealth,Suzanne,United States of America,4 Reviews,June 14  2017,10,When entering the hotel. it was very bland and non-description...just a set of stairs.,It was such a lovely hotel. and the Hawthorne and Eastern Standard were great!
Hotel Commonwealth,Tim,Canada,8 Reviews,June 8  2017,9.2,Bathtub drained very slow was the only problem.,We had a very pleasant stay at the Boston Hotel Commonwealth during our visit.The hotel was exceptionally very clean and comfortable.  The hotel location near the cafes. bars. restaurants and transit station made our visit to beautiful Boston very convenient.The hotel’s Front Desk staff plus the bell hops were all very polite.
Hotel Commonwealth,Kenneth,United States of America,4 Reviews,June 7  2017,9.6,It felt like the air was on constantly and not controlled by the thermostat. They had to cover a vent to prevent it from coming out but the noise kept me up most of the night.  Also some weird noises coming from the refrigerator.,The room was very spacious with separate sitting room.  We faced the street but could not hear any street noise.  The restaurants attached to the hotel are both superior.  Especially Island Creek Oyster Bar.  Excellent food and drinks!
Hotel Commonwealth,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,June 5  2017,9.6,Everything was great except for an unusual foul odor in the lobby between the front desk and elevator.  Smelled like rotting fish.,Location.  Proximity to Fenway.  Proximity to public transit.  Ease to get to airport.Rooms very clean and plenty of space.  Room overlooked Commonwealth Ave. but did not hear any street noise---well built windows!!  Quick work by Valet to get car every time.I would not hesitate to stay at hotel again on return trip to Boston.
Hotel Commonwealth,Amy,Cambodia,4 Reviews,May 30  2017,10,Both my son and I experienced our in room breakfast not being served on time.  And we have to call to get it delivered.  Both was resolved very quickly.  Not a reflection of the hotel since I believe it is being executed by one of the restaurants on the premise.  We prefer strong European style coffee and the coffee served was fine. but not strong enough for us.  But that is a personal preference.,The staffs are all excellent! Professional and kind and very efficient in responding to any issues. The restaurants on the property are both fantastic.
Hotel Commonwealth,Richard,United States of America,1 review,May 30  2017,9.2,N/A,Executive king suite was perfect for traveling with  our 23 year old daughter. We had a rollaway bed in the large sitting area and she essentially had her own room.
Hotel Commonwealth,David,United States of America,4 Reviews,May 29  2017,10,N/A,Bathroom and the rest of the room was big.  Many Boston Hotels squeeze you into a sardine can.  Not the Commonwealth.  We watched a Red Sox game and walked back to our hotel and had a drink within 5 mintues.
Hotel Commonwealth,UVA Alicia,United States of America,3 Reviews,May 28  2017,8.8,Blonde female conscierge who was abrupt when I asked for additional water to be sent to my room. She states "it should already be up there". Which it was. but had already drank it. which is why I requested more. Snooty attitude was not appreciated nor appropriate. We stay here often and have never been given "attitude" before when requesting something as simple as water. However the other concierges were quite pleasant and easy to deal with.,Room amenities and early check-in
Hotel Commonwealth,Mike,United States of America,1 review,May 7  2017,10,shower head seemed crappy compared to the excellence of the rest of the hotel and staff- was surprised it didn't have a better spray pattern.  Not bad enough to complain about. just being honest.,N/A
Hotel Commonwealth,Ks1543,United States of America,1 review,May 3  2017,10,Nothing - great hotel!,The bed was comfortable and the room decor was great.  The room service was also very good.  There are 2 great restaurants attached to the hotel and it is blocks away from Fenway.
Hotel Commonwealth,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,May 3  2017,9.6,The Eastern Standard and Island Creek Oyster Bar have some of the worst staffing. not all but just a few. We sat and watched good people get turned away or refused to be served after they were served. People like Nick Moreland at the Eastern Standard shouldn't be placed in the the position he's in we spent four days there and only ate there once after seeing him being very unprofessional. We spoke with the others staying at the hotel an they had seen or been  the victim of his behavior. As far as the oyster bar goes it was just as unprofessional as well. We got up and left before we even ordered. They really need to hired mature people for the position of being the first point of contact for there business. Not people with their own agenda to look important in front of other employees. When I returned home I immediately paid more attention to my greeters and other first points of contact of my business and thanked God I didn't  have employees as rude as these to businesses.,We loved the location it's a perfect setting for any baseball fan. Staff was excellent. very friendly and helpful. They made the stay worth it. Rooms were very  comfortable.
Hotel Commonwealth,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,May 2  2017,9.2,Handle on sliding bathroom door.... poor design as I pinched my fingers quite hard between the handle and the door casing as I guess I should have let go before the door was fully closed,Excellent location as we attended a game at Fenway. Room was available for an early check in on Sunday and we had a view of Fenway Park itself.
Hotel Commonwealth,Brian,United States of America,1 review,May 2  2017,7.1,The room was noisy from expressway traffic. There was no mini bar.

The bartender in the oyster restaurant was extremely rude!,Eastern standard was very good
Hotel Commonwealth,Daniel,United States of America,1 review,April 27  2017,6.7,We booked a room with a view of fenway and when we got their they said they upgraded us to another room. That room did not have a view of fenway. Also. the water on the shower was either scalding hot or cold. Lastly. our breakfast was not cooked all the way. For the amount of $700 for one night this was a huge disappointment,That is was close to Fenway ballpark
Hotel Commonwealth,Anonymous,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,April 27  2017,6.7,Wifi is extra if you need a decently fast connection. The room could use sound-proofing. as it is overlooking the highway. Also. a lot of noise emits from the hallway of the hotel - loud noises of people closing their doors etc. Gym was very outdated. No mini bar in the room. water bottles were not replaced. No coffee machine in the room. Front desk staff was not overly helpful or polite. Same with the bell desk - they don't even bother to open the door most of the time nor offer help with taxis/luggage etc.,Good location. well-sized room. Comfortable bed. Nice bathroom layout.
Hotel Commonwealth,Lynne,United States of America,1 review,April 25  2017,10,The view was not the best. but we were not visiting to stay in the room so it was not really an issue.  Would have liked a Keurig coffee maker in the room.,The room was very large and spacious and the Queen beds were very comfortable.  The bathroom was also very large and spacious and the shower head was heavenly!
Hotel Commonwealth,Lisandra,Puerto Rico,1 review,April 24  2017,8.8,Latte although very hot (how I really like) definitely needs to be stronger. Tasted like milk instead of coffee and was expensive.  :-(,Good location and great staff attention.Cozy hotel.
Hotel Commonwealth,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,April 20  2017,9.6,Were told there would be a light breakfast (bagels. juice. coffee) the day of the Marathon.

Eastern Standard restaurant was FABULOUS.
Hotel Commonwealth,Mike,United Kingdom,19 Reviews,April 20  2017,9.2,Poor vegetarian choice in restaurant and not labeled vegetarian.

Hotel Commonwealth,Michele,United States of America,1 review,April 20  2017,9.2,N/A,The staff was very helpful and friendly. The rooms were very comfortable and clean.  I loved the location in Boston; we were visiting colleges with my sons.  We were a block walking to Fenway and BU.  The hotel is next to a subway stop and we took and easy ride to the Celtic's game. There was 711. Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks right next the Hotel. making it convenient to grab drinks. snack or coffee.
Hotel Commonwealth,Wade,Canada,1 review,April 19  2017,9.6,One small gripe was that modern-style shower was a little finicky -- it was tough to find the right temperature.

The beds were excellent.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 28  2017,10,They really didn't have the internet as accessible as I liked. I really wanted fresh coffee but received no accommodations and had ordered it in the morning never got it.,Nice room. And clean. Friendly staff
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 22  2017,5.4,No free Wifi. You gotta be a reward member to have access to wifi for free.

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Molly,United States of America,1 review,October 18  2017,7.1,The business center was extremely sparse...no pens. no ability to fax.

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Margaret,Canada,1 review,October 16  2017,9.6,The parking wasn't included in the booking and was very expensive at $48 per night.We didn't try breakfast as again it wasn't included and for $25 we could eat somewhere different with a range of menu items.,Very convenient location steps away from Fisherman's wharf.The beds were superbly comfortable but too high off the ground for shorter individuals.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Cortland,United States of America,1 review,September 28  2017,2.9,I ended up sleeping on a big cot in a hospitality room because my room was given away and the rooms had roaches... as well as being woken up too early by housekeeping the next morning!,Nothing
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Marcelo,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,September 21  2017,9.6,Fairly standard look of a big chain. don't expect a memorable experience.,Quick 20 minute taxi from airport. very convenient for the ferry and access to lots of new restaurants and bars. Also walkable to downtown Boston ~ 25min. Decent size gym facilities and big lobby bar for drinks.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 7  2017,9.2,Wifi was not free. Was not allowed to bring outside alcohol into the hotel. Jacuzzi was broken so we were unable to get in. Staff didn't seem like they new what they were doing 100% of the time.,Clean and updated room. Great view. Within walking distance from restaurants and activities. Close enough to the city.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Randi,Canada,1 review,September 3  2017,2.9,Booking.com did a terrible of conveying what this property is like. Parking is $48 not $44 as you promised under guest details and the manager argued with me about it. claiming you're a third party website so the hotel has no obligation to honour anything you say. Booking.com gave me no option to use reward points fromMarriott. This hotel is very far from downtown. It's huge and impersonal with substandard service. The plugs in the room were loose. the water temperature design is backward. the pillows were hard. and all morning starting at 5am there were planes roaring overhead from the nearby airport. one after the other. I didn't notice I had booked a non refundable reservation on booking.com and I'll never make that mistake again. Better to book through hotel websites.,Starbucks in the building.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Kristina,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 29  2017,9.6,More time in Boston,Location great...near some wonderful restaurants.  Near the cruise terminal...walkable if few bags...easy quick ride on Uber or taxi.   We used Uber to get into the main area of Boston tourist land.   Too far to walk when time is of the essence.   Room was great  lovely view.  Starbucks on property. Did not use the hotel facilities...but clearly popular for weddings and parties.  NOT noisy though.   Expensive but so are other Boston hotels.

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Maryjo,United States of America,1 review,July 22  2017,9.2,It did say on our reservation that there was a complimentary breakfast and we didn't get it. The person at desk said it was because we didn't make reservation with hotel! There were 2 weddings that weekend so that probably added to the problem. There would have been an hour wait if we wanted to pay for the breakfast. so we just went somewhere else. Wasn't enough of a problem to mar our good time!,The room was beautiful! The bed was very comfortable!  Enjoyed the bar with its excellent drinks and delicious appetizers.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Raymind,United States of America,1 review,July 10  2017,10,The view could have been more appealing.

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Carrie,United States of America,1 review,June 12  2017,6.7,Very expensive. For the amount you pay for the room. parking and breakfast should be complimentary. It wasn't worth the 350.00 a night I paid. We didn't even get our room cleaned because thy came so late in the morning it was already my 2 year olds nap time. They didn't try to clean it until noon. we left all morning. they had plenty of time to clean it.    The pool was sooo small and it was freezing. although indoors.,N/A
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Paula,United States of America,1 review,May 31  2017,10,N/A,The hotel is close to the transit system. making it super easy to get there from the airport.  The room was extremely comfortable.  There was a Starbucks in the lobby - yeah!
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Susan,Jersey,3 Reviews,May 30  2017,7.1,It was a very long walk to the hub. for us we would have been better in a more central location.,Very Convenient for the airport and railway station. Also for the world trades centre and convention centre. Silverline trams run for free from the airport to right outside the property. There were good restaurants near by.

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Stuart,Australia,2 Reviews,April 17  2017,7.9,N/A,It is close (i.e. next to) some excellent restaurants (such as Legal Seafood). It is also a convenient location to reach the downtown area. A good business class hotel.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Jeanne,United States of America,1 review,April 8  2017,7.5,No activity going on there. Hot tub pool and saunas did not work.  Problems at the start with refrigerator in the room it did not work. Had to get it fixed. Ice machine on our floor was not working. Had to get that fixed. Key cards did not work easily. Had to change out and still took several times to open the door.  Should at least have some comp water and coffee In the lobby. This was a pricey place and amenities were not up to par.,Beautiful place.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Jonathan,United States of America,1 review,February 27  2017,9.2,We received two noise complaints for a loud TV. We are musicians and somewhat hard of hearing because of it. Sorry but. security was not necessary.-Cheers!,We asked for a cardboard cutout of Ziggy Stardust to keep us company in our room during our stay.It was obviously an unreasonable request but. on our last day the staff slipped a thank-you note under the door with David Bowie prominently displayed. It was beautiful.Thank you.-LEIKO
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Charles,Ireland,2 Reviews,February 25  2017,10,The Internet  should be free in rooms to all guests and not at the price that was asked for . After all it is a great hotel and the staying  prices show that . but a major  let down to have to pay more for Internet  access  in rooms .,Staff when out of they way to help .
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Andrew,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,February 1  2017,7.9,Didn't enjoy paying $4 for water bottles left in my room.  Assumed they were complimentary so it wasn't a pleasant surprise when I got my bill at the end of my three weeks' stay. I found the bar a little draughty as well. The itemised charging for laundry e.g. $3 for a single pair of socks forced me to go external for my laundry.,Breakfast was always enjoyable. good food and good. friendly service and with gluten free toast! Friendly and informative service at the bar in the evenings as well with the NFL play-off games on screen. The Business Centre was useful on a couple of occasions. Always good to have an ironing board and iron in the room. My bed was very comfortable. The WiFi was reliable.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,C,United States of America,3 Reviews,January 16  2017,9.6,Parking is $,Staff was friendly. helpful and available to help. Sapore the restaurant was really good.

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,John,United States of America,1 review,January 2  2017,9.6,The lobby bar should have opened sooner than 5:30 pm on New Years Eve as people were checking in at 3 pm and rooms were not ready so people were told to wait in the lobby bar which was closed,Staff were super friendly and helpful

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Lisa,United States of America,1 review,January 1  2017,10,I called twice a few days before check-in to ask about possibly checking in an hour early. The staff who answered the phone was quick to answer my question but also just as quick to hang up the phone before asking me if I had any other questions.,The front desk staff was very friendly and informative. The room was very clean and comfortable.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Sarah,United States of America,1 review,December 24  2016,10,N/A,The location is perfect. close to both the airport and downtown. Room is very spacious and clean. They have really comfy bed as well. Very friendly front desk. Perfect experience!
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Katherine,United States of America,2 Reviews,November 24  2016,7.5,They charge for the water in the room (very deceiving) and the Internet. The bathroom was clean...but the bathtub looked old.,The location was great; front desk staff was friendly enough. nothing memorable. The front desk agent I dealt with during check out was much more cheerful and inviting than the agent I dealt with when I arrived. There was a Starbucks right downstairs and I loved the texting feature to get your car ready when you valet. The room was a good size and was up to date.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Maria,Portugal,3 Reviews,October 1  2016,9.6,It's an expensive hotel... but the price seems to be the normal for Boston.,The location is excellent if you are going to the Boston Convention Center. just a five minutes walk. The room is really comfortable. You can get to the airport in 10-15 minutes.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Kelly,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 28  2016,7.5,Our refrigerator did not work.

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,georginamg,Netherlands,69 Reviews,September 11  2016,9.2,really good,great hotel. room had everything needed to work comfortably. I booked it instead of other hotels in the area because of the swimming pool - a real bonus!
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Jillian,United Kingdom,1 review,September 7  2016,6.7,Internet access in rooms for $12.75 a day is a blatant rip off. Why do some hotel chains think this is ok? - others pride themselves on free internet (e.g. Radisson). The hotel pay for wifi regardless of the number of guests who use it.,Good location for the airport and good facilities. except rip-off wifi.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Walter,United States of America,1 review,September 6  2016,2.9,The room they gave us had doors that didn't lock and we were late for our dinner reservation because they gave no urgency to fixing the issue. The telephones in our room weren't hooked up. so we had to keep going down to the front desk to ask for updates. The staff was unhelpful and acted like we were asking for too much when we reported the unlocked door issue. They moved us to another room where shower door didn't have any sort of lining under it to prevent water from leaking all over the bathroom floor. We had to use all of the towels to dry the floor each day. This was all after my initial booking. where they charged us three times in different amounts. and had to reverse some of the charges. My credit card company actually disabled my card afterwards because they thought it was fraudulent activity. Nothing went right from booking all the way through checkout. Poor staff service. confused finance department. and I don't think the building/rooms were well constructed. Too many issues for a short stay. Will not be back.,The location isn't bad. but mostly everything else went wrong.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Domanica,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 4  2016,9.6,N/A,The staff at the desk were very pleasant attentive to needs when checking in and out.directions.tour information and restaurants in the area.I would definitely come back.Thanks Mike and Joe.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Jessica,Canada,11 Reviews,August 31  2016,8.3,Was told free wifi but stuck with the charge after I get home and check credit card. Was ripped off by conceigure desk. Be careful what you are buying or paying for.,Beautiful hotel and Starbucks located downstairs. Check in lady at front desk was super nice and gave a very positive and welcoming  feeling. I think her name was Emily.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Cassandra,United States of America,1 review,August 17  2016,10,There was a limited choices of what to eat for lunch and dinner at the hotel if you didn't like seafood. that being said there were plenty of close restaurants.,It was a central location with a beautiful view of the harbor.  Also the rooms were beautiful with some good choices in decor to make you feel comfortable.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Kevin,United States of America,1 review,August 15  2016,10,There really wasn't anything. Great location near all the restaurants and Sapore was great.

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Patrick,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 14  2016,5.8,Bed sheets were not fresh. Very disappointing. And we had no view of the city. as I had requested a room on the highest level possible,The location at the seaport
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Anonymous,Italy,5 Reviews,August 12  2016,8.3,I had to join the Marriot Club to get free wifi.  Today wifi should be free to all guests.  There is no excuse to charge for wifi.  Parking in Boston is a total rip-off.  There must be a way for the hotel to negotiate better prices for its guests.,Location was perfect for our needs and staff were extremely friendly.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Samantha,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 31  2016,6.7,We were low on time for an event in Boston. The check in line was very long. between 5-8 you should have more staff out front. Also the water pressure was super low and valet took more than 20 minutes with no benches out front.,Location
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Jeff,United States of America,4 Reviews,June 23  2016,7.5,I never liked any of the music playing in the foyer or bar area and it was everywhere. If you wanted to place a cell call you had to go outside. Also. there was an exit door near the bar that would sound an alarm everytime someone went out the door when the bar was open. Totally destroying any atmosphere.,Breakfast menu was very good.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Deborah,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 23  2016,7.9,We would have liked to have a safe in the room and refrigerator snacks etc.,The location was super and very exciting to see the development of that area of Boston.The staff was very friendly.

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Erin,United States of America,3 Reviews,May 31  2016,7.5,Found it odd that you're not allowed to bring in outside beer or wine - just wanted to relax in my room with a couple of beers but was told I could not bring them into the hotel. Would not stay here again because of that. Maybe a zoning law or something (i.e. not the fault of the hotel) - but is a deal breaker.,Location is excellent.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Kate_NYC,United States of America,11 Reviews,May 25  2016,6.7,The beds were very narrow. they didn't even seem to be a full size double bed. Pool was nice to have but could use a little sprucing up. The location is good if you're spending a lot of time in the seaport area. but otherwise it's a bit of a walk to downtown Boston.,Very close to my conference at the Seaport World Trade Center.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,May 24  2016,6.7,I was pretty disappointed with our room. The view from our room and the room itself was nothing special considering how much I paid for a one-night stay.,N/A

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,David,United States of America,1 review,April 26  2016,9.2,I called for sheets for the bed in the pull out couch. The woman on the phone asked specifically if I needed the fitted sheet for the bed then there was no fitted sheet delivered to the room. Housekeeping staff continued to make the bed that way never adding a fitted sheet.,The staff at the front desk was fantastic. I was paying in cash for the weekend and it took almost the whole team to put their heads together and figure it out but we figured it all out and they were pleasant and courteous the entire time. It was a great experience.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,William,Canada,5 Reviews,April 23  2016,8.8,High cost relative to other similar hotels that we have stayed in. This was because of the Boston Maraton weekend and all prices were high. No free wi fi in rooms. $18.00 per day is outrageous.,Beds were very comfortable wth nicely furnished. spacious and clean rooms Nice views from hotel room window and short walk to historic area. Friendly and helpful staff. Close to the airport with a free shuttle.

Loews Boston Hotel,Stacey,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 31  2017,10,The room was a little small and only offered double beds in a two bed room. which is small for people who are used to sleeping in larger beds but were still comfortable.,Loved the friendliness of the staff at the front desk. on the phone. and at the door.  The rooms were nicely decorated and the beds were comfortable.  Bathrooms were large and well appointed.  Location of hotel is great and central to all parts of Boston and a little over a mile away from Northeastern University (where our son attends).  We were able to walk everywhere but there is a taxi stand just at the corner so didn't have to go far to get a ride if necessary.  My husband liked their bar downstairs for drinks and watching the World Series (2017).
Loews Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 31  2017,9.2,No room service all night but other than that is was fine .,The service for breakfast was slow but we managed .

Loews Boston Hotel,Rob,Netherlands,6 Reviews,October 30  2017,7.9,Stairs when entering the lobby is not very conveniently if traveling with suitcases. Staff was not extremely friendly.

Loews Boston Hotel,Kate,United Kingdom,12 Reviews,October 24  2017,9.6,Nothing!,Family friendly hotel with comfortable clean and spacious rooms - we loved the bathroom sensor light that allowed a trip to the bathroom after dark without waking everybody else up! Great location and the Precinct bar and restaurant drew guests from outside the hotel so the atmosphere was buzzy not to mention great cocktails and food.

Loews Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,10 Reviews,October 11  2017,7.5,The room was very small.  The bathroom was very small.  The water pressure in the shower was very low (give yourself several minutes to get shampoo out of your hair).  There are only 2 elevators. so at rush hour it's difficult to get to the lobby.  And I was charged $8 for one bottle of water that I didn't even drink.  Who on Earth would pay $8 for a bottle of Voss?,Staff was extremely nice and accommodative

Loews Boston Hotel,Frances,New Zealand,13 Reviews,October 1  2017,10,It would have been helpful to have an electric jug as well as the coffee maker in the room as sometimes some boiling water is useful,The restaurant was great...very flexible for a late night bite or quick breakfast. The staff were most helpful and very approachable and pleasant. Easy for taxis and Uber to find.
Loews Boston Hotel,Sandra,France,4 Reviews,September 29  2017,8.8,You could still hear the traffic in the rooms - better sound insulation in the windows would be good.   Large trucks drive through Boston from quite early in the morning. and rather noisy.   Husband slightly deaf. so did not hear them!   Always an issue with city hotels though.... and I did manage to ignore that a little by day 3.Poor availability to good tourist information. everyone just dipped in and gave conflicting advice on how to travel around the city etc.    We can't have been the only guests in Boston for the first time...    they could offer a map. but little else.Not generous with coffee in the room. allocation was 2 capsules a day....No international news channels screened?  Certainly could not find one. having scrolled through.  No list of channels in the room. and no information on which services were free and which films etc you would be charged for.,Liked the super-comfy king bed.  After a flight in from London it was a sheer delight to sink into it!Loved the cappuccino that was available in the small lounge. and it was free.ğŸ˜‹We had an issue with the shower in our room. and hotel reacted immediately by upgrading us to a corner room. with a fully functional shower - thank you.
Loews Boston Hotel,Stephen,United Kingdom,10 Reviews,September 29  2017,7.5,Rooms open directly to corridor so corridor noise is a factor and a/c units are noisy as they cycle on / off / on,Great Back Bay location and very handy to commuter rail and MBTA
Loews Boston Hotel,Anne,United Kingdom,1 review,September 28  2017,8.8,The room we were allocated initially had a constant droning noise from the air conditioning unit on the roof. which was impossible to sleep through. Staff were very helpful however in moving us to an alternative quieter room the next day.   It would also have been great if a kettle had been provided in our room rather than a coffee making machine (although there was free coffee and tea in the hotel lobby),Staff were very friendly and helpful. Beds very comfortable. Great location for sightseeing.
Loews Boston Hotel,Victoria,United Kingdom,1 review,September 27  2017,9.6,The room view wasn't great but we didn't travel there for fantastic views so no real complaint.,Bed was super comfy and the bathroom was really clean.
Loews Boston Hotel,Diane,Australia,12 Reviews,September 26  2017,10,Nothing that comes to mind.,Beautiful hotel in a great area of Boston. Back Bay. Close to restaurants and shops. Boston is a very walkable city so getting down town was easy. The room. a standard king. was lovely with a very comfortable bed. Staff were helpful and friendly and the facilities excellent.  We ate a number of times at the hotel restaurant. the Precinct. and couldn't fault the food. We enjoyed our time here and wouldn't  hesitate to return to this hotel or recommend it to others.

Loews Boston Hotel,Gerry,United Kingdom,42 Reviews,September 15  2017,9.6,Not much but it is expensive so plan your budget well.,Great hotel. Rooms are spacious. bed comfortable. good location and very helpful staff.

Loews Boston Hotel,Lisa,United States of America,1 review,September 7  2017,6.7,Stayed twice in span of 4 days.First room very small for 2 adults. We were bumping in to each other. Told desk &amp; was upgraded to a larger room for second stay.

Also the bar/ restaurant area lovely.
Loews Boston Hotel,Maria,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,August 24  2017,8.3,There could have been more tourist information available - we asked a few times for maps/walking info and transport info but kept getting directed to phone uber!,The rooms were modern and comfortable. the hotel was lovely and free coffee is always a bonus!!! There is a bar and restaurant attached both of which are worth a visit  - also as the hotel isn't in the centre of Boston you get to see a bit more of the area than you would if it was
Loews Boston Hotel,Andreas,Austria,16 Reviews,August 24  2017,9.6,N/A,This is a chain hotel where you don't have the feeling of staying in a chain hotel. Great service. from cleaning via concierge service to lounge coffee machine. Excellent management

Loews Boston Hotel,Paul,Australia,4 Reviews,August 22  2017,10,N/A,We would like to thank Greg - our waiter - and Heather  -  the Concierge for the excellent efforts to make our stay memorable.  They went above expectations and were fantastic. The other hotels we have stayed in pale into insignificance compared to Loews Boston..We would not hesitate in recommending your hotel to our friends. Sue &amp; Paul Moynihan. Room 642.
Loews Boston Hotel,Emily,United States of America,1 review,August 14  2017,9.2,I wish there was a small cafe with pastries and snacks on the premises.,The beds are comfortable and staff is friendly and helpful! Location is great! Just a couple of blocks from Copley Square and Boston Public Garden. Newbury Street is a few minutes' walk as well. Plenty of places to walk to for sightseeing and food.
Loews Boston Hotel,Caroline,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,August 10  2017,10,Complimentary breakfast. similar to new York hotels. would have been nice.,The room was upgraded due to us getting married and this was wonderful surprise.

Loews Boston Hotel,Daniel,United States of America,14 Reviews,August 9  2017,10,N/A,Our family's experience at the Loews Boston was outstanding.  The staff were very friendly and helpful from the front desk to housekeeping to the valet.  The beds were great and the coffee room/bar was a terrific place to grab an espresso each morning.  This restored police station was an incredibly hospitable place to visit -- look forward to returning!
Loews Boston Hotel,Sarah,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 7  2017,8.8,Valet service/Bell service was not good. Waited when we arrived... I had to go and find someone to valet the car. We called for the car at 10am (check out was 11am) and received an automated message that our car would be ready in 15 minutes. We checked out 10 minutes later and waited outside for our car. Our car arrived at 10:30am... 30 minutes from the time that we called and 15 minutes late. We were told they were backed up because of check out. At $50.00 per night I would have thought the service would have been better.,Great location in the Back Bay area. Very clean and nice room with a very comfortable bed.
Loews Boston Hotel,Garry,Canada,1 review,August 5  2017,10,The bar seems to be a popular after-work spot for young professionals. which makes the ground floor very loud after 4:30 pm.,Great location close to major tourist attractions.  Friendly and helpful staff.  The old police headquarters transformed into a sleek. modern hotel.
Loews Boston Hotel,Shirley,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 3  2017,10,There was nothing that I didn't like.,The location of the hotel was great.  We could walk to all the places (e.g. Boston Gardens. Boston Common. Newbury Street. Boylston Street. Copley Place. etc.) that we wanted to go.  The room was large. very clean and had everything we needed.  We enjoyed the free coffee and tea that was available all day long.  The fitness center offered a workout area. machines and weights which enabled me to workout during my visit.  A great place to stay.  The next time I am in Boston. I will definitely stay there.
Loews Boston Hotel,Eaj,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,August 2  2017,9.6,There really wasn't anything I didn't like other than the first two rooms were noisy ie by the main road and a generator but they moved me to solve that issue.,The staff were extremely accommodating about my request for a quiet room and moved me twice to find a room I was happy with. I also appreciated the tea/coffee station in the lounge area. Then we really was supremely comfortable and the bathroom very well supplied with bits and pieces I needed.
Loews Boston Hotel,Melinda,United States of America,1 review,August 1  2017,7.9,The coffee machine in the lobby area was messed up every morning. First day there was no coffee beans. second day no milk. third day no creamer and fourth day no creamer or milk. We texted and called employees to help out but never seemed to work right. Definitely need someone to maintain that machine. I ended up walking to buy coffee at another hotel's Starbucks.,N/A
Loews Boston Hotel,Bri,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,August 1  2017,7.5,Busy bar crammed with young local office workers after work. loud and off- putting. Ate twice at the restaurant/bar - food is expensive and not very good. Horrible scallops dish. very tired asparagus. Nothing suggests fresh produce. carefully prepared.,Large comfortable guest rooms. Best lighting in a guest room that I have come across. Plenty of well positioned lights making reading a pleasure not a challenge. Coffee machine in room. Free wifi. Quick easy check in and out. Friendly staff. mainly. Great location.
Loews Boston Hotel,Lorna,Australia,6 Reviews,August 1  2017,9.6,Breakfast and dinner in hotel restaurant were both very ordinary. A bit disappointing for a high class hotel.,Excellent location.

Loews Boston Hotel,Redsox,United States of America,1 review,July 24  2017,10,That we had to leave so soon,It was a great property! The 24 hour coffee/espresso/hotchocolate machine was a great surprise!!! The restaurant had the bestwaffles and fish and chips! Everyone was sooooo friendly! We had a roomfor us and a room for our children. they placed us across the hall fromeach other --at the end of the hall -- and we were able to close off ourtwo rooms from the others on the hall. Super secure and superprivate...again. another unexpected surprise.
Loews Boston Hotel,Azita,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,July 24  2017,5.4,I found the hotel pretentious. full of like-to-be's. The valet parking is ridiculous since they park your car somewhere 20 minutes away and you need to book your own car and much more expensive than nearby car parks. The two queen bedroom we had was very small. only the bathroom was rather spaceous. The location was OK.,location
Loews Boston Hotel,Yvonne,Ireland,3 Reviews,July 21  2017,8.8,N/A,Great location within walking distance of Boston Common and bars and restaurants. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Comfortable clean room. nice bathroom. free tea and coffee.
Loews Boston Hotel,Stephen,United States of America,1 review,July 20  2017,7.1,concierge never at stand. Every time we requested directions from doorman they told us to put in address to GPS in our car? Also shower floor dirty and shower door leaked all over floor  with every shower necessitating use of all extra towels. Left housekeeping a note never heard from anyone. Not worth the $. Also requesting adjoining rooms since we traveled withboit teeneage son he was down the hall and arachnid the corner. Hostess staff at orecenit was rude.,Location

Loews Boston Hotel,Kathryn,Australia,11 Reviews,July 17  2017,9.2,Our room was far too small and cramped to be called Deluxe. The bathroom was very small but the worst thing was a tiny vanity with one basin and absolutely minimal bench space. Had to put toiletries in the floor!,The staff were all extremely cheerful and happy to provide extra service. Great coffee available in the lounge in the morning.
YOTEL Boston,Donna,Israel,1 review,October 31  2017,7.9,The soap dispensers in the shower were not filled. There is no place to sit or work other than the bed.,The bed was very comfortable. The design was clever.
YOTEL Boston,Katelyn,United States of America,1 review,October 30  2017,9.6,N/A,The self check-in process was so easy and the staff were so accommodating. Our keys are demagnetized and the manager gave us complimentary cocktails for the inconvenience. I’ve never had a hotel do that. The rooms were very comfortable and I felt at home during my stay.
YOTEL Boston,Robert,United States of America,1 review,October 30  2017,10,We stayed on the night of the Halloween Party so we would could not access the sky lounge without paying. Very disappointing since we were not interested in the Halloween party just having a drink with the view.,The rooms were clean and it was in a great location. Beds were super comfy!
YOTEL Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 28  2017,5.4,Hugely overpriced for a tiny room. Room size essentially inadequate for 2 people. Has the feel of a youth hostel or student accommodation. at the price of a luxury hotel. Gym tiny and poorly equipped - no more than 4 people can train at a time. Breakfast expensive for very average food - try the bakery down the lane. You can definitely do better for your visit to Boston. given the wide variety of hotels on offer.,Clean. decent location for the exhibition centre.
YOTEL Boston,Martin,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,October 28  2017,8.3,N/A,The rooms are small by American standards but fine as compared to European cities. Getting from the airport via the free bus was just so simple. The hotel is right opposite the Courthouse stop.Very clean and comfortable bed.
YOTEL Boston,Jye,Singapore,17 Reviews,October 26  2017,8.8,No desk and chair to use laptop. Sitting on bed to do some emails is not what I use to.,Bed can be adjusted to sit upright. Nice for watching TV. Nice surrounding with places to eat. Train station just next door. Very convenient to get to airport.
YOTEL Boston,Matthew,United States of America,1 review,October 25  2017,9.2,The shower seal was broken making it leak into the bathroom and the tv screen went black and only audio was coming through. However. as soon as I brought it to staffs attention.they had it resolved within 10 minutes.,Bed was very comfortable and the staff was always ready and happy to help.
YOTEL Boston,James,United States of America,1 review,October 24  2017,9.6,I can't think of anything.,The lighting in the room was really fun. I had fun playing with the moving bed. as well. I didn't know the concept of Yotel before I arrived. but was really intrigued by it. Very neat and very smart idea!
YOTEL Boston,Chris,United States of America,1 review,October 23  2017,8.8,The keycard system kept disabling the key so I had to continually get a new key.  Annoying. Also wished the rooftop was open before 5.,Bed was very comfy.  Loved the rooftop.
YOTEL Boston,Ramil,Azerbaijan,12 Reviews,October 22  2017,6.3,Rooms were small. the size of one king bed. Barely can move around. No table to work on.,Great location. but small rooms. I paid $400 for a small room per night. Was crazy. It is so small that you can barely move around the room. Wud be great value for $140-150 per night. not more. It was robbery in the day light.
YOTEL Boston,Bostonbrit,United Kingdom,1 review,October 22  2017,6.7,They have a cool light feature behind the TV. A colour mood wheel. But it would have been nice to have one normal light in the room.,Normally we would have got quite a small room but we ended up in a disabled access room so had more space!
YOTEL Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 17  2017,6.7,Very squashed. Massive lack of privacy in the bathroom for a family. Bright lights in bathroom meant that if turned on during the night everyone woke up.,Good technology.
YOTEL Boston,Tammy,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 16  2017,9.2,N/A,"Cabin" Aka Rooms are different from a normal hotel. It was cute. cozy. and super comfortable.  Not a lot of room. but efficient for a two night stay.  Love the water/ice dispenser outside the room.  And rainhead shower was relaxing after a long day of sightseeing.  Great location on the silver bus line
YOTEL Boston,Robert,Canada,2 Reviews,October 16  2017,5.0,N/A,Valet parking 100.00 2 days crazy.No free coffee in morning .Room very small.Staff cold.Wanted to charge us 30.00 extra because we were 1:30 early.how insulting and cheap.Valet parking staff very nice.
YOTEL Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 12  2017,9.6,See above about first impressions and smaaalllll physical space,The beds were great once we got used to them.  The smallness of the room was offputting at first. but once we got used to that too. everything seemed like it was perfectly engineered for a small space with shelves for coffee. etc.. great hairdryer. comfortable bunk bed.  It was just a big surprise that the rooms were that narrow.  That isn't really really represented very well in the pictures.
YOTEL Boston,Naomi,Belgium,8 Reviews,October 9  2017,9.6,I can imagine the rooms would be annoying to share because they are very small.,The rooms are tiny but brand new and clean. The gym was small but nice and it’s always open. As a female travelling alone I never felt unsafe in the area. even though I went to smoke outside at night a few times. Highly recommended for solo travellers!
YOTEL Boston,Arthur,United States of America,1 review,October 9  2017,7.1,Room was too small.The room was sci-fi sterile with high design using cheap materials.  While the bed was comfortable. there was no chair in the room to sit. and no welcome info on how to use hotel services.The electric lock to my room malfunctioned locking me out of the room and requiring having to go through a security clearance before let back in to the room.The hotel's kitchen is ill-prepared to serve a  decent warm breakfast and should not offer food services.The lobby music is loud and unpleasant.,The staff were all helpful and friendly.
YOTEL Boston,Tomasz,Canada,7 Reviews,October 5  2017,10,N/A,Though some might find the rooms at YOTEL small. it was perfect for us. The bed was incredibly comfortable and could be mechanically adjusted. the rainfall shower was relaxing. and the mood lighting was a nice touch.
YOTEL Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 4  2017,3.3,The size of the room. also did not get room with bunk bed as requested. The parking was overpriced and not very accommodating. Food was ok. breakfast should be included. Shower head would not turn on. Did not refund 75$ deductible that is supposed to be refunded even though there was absolutely nothing wrong with the room. I personally cleaned it before leaving.,I liked the originality.
YOTEL Boston,Jeannie,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 2  2017,9.2,N/A,We absolutely loved the concept of the hotel. It was no frills but the details that were included were incredible. The bed was comfortable. the shower was great. I liked the toiletries offered. We especially loved how "smart" the room was! We could use the bluetooth to watch Netflix from our Samsung phone on the Samsung TV.
YOTEL Boston,Jo-jo,Israel,5 Reviews,September 30  2017,10,No door separating the room and shower/toilet (which we knew prior to arriving. but actually using the room this was was weird)Missing lightning in theroom itself.No coffee/tea maker in room. we were missing it :-/,Friendly staff - thank you Trey!Clean. comfy. location is great!
YOTEL Boston,Ed,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 29  2017,8.8,No chairs in the room. plastic cups just did not seem appropriate for the calibre of everything else at the hotel. Hotel geared toward youth and computers.  Disappointed no newspapers available. although staff offered to go to Walgreens to pick one up.,Bed was very comfortable.  ADA Bathroom perfect.  Rooftop deck a joy on the two sunny days I stayed - great sunsets!  Common spaces very inviting. Skillet breakfast delicious. particularly with pastry basket.
YOTEL Boston,Zico,Canada,1 review,September 25  2017,8.3,Maybe more staff at the lounge would be better?,The modern design of the hotel looked very nice. very appealing to young people. The washroom is very spacious. if all you need is a bed and the washroom then the rooms are perfect size for you.
YOTEL Boston,Rachel,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,September 25  2017,10,Loved it all it but the rooms are quite 'compact' which we knew before we arrived. We were out and about exploring the city so it want a problem as we didn't spend much time in the room.,Location cleanliness and staff
YOTEL Boston,Irene,United States of America,1 review,September 25  2017,10,The room seemed a little small at first. and didn't like the see through aspect between the shower and toilet. Had issues with self check-in and out where computers wouldn't accept the same credit card o used for booking. but staff help was right there.,I liked that the hotel is new and very clean. afficient room design. cool light effects behind the tv. Nice rooftop bar. but a younger crowd than me (I'm in my 40's). Two bartenders helped us. both were a lot less than friendly.
YOTEL Boston,Ann,United States of America,8 Reviews,September 24  2017,8.3,Cost of parking-which I know is expensive wherever you go in Boston. Could use a larger menu for lunch/dinner.,The unique 'cabin' approach was fun. Location; close to aquarium area is very nice.
YOTEL Boston,Kirsten,United Kingdom,1 review,September 18  2017,6.3,No tea/coffee. or fridge in the room. no room service - weird in a hotel in this price bracket. Very expensive. Advertised coffee/tea 24/7 in the lobby but after breakfast time this was only on request and at busy times had a long wait. Shower curtain too short and water all over bathroom floor.,The bed was comfortable and the toiletries were nice. location was good. Near to Yo Sushi. Starbucks. CVS. Brand new hotel.
YOTEL Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,4 Reviews,September 18  2017,9.6,The room is a little small,I loved the funky vibe of this hotel. The rooftop bar was amazing with great views. The room is smartly designed. I had fun with the mood lighting and has plenty of plug ins for your gadgets
YOTEL Boston,Rus,United States of America,1 review,September 17  2017,5.4,It is a new building and hotel.  The bed was good.  It does look cool. interesting idea. but.... Being an architect it is obvious they screwed up the STC rating / construction of the walls. you can hear everything between rooms.  I had staff come to my room over average TV sound.  It's a modern Japanese style hotel with micro rooms (fine) but the interior design lacks in many ways.  The bolted to the shower wall soap dispenser was empty and the automated housekeeping request failed to get it filled; after 2 days without soap. I had to call an actual human / go to front desk and bitch.  As a micro room with no table. you are expected to use breakfast-in-bed trays on adjustable bed/couch; the 'sleek' tray doesn't have a lip so when my coffee spilled it flowed right across bedspread (form follows function).  The sleek shower. with full glass and European fixtures. never kept water from running across bathroom floor or spraying out of faucet joints with no plumbers tape.   They portray themselves as hip internet based hotel - the controls for TV internet browser are useless. Probably the most disturbing thing is the HUGE motion sensor thing-ma-jig hanging off the wall. So large for such a small room. blinking lights at the slightest movement... I thought it was a router or energy sensor but it never turned off lights... very unnerving 'big brother' tension. Well never return mainly because the desk staff took my email for a coupon from the manager that never came.  Weak. I give you a chance.,location
YOTEL Boston,Donya,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 17  2017,6.3,It was outrageously expensive for what you got. There are all of these outlets everywhere in the room. but no place to work. There is no chair. nowhere to place your laptop to do your work. If the idea is to just have a room to sleep in then charge accordingly. and not charge for a full facility hotel and then provide an upscale hostel. The WIFI on my never worked and no one was able to help.,The location was great. The hotel was clean. The bed was comfortable and enough storage space if you are staying for a week. The gym was adequate. albeit a bit too small.
YOTEL Boston,Jeannette,Antigua &amp; Barbuda,9 Reviews,September 15  2017,8.8,I had to position the spray hose a certain way to be able to be hands free like a fixed overhead shower head.  I didn't like that the view outside opposite my room window was a building with windows across the way couldn't tell if people were there so I kept the shades down for privacy as my bathroom located next to that window. I didn't like they were no sample take aways of the personal hygiene bottled products (shampoo/lotion/soap etc) although I understood the bottles in the shower could not be lifted out past their necks of their holders. Myself and a guest almost got stuck in an elevator perhaps due either not selecting something correctly or other reasons. I wished the property upon check out had souvenir items such as t-sirts or mug or pens.,I like how the property utilizes technology for guest convenience and experience. I often overheard staff explaining to guests the concept of how Yotel came to be. At first my room surprised me with its layout and look like a Sci-Fi theme the back-lighting of the flat tv but after a few hours I began to appreciate it and like it more especially the spacious bathroom - toilet and shower separated by glass divider with glass doors very interesting. I liked the soap. lotion/bottled products usually they are mini sized at other hotels
YOTEL Boston,Anonymous,Italy,4 Reviews,September 10  2017,3.8,Everything. The room is like a cabinet in a flight or train. We had to open one luggage per time otherwise there wasn't enough room to move inside the room. No wardrobe. The bathroom was practically inside the bedroom as it was separated only by a white and almost trasparent tend. Each time one went to bathroom all room was lighten up also during night. The staff was inexistent. we had to do everything by ourselves. No coffee inside the room; there was no space at all. A nightmare for families. The hotel price is too taking into account the services offered by the hotel and the size of room.,Just the location near to Boston Waterfront. even if we had to walk about 5 minutes to get at the main attractions
YOTEL Boston,Courtney,United States of America,1 review,September 8  2017,10,I'm not the biggest fan of having to use the room key to use the elevator. but that's a nominal gripe.,Everything was just perfect for my trip. Incredible staff. superbly comfortable rooms. and everything was so easy.
YOTEL Boston,Craig,United States of America,11 Reviews,September 8  2017,9.2,No ice bucket. Plenty of ice a short walk away. but no buckets.,Totally impressed with this hotel. Never stayed with Yotel chain before. Fastest check-in in my life. 5 minute. maybe!! Not kidding!! Room was small. but totally impressive features. Comfortable adjustable bed. phone charging ports. places to lay stuff (tickets. key. change. etc) where you can see it when leaving. New modern fixtures. Oh. and very very cool bar on the roof. Loved it so much I'll be looking for this chain in other big cities.
YOTEL Boston,Marc,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 7  2017,5.8,The price. How small the room was. How expensive everything was at the bar and sky lounge. They do put a 75$ hold on your card which I don't recall seeing prior to booking. Plus a 49$ valet charge.,It was a clean room
YOTEL Boston,Anonymous,Australia,11 Reviews,September 7  2017,7.9,Interiors a bit over designed for me. Sometimes you just want a conventional light. shelving/fixtures that don't resemble clunky space shuttle fit-outs. Front desk staff could expand on their knowledge of local sights to better guide guests however door staff were extremely informed.,Hotel is a highly designed experience that seems to be targeting the young gen. I very much appreciated the value for money for the design elements including Duravit hand basin. However. I personally would've appreciated greater simplicity with an outcome of more room. Rooms were lit like a disco. controllable bed. rain shower head (not my fave as they lack power - shower big though); so much going on that it was clumsy to move about but entertained me at the same time! Towels were super fresh and the everything immaculately clean. I liked the door staff &amp; lift staff; extremely helpful &amp; a nice additional touch. The ground bar offered free tea. It's a fantastic location in a relaxing new area with good healthy vegan food &amp; other options nearby (open late night too). Downtown/china town was an enjoyable 25-30 min walk away &amp; getting around via uber was easy too with an open pick-up space out front. Hipster hotel hey!
YOTEL Boston,Laura,Canada,1 review,September 6  2017,9.6,The comforter had some dirty spots (white!). Need ice boxes. Shower was leaking where door swings open.,The room was unique and perfect for our purpose.  The bed was comfortable.   Love the towel warmer and waterfall showerhead!
YOTEL Boston,Colleen,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 4  2017,7.5,The shower was not 100% sealed at the bottom of the door so that when water hit the door it flooded into the outside floor area creating a large pool of water which soaked the bath mat. The decor was too modern european; no desk. no actual closet. decor is just not for me.,good security
YOTEL Boston,J,United States of America,1 review,September 4  2017,4.6,Mostly everything. Too expensive for 1/3 of a room. no privacy in the bathroom separated by a curtain. A/C was controlled would not go under 68 degrees so the room stayed hot..could only valet park and that cost $49.00 a night.,Nothing.
YOTEL Boston,Sofia,Sweden,8 Reviews,September 3  2017,7.9,I stayed for 3 nights and one day when I came back late my room had not been cleaned. The shower hose was stiff and nozzle very small. I would have liked to have somewhere to sit except for the bed.,I was there for Boston Comic Con and the convention center was within walking distance from the hotel. Loved the outer surroundings. close to waterfronts. Staff was very friendly and helpful at check-in. Bed was very comfortable. The room felt modern and had many power sockets. Great place to stay for solotravellers and couples.
YOTEL Boston,Sinan,Turkey,14 Reviews,August 30  2017,10,There is a parking just accross the street it is a bit pricey as the hotel is in the middle of the city. There is also valet option.,Amazing location. room. the hotel is very new and clean. it also has a rooftop. Staff was also very helpful.
YOTEL Boston,Sarah,United States of America,1 review,August 28  2017,8.3,Our tv stopped working so we had to call maintenance and they had to end up replacing our tv.The overhead shower never worked for us and our shower also was leaking into the toilet area.The valet parking was definitely priced too high.I was up until 5am both nights I stayed at the hotel because of people partying very loudly on my floor. I could hear them very loud and clear and it was so annoying.,It was a great location with waking distance to the city and close by to a lot of attractions.The room was very clean and modern. I loved the LED lights behind the tv in our room. The bed was very comfortable as well.The view from the rooftop was what I was most excited for. It was a beautiful atmosphere and a perfect starting spot to the night. Also made for great pictures.
YOTEL Boston,James,United Kingdom,26 Reviews,August 28  2017,9.2,The atmosphere was a little weird. The staff are very ernest - reception is called 'Mission Control.'  they insist on helping you do the self check-in which is counterproductive because it's impossible to read the instructions and speak to them and we found the majority of those working at the bar upstairs downright rude - the security staff were really friendly but those in hotel uniform wandering about with clipboards were acting like they were running a VIP backstage event. not a hotel bar.,The design of the room was great; very practical features (especially the moveable bed) and a great shower (once it was repaired). The location was good for exploring and handy for South Station. The view from the rooftop bar was great too.
YOTEL Boston,Joy,United States of America,1 review,August 27  2017,5.0,Shower was dirty. worst shower headIt was like staying in a closet. food was barely ok at the bar. ni customized breakfast no egg whites,Roof top bar had cool atmosphere
YOTEL Boston,Julien,Spain,7 Reviews,August 26  2017,9.6,Surprisingly more expensive than a similar hotel in New York. but apparently Boston is expensive. Cocktails at the rooftop are bad. no offense...,Very well located. Small room but well-arranged with very comfortable bed and very clean. The rooftop is a plus.
YOTEL Boston,Heather,United States of America,1 review,August 24  2017,9.2,The rooms are small kinda like a port room on a cruise ship. Need more lightening options as well.,Everything is hi-tech so we did have an issue with the bed not working one evening. The staff quickly responded and had that taken care of. The rooftop bar is very beautiful and lots of seating. Rooms are small but very quaint.
YOTEL Boston,Kenneth,United States of America,1 review,August 18  2017,10,There was a problem with the electric outlets by our bed that would only work when  hall lights were on. It also affected mood lighting. Only other complaint was the shower soap bottle was empty .They did offer to change our room which we declined and instead gave us $30 in coupons for food and drinks. It's a brand new place and I'm sure they will work out these kinks. I will definitely go back.,Fun. new trendy place. Roof deck was great. awesome view! Everyone was pleasant and extremely helpful. Saidia. hopefully I've spelled her name correctly. was always there helping us from checking in to finding a cab and then watching for our car from the valet!!
YOTEL Boston,Amanda,United States of America,1 review,August 17  2017,6.7,Shower leaked a lot. Glass walls around the toilet. no privacy. Thin walls.,Great location. we walked everywhere. Super comfy beds and a nice.  modern.  chic decor. Might stay again.
YOTEL Boston,Ekaterina,Russia,17 Reviews,August 16  2017,7.5,N/A,The breakfast is about 20$. but they have free coffee (with milk) in the morning.The room was very small (queen with view). when the bed was decomposed I couldn't go between the bed and the wall. And because of the room size. the conditioner was blowing just at the bed.Otherwise it's very convenient to reach the hotel from/to airport and the city center is close.
YOTEL Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 16  2017,10,Parking. 49$ a night to valet or park offsite somewhere for slightly cheaper. But that's boston I guess.,The bed was super comfortable and the shower was great.
YOTEL Boston,Laurie,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 15  2017,7.5,Little to no lighting... of course maybe there was a hidden switch I didn't know? Lol No instructions on the room.  Considering this is a small broom that efficiently utilized every space it would be helpful to understand things like how to use shower . towel warmer . lights etx,Location. cleanliness  conveniences in room such as charging station.
YOTEL Boston,Boston,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 14  2017,3.3,No need to stay at this property unless you want to experience an American version of a capsule hotel - or you want to pay way too much for feeling trendy!  The distance from the end of the bed to the wall was 10."  The air conditioner / heater was exactly right beside your head when sleeping.  In addition. Yotel is in a construction zone and on a busy street so it is noisy.   There was no bathroom door (a curtain). no chair. no desk. no shower cap. no actual closet. only pegs.  The coffee was the absolute worse I have ever swallowed (one swallow was enough) and you had to go to the ground floor and ask for it;  the water. at the end of the hall.  There is a $ 30. charge for check-in before 3:00 pm and that applies to 2:45 pm! and the website states that the prices listed include taxes. which they do not!,Windows open.
YOTEL Boston,Scott,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 14  2017,7.9,My wife was claustrophobic in the queen with bunk.She was also badly affected by the off gassing of new materials.,Loved the new concept and clean well thought out design.
YOTEL Boston,Katrina,United States of America,1 review,August 14  2017,9.2,Couldn't find my reservation at first,The stuff was super friendly.. the bar on the roof was awesome but rooms were a little small but to be expected in Boston
YOTEL Boston,Kriston,United States of America,1 review,August 14  2017,7.9,The room is very small. which I was OK with but my husband hated.  I paid $230 for 1 night but I checked the prices again closer to our departure and the same room was priced over $400.  These rooms are just not worth that much.  The bath room closes with just a curtain and the toilet area has a glass door that does not go all the way to the ceiling.  So. you are going to hear and smell everything.,My ten year old son loved this place. especially the bunk bed and the colored lights.  I loved the comfy beds. the cleanliness and the window in the bath room that could open and let fresh air in - which you might need in an open bathroom in a very tiny room.  :)  The location was wonderful and felt very safe.  The Courthouse T station is right next door which makes travel very convenient. There are two Wi-Fi enabled computers in the lobby for guest to use and my son liked that.  I highly recommend the sunset cruise from Long Warf which is about a 16 minute walk.
YOTEL Boston,Ian,United States of America,4 Reviews,August 14  2017,4.6,Overpriced. Loud house music playing in the lobby at all hours and the small 'cabin' design of the rooms are an obvious ploy to halve the size of a normal hotel room while still charging the same rates.,Not much. it was an incredibly overpriced hotel for what we got.
YOTEL Boston,William,Canada,29 Reviews,August 11  2017,7.5,The written instructions for the room did not include any for the window shades.  Before I spotted a remote control and guessed correctly that it lowered the shades. I had already sought assistance at Mission Control (the front desk).  When I called to cancel my request. no one answered and I had to go down in person to inform them.,The room was pretty well soundproofed. which was important given that it is located on a busy street.  Still there is a lot of construction going on in the immediate vicinity and if you want to sleep in during the week. good as it is. the sound insulation won't muffle the noise.  The design aesthetic of the property is early 2000's. which is already kind of refreshingly retro.
YOTEL Boston,Laura,United States of America,1 review,August 10  2017,4.2,The "cabin" was incredibly small. I only 5'8 and I barely fit in the the bed even fully extended. No room " fixing" the first night even after xalling for room service had to bring my dirty towels down to the front desk in order to get clean ones. Extended stay is too long not to have any ammenties.  Might be fine for a weekend but not longer.,Location near public transportation was excellent.
YOTEL Boston,Aoife,Ireland,8 Reviews,August 10  2017,9.6,Would have loved a price for solo travellers rather than a room rate....,Bed was super comfy - room very well thought out. Amazing view from room top bar.
YOTEL Boston,Vito,United States of America,1 review,August 9  2017,7.5,Rooms were small! I guess they advertise that the rooms are compact but I was surprised by how small it was. not very comfortable for 2 adults and a kid.,Very clean. new facility. Cool tech in the rooms (my son loved the lights!). Good restaurants nearby and it is walking distance to many interesting areas of Boston
YOTEL Boston,Sarah,Netherlands,31 Reviews,August 8  2017,9.6,There's nothing no to like. this place is amazing,I loved this property! Super modern. checkin/out kiosks are very fast &amp; efficient. spacious room. the most comfortable bed ever! Very clean. cute modern gym.
YOTEL Boston,Ashley,United States of America,1 review,August 7  2017,4.6,The room is extremely small for medical reasons we had to be upgraded. Certain things in the room did not work like the bottle opener or heated towel rack. And the fire alarm went off early one morning for no reason. Also we used the stairs to go get ice because the machine was broken on our floor but then we were locked in the stairwell and couldn't even get it to our specific floor.,The roof top bar was nice and the staff was. That is all.
YOTEL Boston,Niamh,Ireland,11 Reviews,August 7  2017,10,N/A,Great location. within walking distance to most attractions. seaport area has many nice bars and restaurants. The rooms are small but do the job. Very comfortable beds.
YOTEL Boston,James,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,August 6  2017,7.5,Free wifi failed me on the last day. right when I needed to book an Uber. but fortunately the check in staff assisted me.,Good bed. Nice lighting. Clean. efficient. modern hotel. Fantastic location in a great area.
YOTEL Boston,Scott,Canada,2 Reviews,August 6  2017,9.6,The ice machine wasn't working on our floor. No ice bucket to chill a few beers that I bought. Forgot to clean our room once and we were given a free breakfast. That made up for it. Tech wall was hard to use. Couldn't get music going in my room. Maybe have a little sheet explaining how to use it.,The location is excellent. Walked through the city everyday. Transit is awesome. Courthouse station right under hotel. Wish I knew this going in. Easy to get to from airport. Free shuttle on transit. Up and coming neighbor hood. Lots to see and eat in bean town. Rooftop bar is great. Awesome view of city skyline. Rooms are tight. but not there for the room.
YOTEL Boston,Diederik_S,United States of America,1 review,August 5  2017,9.6,Since the hotel just opened two weeks before. it was all still a bit 'new' and in startup mode. But nothing serious...,Great new hotel right on the harbor. I had to be at the Exhibition Center which is walking distance. but in the evenings went to several excellent restaurants in the neighborhood. The room was good (small. but you know this in advance - and the little tech bits compensate for this) and the staff super friendly and helpful. We had some issues with roomkeys and baggage which they resolved adequately. And the rooftop: check it out!
YOTEL Boston,Avery,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 31  2017,9.6,Did not like the fact that you have to pay an absurd amount of parking per day.,The room was small but cozy. had a lot of cool features as well. Skylounge had a very nice view of the harbor and the downtown skyline. Overall it was a nice experience. Very modern hotel
YOTEL Boston,David,United States of America,4 Reviews,July 30  2017,10,It's very near the silver line which is not one of the better T lines. This means you are not staying near anything touristy which can be fine for some. an inconvenience for others.,It is a very efficient hotel. Clean. simple. and effective - it is the perfect hotel for people who want to spend their time exploring the city versus sitting in their hotel room.
YOTEL Boston,Emilee,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 29  2017,6.7,It's super small and not having a fridge severely limited my comfort.  Couldn't keep a cold drink on hand or bring leftovers back.  Friendly staff. but no information about offerings upon check-in (breakfast. for instance). and there was no information card about what the hotel offers in my room.  Not a great value. in my opinion.,Love the shower; comfy bed.
YOTEL Boston,Emora166,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 28  2017,10,N/A,I thought the staff was excellent. They provided great service and we're always welcoming. The beds were one of the most comfortable. I also liked that we could connect our iPads to the media hub to display content like Netflix or starz. I felt like that made it a more enjoyable vacation as we got to relax in our room.
YOTEL Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 28  2017,5.4,Size of room and lack of space or racks to live out of our bags. Lack of privacy in the shower and bathroom area. Shower diverted valve was broken. Had to rig it at 1 am to get it to work.,No real dining area
YOTEL Boston,Alex,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,July 28  2017,9.2,The rooms are 'smaller' than your average hotel room. especially when you have luggage. but this is to be expected with the yotel chain.,Nice new hotel within easy walking distance to downtown Boston. The rooms are nice with lots of features. The hotel has a roof terrace overlooking the downtown area and is within a short walk of plenty of nice restaurants.
YOTEL Boston,Nicole,France,4 Reviews,July 28  2017,9.6,The only thing I didn't like was the price. but it looks like all the hotels in Boston are expensive. Yotel was the best last-minute price in the whole city!,I called the hotel to find out how to get there by public transport and they were very detailed in explaining me how to get there. I called a second time to inform them that we'd be checking in late and they were very polite and helpful. It gave a very good impression of the hotel right from the start! The facilities were all brand new and in tip-top condition.
YOTEL Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 26  2017,8.8,no desk and I had work to do.   I didn't realize that this was not at all a business oriented hotel.  I had to make a conference call from the lobby but the music at 5:40am (!) was so loud that my team in UK/Ireland could hear it on the call.  No quiet place to work.  No coffee for early birds though the front desk had indicated it would be ready by 5am.  Clean. nice. good for inexpensive personal travel but I am not likely to suggest this for business travelers.,comfy bed. perfect location
YOTEL Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,9 Reviews,July 26  2017,8.3,Sky lounge didn't allow 15 year old in when the space should be open to people of all ages. no seating in room. Bluetooth TV in every room has an identical name making it impossible to connect. Lighting controls failed once. and should probably have an epilepsy warning,Efficient use of space. comfortable beds. more than enough pillows. entertaining mood lighting. fantastic location. window that opened to allow air into room. containers of soaps/shampoos rather than bars and little jar things
Hotel 140,Miche99,United Kingdom,29 Reviews,November 2  2017,8.8,The air conditioning unit was noisy.,Boston hotels are expensive by UK standards and this was no exception. For the money. it provided basic but clean and comfortable accommodation (the bed was a large king size). The standard rooms were a little on the small side. but we only stayed two nights. I would rate the hotel for its location and there is an excellent coffee shop (and restaurant) across the street.
Hotel 140,Anonymous,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,November 1  2017,8.8,The decor in the halls and the guest lounge were a little dated and could do with a bit of sprucing up. Our room was also a little dark as it faced directly onto another wall of the hotel.,The room was clean and the bed was really comfy - the bathroom had everything you needed and the staff were very friendly/helpful. The hotel is in a brilliant location. making walking around the local area very easy (we walked to the Museum of Fine Arts. Boston Common. and the Freedom Trail. as well as nearby restaurants!).
Hotel 140,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,November 1  2017,8.3,Boston is an expensive city often during the year. so prices are high for small rooms. no view. This is similar to any major city.,Front desk staff was delightful.
Hotel 140,David,United Kingdom,19 Reviews,October 30  2017,8.3,The receptionist didnt tell us about the attached food place that maybe served breakfast?  We saw it when we left the next day!,Location and convenience
Hotel 140,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,October 30  2017,10,N/A,Immaculate room and very friendly staff. quiet but with bars and restaurants nearby. Only a few minutes walk to the rail station and a short drive to the airport
Hotel 140,Mette,Denmark,13 Reviews,October 28  2017,8.8,A chair in the room would have been good.,Friendly staff. Very good cleaning. Good to have the breakfast cafe at ground floor. Walking distance to many things.
Hotel 140,Tl,Thailand,3 Reviews,October 28  2017,9.6,- The bathtub was a little bit too complicated to use. but that's not the big deal :),+ Staffs were very very fast and professional services. and good advice for tourist information+ The rooms were so clean and new and comfy+The location was great..very near Back Bone station. The neibourhood was quiet and safe and there were some good restuarants.
Hotel 140,Bob,Singapore,19 Reviews,October 28  2017,5.0,room too small. staff not friendly. poor facility，no slippers. no bathrobe. no good food. coffee machine is not in room. fire alarm false report at mid night.,location  is good
Hotel 140,Rebecca,United States of America,17 Reviews,October 27  2017,7.5,Had an issue with the AC which made noise all night long and did not allow to get any sleep. not repairable and no other rooms were available to accommodate us. although we received some compensation would have given a better rating if could have slept,Location
Hotel 140,Susan,Australia,24 Reviews,October 26  2017,8.3,N/A,We appreciated the room where you were able to help.yourself to coffee and filtered water. There was also a microwave which we used for heating up a frozen meal.A change from having to dine out every night.
Hotel 140,Anonymous,Italy,2 Reviews,October 26  2017,5.0,Outrageous price for the level of the hotel. Room barely exceeding the size of the bed for the most expensive hotel ever tested in my life ( where I spend about 100 nights/ annum in hotels all over the world). Front desk associate rude and unhelpful.,CleaninessGood position
Hotel 140,Anonymous,Australia,5 Reviews,October 23  2017,5.8,The walls are paper-thin. meaning your sleep is interrupted by every snorer or wailing child on the floor. To get between the street and the lobby. guests (and their bags) must traverse two short flights of stairs and two non-automated doorways. Negotiating these after a long journey is not ideal.,An excellent location.
Hotel 140,Valerie,Canada,5 Reviews,October 23  2017,8.8,One desk clerk. although pleasant. was not very competent. and gave us incorrect directions. Didn't tell us there is a restaurant in the hotel.,Very charming. We went to see Gypay at the theatre. Loved having the little restaurant right there for breakfast. Much better than the usual hotel breakfast room.
Hotel 140,Ok,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,October 22  2017,5.8,The hotel was OK but overpriced considering its lack of facilities. I would stay there again but not at the prices we paid. No bar. no restaurant. Rooms were OK but too small for the price.,Desk staff were friendly. Rooms were clean. well maintained but small.
Hotel 140,Anonymous,United Kingdom,13 Reviews,October 20  2017,4.2,The room size of a "cell".

Hotel 140,Dawn,United Kingdom,1 review,October 20  2017,9.2,There was nothing really not to like,The hotel its self was clean. well maintained.well set out and the staff were always helpful.The location was fairly central to all sites.The addition of a 24/7 self service coffee lounge was a welcome surprise.
Hotel 140,Thomas,United States of America,7 Reviews,October 20  2017,7.1,View was another hotel. Check in was a nightmare. had to park in front of a fire hydrant and leave my wife with the car while I checked in and moved all of the luggage to our room. Staff offered no help and couldn't find the luggage dolley (because they didn't want to look for it).,Location was close to shops and food. Also near subway entrance. Courtesy lounge was nice. coffee. TV and tables. but I don't know if they are on each floor (My floor had one)
Hotel 140,Dalene,Canada,15 Reviews,October 19  2017,5.8,Very small room and bathroom. No coffee/ tea making facilities in the room.I was hoping to check in before 3pm because I had delayed flights with no sleep the night before-I got there at 9am and was told I would be called when the room is ready. which never happened. I checked at 1pm and had to wait until 2h30. So staff is NOT accommodating.,Location
Hotel 140,Anonymous,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 19  2017,10,Walls are a bit thin as you could hear full conversations. but in my experience of travelling this is a common problem.,Fab hotel in a great location to access all amenities. The hotel is clean and nicely decorated. All necessary travelling essentials are catered for and the staff were helpful. I will definitely be returning to Boston for another visit and this will be my first choice hotel.
Hotel 140,Anonymous,Canada,1 review,October 18  2017,6.3,We had a leak in the ceiling over one of the beds. and had to push for compensation even wrote a letter to management. should have been given one night's lodging gratis(hardly any sleep as the leak occurred at 11pm and wasn't attended to until the next day). Received partial compensation four days later.  Several errors in the bill. asked for separate bills and the desk clerk could not subtract the numbers. Several friends were at different hotels that were less money for more service. No coffee in the morning. no hotel restaurant and over $300 a night!,The location was good.
Hotel 140,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 17  2017,5.0,The room was very small and the bed was a small full sized. too tight for 2 adults.  The room was very noisy as it faced a busy multi-level parking garage.  The sheets were not very high quality and had we needed to stay more than one night we would have moved to another hotel.,The location was good
Hotel 140,Anonymous,Canada,6 Reviews,October 17  2017,8.8,N/A,Hotel 140 is a good. low-cost option if the standard chain hotels are sold out or overpriced in Boston. It is not a luxurious experience. but does have everything you need and the accommodations are clean. Room is a little right and could use renovations - such as the bathroom and room ceilings - but overall it is a good back up.
Hotel 140,Cornelis,Netherlands,1 review,October 17  2017,4.6,Bad quality spring(!) mattresses. beds to small for two adults. room size tiny. noisy (though earplugs available at reception). shower cabin with mold. extremely overpriced,Location. friendly staff
Hotel 140,Davidson,Australia,4 Reviews,October 17  2017,9.2,No inhouse facilities to speak of.  The shower was dreadful. very difficult to use and didn't work well at all. especially when washing hair.  We did ask to have it seen to. but this didn't happen.,The room was extremely comfortable the bathroom huge.  Beds and linen were excellent.  Location is brilliant. short walks to many good quality restaurants.
Hotel 140,Peter,New Zealand,65 Reviews,October 16  2017,6.7,No coffee/ tea in the room although there was a lounge on the 7th floor. The room was very small with only one lamp for lighting. disappointed in the size of the room as it was the most expensive room rate of our 3 month trip.,Very convenient to the Back Bay T station and many shops and restaurants.
Hotel 140,John,United States of America,6 Reviews,October 16  2017,6.3,Room was very small our state room on our cruise ship was larger. The bed position left virtually no room on one side of the bed to get in or out. There was room if the bed was centered to provide room.,The location was excellent close to everything.
Hotel 140,FawazAlmejlad,Qatar,15 Reviews,October 16  2017,3.8,The staff was not professional. The room was not ready when I have arrived after the checkin time. No room service. No safe box. No clothes closet. No view. You can hear next door people as you are in the same room. basically no noise proofing. Very small room. Food caterer close at 7pm. No bottled water offered at the room. Unstable bed. I wouldn’t call it hotel.,Good free internet.
Hotel 140,Anonymous,Italy,10 Reviews,October 12  2017,8.3,The room is rather small and furniture and floor do not shine new.,Prices in that area are high and this has a good price and reasonable comfort. Room conditioning is good.
Hotel 140,Karen,Canada,2 Reviews,October 11  2017,7.5,Room was very small and not the most comfortable bed.,The location was perfect. We walked all over Back Bay. North End and to the Seaport area. Close to Newbury and Boylston for restaurants and shopping.
Hotel 140,Anonymous,United States of America,13 Reviews,October 11  2017,2.9,Smallest hotel room ever (Smaller than Tokyo hotel rooms)Depressing hotelTried to charge me 2x price of room that I agreed to on booking.com (charged my credit card and am disputing),Nothing.  One of the worst values for a hotel in America
Hotel 140,Beverly,United States of America,1 review,October 10  2017,9.6,N/A,Location was excellent.  Concierge service was very congenial and helpful.  Bed was very comfortable.  Rooms are a little small but sufficient.  Plenty of hot water in the showers.
Hotel 140,Erin,United States of America,1 review,October 10  2017,3.3,Didn’t have A/C even after the janitorial staff assured us we did. Initially told there wasn’t a room available to transfer to then was finally offered an “apartment “. However. it was now after midnight. The staff the next morning were unable to do anything. The manager called me the following day. but still the lack of actions were inexcusable.,Location.
Hotel 140,Anonymous,Australia,11 Reviews,October 10  2017,6.3,The price - very expensive for a pretty basic hotel. No food or bar available on site.,The location &amp; the staff. The room on our floor with coffee and tea making facilities and a microwave.
Hotel 140,Anonymous,United Kingdom,19 Reviews,October 10  2017,7.1,The room was small and dark and the air conditioning noisy. However the bed was comfortable. No tea or coffee in the room.,The staff were very friendly and welcoming and we were able to get into our room at 10.30 in the morning! A good location for exploring Boston. close to bus and tram lines. good range of bars and restaurants within five minute walk.
Hotel 140,Thomas,Hong Kong,8 Reviews,October 10  2017,7.5,Plastic cups everywhere!! . No in room kettle or coffee maker &amp; have to go to 7/F to get a hot drink. No vending machine for cold drinks or snacks. No probable wardrobe. This hotel can become an excellent hotel if they are willing to invest a bit more to the bedroom facilities. It feels like going to a work's canteen . rather than a potential 4 stars hotel.  The hotel has such a great potential because of its nearby hi end shops. restaurants and excellent transport network and Avis. Customer are willing to pay more just for the hotel location but at the same time hotel needs to upgrade itself so it looks apart.,Excellent location to food. shops and transport. Great value.
Hotel 140,Jonathan,United Kingdom,10 Reviews,October 9  2017,7.5,Nothing,Staff very helpful and friendly. Hotel is well situated for exploring Boston and not far from Copley Square where the airport to Back Bay bus stops.
Hotel 140,Razan,Saudi Arabia,13 Reviews,October 8  2017,6.3,very small room and small bed not comfortable pillows . small bathroom and the house keepers are so loud you can't sleep early morning from their noise in the hallway we couldn't stay for more than one night then we had to move to another hotel.,Location
Hotel 140,Heather,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,October 7  2017,6.3,Decor is very practical. dark paint on all doorways. carpet which doesn't show dirt which makes it a bit soulless.,Hotel 140 is very clean and functional but it is a 'no frills' hotel. There is no breakfast. no pictures on the walls and it feels efficient but functional. Comfortable beds and room on quiet side as requested.
Hotel 140,Thomas,United States of America,1 review,October 7  2017,9.6,Bed was too soft.  Shower stall was way too small. the size of an old telephone booth.,Excellent location. adjacent to a T station and Amtrak.  Pharmacy 1 block away.  Breakfast restaurants within 1 block area.  Helpful staff.  Complementary Starbucks coffee in break room adjacent to our hotel room on the same floor.  Free morning newspaper.
Hotel 140,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 6  2017,6.7,The bed was HORRIBLE!!  We barely slept.  One of the nights we had to sleep with our heads at the foot of the bed in hopes we could not wake up sore the next day or even sleep for that matter.  Of course it's in the city so it's noisy and they did offer nice ear plugs which I took them up on.  I booked a Queen Bed and should've read the fine print harder.  It was basically a Full.  The room is SUPER SMALL. no coffee maker. small toiletries. not many towels - had to ask for more of both.  The biggest complaint I had though besides the bed was the fact that I asked for a "quiet room" and the girl told me it would be.  It was outside an elevator and they put a baby/toddler next door who was up at the crack of dawn and was busy talking or crying the whole morning.  We could hear them very well.  We also could hear the toilets flushing next door fairly loudly.  It was not a good experience.  I feel like we lost 2 days of vacation due to being so tired.,The lobby and location of the hotel to the city.  Easy walking distance to everything.  It is very clean and the staff is very nice.
Hotel 140,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 6  2017,10,The first night the air conditioner in the room was very noisy and I didn't sleep well.  But the next day I called the manager and they changed our room with no issue.,Hotel 140 is in a great location.  It is walking distance to great restaurants. shopping and more!
Hotel 140,Joseph,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 6  2017,9.6,If the size of the rooms could have been a little more descriptive for the hotel. When we checked in we were given a queen room. It turned out to be a little tiny room. next to a utility closet. There were no desk. I called Mirasale and explained my feelings. She found us a better room. I would have not wanted to stay the second night if we would have had to keep the closet room.We were very glad to have the upgrade.,The staff were the best part. Mirasale( I am sorry to misspell her name) was just fantastic. The hotel lobby and facilities were really nice. The coffee room on our floor was a great idea.. enjoyed that a great deal. At the middle and end of our stay Steve was great. He helped us find things. order pizza. held our luggage.. they were very good.
Hotel 140,Linda,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 5  2017,7.5,There was no information in the laundry room about how to use the chip card payment system.  I had to return to the front desk 4 times to get enough info to operate the washing machine.  The staff was very unhelpful.,Room was comfortable and location was great
Hotel 140,Anonymous,Netherlands,3 Reviews,October 4  2017,8.3,We booked 1 room with two "Double" beds but the room we were given had only two "full" sized beds which are much smaller than double beds. The Hotel said that was more booking.com's incorrect description and that's the largest beds they had. Had I know it was full sized beds I might not have booked this hotel as the room was for 4 people.,The Location was fantastic!
Hotel 140,Kimmyt49,United Kingdom,32 Reviews,October 4  2017,9.6,N/A,It was a good location within easy walking distance of most places of interest. The room was spacious and clean. The complimentary guest area with tea and coffee (real coffee) is a nice touch.
Hotel 140,Robert,Australia,16 Reviews,October 2  2017,4.6,The room was very small and cramped. the air conditioning was noisy and intrusive. the bed was small and soft. the tea/coffee facilities were on a different floor in a common room and the room rate seemed very high for what we got.,The location of the hotel was convenient for visitors to Boston
Hotel 140,Denise,United States of America,1 review,October 2  2017,3.8,The room was sooo Tiny.   I asked if I could purchase a larger room.  They said they didn't have anything bigger.   I asked for a roll-away bed.  I was told that they didn't have any left that I could use.   So I asked if the could give me two more pillows and two more blankets and I would make my 18 year old son sleep on the floor.   They said I would have to wait until 11:00 p.m. until another staff person came in.  I waited.   11:30 they brought me 2 pillows (no pillowcases) and 2 sheets.  They said they were out of blankets.   No fun for my son or myself.,Location.
Hotel 140,Kaylene,Australia,9 Reviews,October 2  2017,7.5,The 'room' for tea and coffee was too small and inadequate for a hotel of this size. They would do better to have tea/coffee in room.,Hotel 140 is very conveniently located to everything you want in Boston. The hotel is quite old and dated. but clean and functional. I think the nightly rate is a bit expensive. but overall a very pleasant place to stay.
Hotel 140,Jacqueline,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,September 30  2017,7.9,There was no bar or restaurant in the hotel. No staff available the morning of our check out despite being assured twice that there would be. so I had to leave my keys at the desk and follow up with emails. Sorted though. but inconvenient that morning.,We got a decent sized room which had fresh modern decor and was cleaned by housekeeping every day. The location was very handy with lots of snenitues nearby and close to the T stations. Felt like a safe area too.
Hotel 140,Normand,United States of America,1 review,September 29  2017,5.4,for $500 I got ripped off! It was the smallest hotel room I have ever been In. This wasn't even a $100 room. The room was about 5'-6' wider than the rather small Queen bed. The bathroom was so small. the shower stall was maybe 32" square? You had to close the bathroom door in order to open and close the shower door. A total rip!!!! I will probably never book through Booking.com again. even though I have had some good luck in the past.,Nothing. except location was pretty good
Hotel 140,Anonymous,Ireland,4 Reviews,September 28  2017,10,N/A,The staff were very kind and efficient and helpful..The room was super clean. .the bed was vety large and comfortable..i chose it because of the walk in shower which most hotels dont offer...the location was excellent. We enjoyed the musical Gypsy in the Lyric Theatre on level 2..that was a bonus for us..The hotel is within walking distance of most of the places we wanted to visit....and within 5 mins of the airport shuttle that stops on Copley plaza..
Hotel 140,Stephanie,United Kingdom,1 review,September 28  2017,8.3,The room arrangement could be improved:  we asked for twin beds and got dorm-room style which meant that it was very difficult to watch TV. etc.  The airconditioner was effective but noisy.  The hotel is very expensive in relation to the facilities. so not the best value for money.,The staff were very helpful. professional and friendly;  the cafeteria staff were also excellent. although food options and buying arrangements tend to favour people eating 'on the go' or taking away rather than eating in.  The location is perfect.
Hotel 140,Iain,United Kingdom,18 Reviews,September 26  2017,7.9,No breakfast. although there is a café in the building. Expensive for what you get (although this seems to apply to Boston hotels generally).,Less than five minutes' walk from the subway station.  Conveniently located for exploring downtown on foot. Reception friendly and helpful. Good bed and shower.
Hotel 140,Weekend,United States of America,1 review,September 26  2017,6.3,No place to pull the car up and unload. parking was in a nearbygarage. but no signage for the hotel and we ended up parking at thewrong end and dragging luggage much farther than needed. The roomswere European small. Bed comfort wasn't great and didn't fitmy 6'1" husband. No coffee maker in the room. Certainly notworth the money ($$$$).,Location was great. Easy walk to lots of things.
Hotel 140,Giulia,Italy,1 review,September 24  2017,9.6,Nothing about the hotel. but about the public transport. We tought the silver line to airport was a subway line. on the contrary it is a bus line. so we arrived late at the airport and missed our flight.,The room was clean and spacious. The bathroom was also equipped with hairdryer.Friendly staff and presence at the 7th floor of a room with coffee and tea machine for free.
Hotel 140,M,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,September 20  2017,5.8,Very small room for the price. Noisy:One bed was adjacent to a huge air conditioning unit for the room which made sleep difficult. It was incredibly noisy.  Staff gave us duff information when we asked about the wifi and facilities.Walls were very thin and we had noisy neighbours for one night which didn't help.,Good looking hotel with attractive foyer and facilities
Hotel 140,Ilana,United States of America,7 Reviews,September 19  2017,6.7,We were supposed to get a view and they changed our room last minute; we were supposed to be in 614 and got 825. There was no fan in the restroom and no natural light. Our neighbors could see us so we had to keep the blinds shut the entire time; I was not happy that they put us in a horrible room and tried to convince us that there was a maintenance problem and the room 5 minutes after we arrived was not "sell-able" but we weren't informed until I called to complain so it seems vert shady. They didn't do anything about it.,Ease of check-in. large bathroom.
Hotel 140,Pauline,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,September 19  2017,6.7,Our first impressions were how small the room was. We had a basic double bed which was so soft it felt like you were on a water bed. There was only a hanging rail for clothes plus a couple of drawers so we couldn't really unpack and we were there for 6 nights. The shower room was ok but could have done with updating. but I suppose it did its job. It's little things like there was only one   chair and only one bedside table that were annoying.,The coffe lounge on floor7 was a welcome bonus as there were no facilities in the room and nowhere in the immediate location to get a coffee without going out. The take away next door was very good for breakfast. The location was great. The tube station was very close and Copley Square/ Newbury Street were very close by.
Hotel 140,Johanna,Germany,1 review,September 18  2017,6.3,the hotel debited my credit card two times with the invoice amount - even after my creditcard company cancelled that second debit a damage due to currency changes and credit card fee remains on my account - not nice !!,construction works on the building
Hotel 140,Renee,United States of America,6 Reviews,September 14  2017,8.8,The room and bathroom were a lot smaller than expected also it was very plain. no real decor.,The staff was very friendly and the public places and room were clean.
Hotel 140,David,Australia,12 Reviews,September 12  2017,5.8,Room was extremely small and bathroom very cramped. Didn't even have a bedside table or light. Air conditioning did not control temperature properly. Very expensive for a room the size of a box.,Location.
Hotel 140,Martyn,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,September 12  2017,3.3,Very small room. Very noisy fridge and air con had to be turned off so we could sleep. Bed created on every small move. Very over prices for what it was,Nothing comes to mind
Hotel 140,David,Ireland,1 review,September 11  2017,7.5,Not a lover of fast food,Hotel location was fantastic .right in the middle of Boston.You could leave in the morning with a map in hand and walk everywhere in Boston. Great variety of places to eat on route as you took in the sights.
Hotel 140,Nicole,Australia,2 Reviews,September 10  2017,10,N/A,The staff were fantastic. couldn't be more helpful.  The position of the property was great and very safe for a lone traveller.  Everything was within walking distance and the train access was on the same road so easy to get to Salem for the day.
Hotel 140,Leanne,Australia,9 Reviews,September 10  2017,6.3,Beds are very small. A double bed in a room where the bed is against the wall is not easy to get into or out of especially at night. Showers are very soft water flow and not enough shelving for 2 people in the bathroom.,Location of hotel
Hotel 140,Paula,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,September 9  2017,5.4,Desk staff were not at all friendly and rather unpleasant. Housekeeping staff woke us each morning between 8.00 and 8.15am hammering on the door in order to clean our room. Found this totally unacceptable:( There was quite a lot of dust in the room and more particularly in the bathroom.,Perfect location
Hotel 140,Graham,Spain,2 Reviews,September 9  2017,8.8,Breakfast is not included but there's a Viga eatery in the building (which serves great breakfasts) and plenty of other options within minutes.,I have stayed here 3 times over the last 3 years for about 10 days each time. Rooms are consistently good. clean and quiet and the wifi works well. The location is superb for almost whatever you might want or need to do in Boston. Recommended!
Hotel 140,Leila,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 8  2017,4.2,I thought check out was noon..no one told me it was 11. Had a work conference call that ended a little late. Starting at 11:00 I received 4 phone calls and one knock on the door rudely requesting if I was checking out and if I did not leave they were going to charge an additional $150.  That's all within 40 minutes. I checked out at noon. I travel a lot for work and play - never been treated like this - will never stay here again. Most hotels are more understanding and accommodating.,The Italian deli on the ground floor
Hotel 140,Deborah,Ireland,5 Reviews,September 7  2017,9.2,Staff could have mentioned the breakfast / lunch cafe that is part of the hotel.,Location was good. Room very clean. Checked in early without a problem

Hotel 140,Ian,Australia,31 Reviews,September 5  2017,9.2,There are some fairly steep steps at the hotel entrance and these may be difficult for some people.,The location is very close to the railway station and an airport shuttle bus stop. It is walking distance to Boston Common. Staff were efficient and helpful. with a swift check in and check out. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.
Hotel 140,Margaret,United Kingdom,11 Reviews,September 5  2017,9.6,would have preferred tea/coffee facilities in room,Hotel spotlessly clean. staff very friendly and helpful.  Fresh food available from early morning.

When I called about late night food options. front desk didn't know much,Room was nice! Friendly staff. love the bathroom products
Hotel 140,Nb,New Zealand,3 Reviews,September 1  2017,6.3,The room was very very small. We have been travelling around the sweet Coast and this hotel was the most expensive and the smallest/worst. Shower was dirty. However nice area for a short stay,It was clean and a good location
Hotel 140,Anonymous,United States of America,5 Reviews,August 27  2017,8.8,The room was smaller than usual for American hotels. but that was not really an issue. just unexpected.,The location near Copley Square was perfect. and the hotel itself was very quiet and clean.  The front desk staff was friendly. efficient. and helpful.  Free wifi and all of the amenities expected made for a comfortable stay.
Global Luxury Suites at The Theater District,Shiangyi,Taiwan,3 Reviews,October 10  2017,2.9,Terrible terrible experiences.Two issues. broken bed and useless customer service.The bed was broken when we checked in. despite we immediately reported this to the customer service team. they simply answered there was nothing they could do and left me to sleep on the bed with broken frame (Check the photo!) the promised to call me back to update their solution later on and will have the bed fixed before the next day I return back to the room. Yet. the customer service line person failed to call me back. even the inspector who came to our room at 5:45pm (15 mins before end of the office working hour) and gave his words to me IN PERSON to offer some alternative solution to me himself once he finished the call to your home office. so at least I would have a even bed to sleep on that night. and he never came back.I have zero trust in the company. their service or their team. I paid 4 nights for the suites in advance but the Global Luxury Suites( Churchill) left me sleep on a broken bed for two nights (in fact. I could not sleep at all at the first night) with no solid resolution or compensation plan which is ridiculous. Sincere suggestion. DO NOT STAY THEM!!,None
Global Luxury Suites at The Theater District,Anonymous,Denmark,20 Reviews,October 4  2017,3.8,The noise from the street in our 3rd floor apartment was unbearable and we were kept up all night the first night because of street construction. Also the is a hospital around the back so you hear sirens from the ambulances very often. Not a good experience.,The size was good
Global Luxury Suites at The Theater District,Jackie8,United Kingdom,31 Reviews,September 19  2017,9.6,The beds looked larger in the photos and were described as large double but were just queen which were too small for us so we had to use the sofa bed in the lounge alsoOnly 2 sets of keys for 4 of us so we needed to be organised  and try to go in pairs. Once we mistakenly took both sets out and I had to come back from Cambridge to give my husband the keys or else he would be stuck in the apartment all day as you need the key to lock the door. enter the gym and ascend the lift.Only a starter pack provided eg for loo roll. so need to buy your own etc,Location  great - Not perhaps the more popular Back Bay area but we loved it.   10 min walk to Freedom trail and  to Back Bay20 mins walk to Faneuil Hall and Aquarium/ferries. 7min walk to South Stn Just across from China town - so good food late evening Bright communal spacesExcellent fully equipped gym and studio 11th floor lounge and sky deck area Large closet spaces. big bathrooms Good well equipped kitchen Spacious accommodation for 4 of usLoads of storage space Views of China town and Financial district Lots of TV channels Friendly helpful concierge Coffee shop adjoining LobbyResponsive host who fixed minor things like door lock. microwave turntable  the following day
Global Luxury Suites at The Theater District,Mohammad,Kuwait,25 Reviews,August 23  2017,3.8,-old linen -Broken stove top from beginning which they accused us that we did it!! -I wondered why there are 2 vacuum cleaners? Guess why? One is not working!! Why it's there then!-Noisy like if the windows were open all the time especially during the night when we were sleeping you could hear every single car in the high road -very uncomfortable and noisy beds -Dirty carpet! I tried to be positive and not be picky during my my stay. but this one. until the time they sent the email of broken stove top I hope booking.com post this review and honestly would appreciate if the property was removed from list,Location
Global Luxury Suites at The Theater District,Eileen,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 9  2017,10,Bedroom window blinds -- too much light leaked in at night.  There should be drapes in addition to the blinds or some type of blackout or near-blackout window covering.,Location was great and the room was really large.  Also. we loved the 11th floor lounge.  We invited family to join us and had snacks there and played pool -- it was a blast!
Global Luxury Suites at The Theater District,Maureen,Canada,1 review,December 14  2016,5.8,The track lighting in the kitchen didn't work. which made it very awkward for cooking.  The fold out couch was uncomfortable.  The HDMI cable for the TV in the bedroom was broken.,Clean. attractive apartment and building.
Global Luxury Suites at The Theater District,Victoria,France,1 review,July 14  2016,4.2,We are corporate clients having stayed in this building for months. We were happy with the service. location and facilities. but we encountered a series of awful experiences. We wanted to extend our stay. but one morning we were asked very rudely to move out from our apartment despite having received a confirmation the day before. We couldn't move as we were on our way to New York. so we agreed that our belongings can be moved with care to a new apartment.What a bad decision that was! We emailed multiple times asking for the new location/moving in instructions explaining we'll be checking in at 3.30am with no response. We arrived at the location at 3am. the office manager had no idea who we were and our name was not on the system!!!! Someone else was actually listed in the apartment we were supposed to be in. After multiple calls in the middle of the night. we were finally able to move in and to our great surprise. we found out expensive clothes brutally thrown in our suitcases. a $10k camera thrown in a bag with keys and sharp materials which damaged a $3k lens and we had multiple expensive items missing (shoes. dresses. necklaces). As if this wasn't enough. we noticed the apartment was no where near of the same quality as the previous one we had stayed at and the room had two very tiny beds for me an my partner to sleep in?! The cherry on the top is that we tried showering and there was no water.  Absolute nightmare.,Great building and great staff working there. AWFUL experience with the team managing the bookings.
Global Luxury Suites at The Theater District,Mike,United States of America,1 review,June 19  2016,10,No complaints what so ever. Wish I could stay there again.

Perfect location. excellent staff and the other "residence" in the building we extremely friendly and kind.

Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,James,New Zealand,3 Reviews,November 1  2017,7.5,Despite saying that there was no parties to be held after 9:00 pm. we were woken to some extremely loud and selfish people at 12:15 am.  The noise went on for a long time and they would not be quiet - really annoying as we had an early appointment to get too. Some lights didn't go. The extra Fob access we were given didn't work,Bed was comfortable the apartment was clean and modern. Good amount of space.

Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 24  2017,6.3,Well. for starters. one key was missing.  so combined with only one person having a key. there was the stress and added duty to document that we were not the one's to loose or misplace the second key.Second. the heat was busted.   You could turn it on but it never stopped - just got hotter and hotter. we were concerned for safety.Third. there were shortcomings with basic necessities while traveling.   ie:  no full length mirroran iron shaped object that heated for 30 seconds then shut off.   It took me over 45 minuteshour to iron formal dress.  I had to repeatedly wait for the iron to heat for 30 second intervals.,location

Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Lisa,Australia,24 Reviews,October 5  2017,8.3,More instructions on how to use the TV/TiVo etc in the apartment - international guests are not necessarily used to the US system.More mirrors please! We had 3 girls trying to get ready in the morning and there was only one mirror in the bathroom.An electric kettle would be good. Kettle on the stove is too slow.,Lovely quiet apartment block with beautiful gardens.Great location - walked to most places from the apartment.Friendly and helpful concierge who helped us with working out our TV settings
Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Carolyn,Australia,18 Reviews,September 29  2017,8.3,Hosts not being on premises meant we felt somewhat isolated though the door staff. especially Eric. were very helpful. The washing machine failed to drain and spin after only one successful wash so that was trying as we had lots of laundry to do. and had to drip dry it! Also. there was no tea towel and we missed that as we chose to wash our pots by hand.,Lovely apartment in excellent location. ideal base for visit to Boston

Apartment was dirty. we found finger nails (!!!) on the sofa and armchair. There was only one key. we contacted the host but they could not provide another one. Since we stayed there with several people this was really bad. The door bell system / speaker system does not work and it was hard to get access if somebody else had the key.,Apartment is spacious. two main beds are comfortable.
Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Sandra,United States of America,1 review,September 19  2017,9.6,Was told parking extra and that was none available. In order to pay for parking. I would have had to have provided a money order. Hassle. Include parking on site in overall price for rental.....,It was clean and on the first floor. Access was easy.
Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Anonymous,Malaysia,2 Reviews,September 17  2017,6.7,We had a hard time to check in. There was an email instruction to ask me to unlock the lock box and collect the fob and key. We've tried very. very hard and the lock box can not be unlock with the pin provided.We spent more than an hour and called Stay Alfred a few times. Luckily the concierge was nice and provided us the key. You need to look at your lock box condition if you want your tenants to collect the keys themselves. or they can't check in smoothly. Other than this point. everything was good.,Clean and cosy. Good location

Great location and fabulous standard of furnishing throughout. We had a top floor. 3 bedroom with large terrace.Rooftop terraces are lovely and the views are awesome. evening skyline is amazing.

Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Maureen,Bahrain,14 Reviews,September 13  2017,10,The instructions for collecting the keys were detailed and easy to follow. but the key box was a little hard to open.,Beautifully furnished and very comfortable. This place is in a great area. a short walk from shops. cafes and public transport.
Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Anonymous,Canada,19 Reviews,September 13  2017,9.2,Washing machine didn't spin properly. Took a long time to dry sopping wet clothes because the dryer didn't heat either.Instructions said there would be a second key fob in the room. There wasn't.  Light bulbs not working in master bedroom closet.,Location.   Nice apt.   Comfortable beds. Concierge. Eric. greeted us and was most helpful with parking. orientation etc.
Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Anonymous,Colombia,7 Reviews,September 4  2017,8.0,The instructions given to pick up the key. instead of saying go left. go right etc. just tell us go to Garrison No 30 and it would be easier to put the movable lock boxes somewhat higher up on the gate. so your guests don’t have get on the knees to open the box. which is not very easy either.,The location and cleanliness of the place
Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Alicia,France,3 Reviews,September 4  2017,10,The underground parking is very small for a minivan even though the location under the building was convenient.  Garage door opener did not work.  Also was surprised that coffee wasn't supplied for whole stay.,Location. spaciousness. quiet and great  value Very nice property
Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Maureen,Argentina,1 review,September 3  2017,7.9,No internet for 5 of the 7 days we were there costing me a fortune in international roaming fees to access internet from the apartment; no 2nd FOB key for the other family member staying with me (a second FOB was promised in the contract). slow response by Stay Albert to rectify these two problems. noisy hallway fire door that shook the apartment every time a resident entered or exited.  Also. there was deceptive advertising since booking.com said I had 24-hours to cancel. but Stay Albert indicated otherwise once I booked.,Great location. cleanliness. comfort and condition of the apartment.  Nicely furnished and equipped. Beautiful inner courtyard.
Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Zhen Chen,Bermuda,1 review,August 29  2017,2.5,Please do not stay in room 30-302. it only qualifies 2 star:-  Day 1. toilet overspill like a whirpool-  Day 2. no hot water for taking bath in the evening!-  no wifi connections in both bedrooms-  Carpet is quite old and a bit disgusting-  Linen is really very old and definitely you see those in budget hotels-  The blinds are really old and everybody is forced to wake up quite early in the morning-  Hotline is NOT helpful at all. the guy. Henry promised to send someone to check on toilet on Day 2. nobody came!the guy Ben. hung up my call when i complained about no hot water!Another lady (forgot her name) promised to send someone to check the water tank on Day 3 but nobody came!,enough space
Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Barb,Canada,1 review,August 28  2017,10,N/A,The comfy bed and having a home away from home. The conceige staff were all very approachable and helpful. The communication that was sent to us before our arrival was very helpful and verydetailed. The apartment had been throughly cleaned and ready for our arrival.
Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 22  2017,9.6,Parking was expensive and the master bedroooms toilet ran- so we had to keep the bathroom door closed- so we didn't have to hear it Otherwise everything was fine,Location!! Apartment was very clean!
Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Cindy,United States of America,5 Reviews,August 11  2017,7.5,The unit we had was on the ground floor. So it basically felt like a basement. since you couldn't really open the blinds. Otherwise anyone in the public courtyard area could see right into the unit. That included the living area and bedroom. so privacy was a bit of an issue. Not great if your there in the day or want to get some real natural light in the morning. Plus. as people came and went it was a bit noisy at times. Also. didn't like the fact you couldn't get a late check out. due to back to back bookings.,The Garrison apartments are in a great location. Easy to walk to many places in Boston. Close to shopping. restaurants and easy to grab an Uber.  The concierge at the apartments were nice. They even let us store our bags. since we had a late flight. allowing us to do a bit more sightseeing before we left. Unit was clean and had everything as noted. Wifi was good. but ATT cell signal isn't very strong there.
Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Eric,United States of America,1 review,August 8  2017,7.5,The pull out bed in the couch was stained and had mildew on the bottom side of the mattress. We ended up sleeping on just the couch. The water pressure was very low in the shower.,There was plenty of room for our family of five. The kitchen had everything you would need to cook just as you would at home. Although we were always on the run and did not use the kitchen facilities much.

Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 27  2017,9.2,the directions and wifi information emailed to me were incorrect. having to throw out all our trash in the garage prior to leaving especially after paying a cleaning fee included in our reservation. the water heater sprang a leak the last night we stayed. StayAlbert could not contact the maintenance person on the same night. They arrived the following morning.,the convenience of the location to our conference. the area was great and the availability of outside amenities was very good! (food. transportation. activities. etc.)
Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 26  2017,3.8,First apartment we went into smelled so horrible we had to move out and got moved to the wrong room size and finally 2 hours later got into a comparable room.  The following night we were told we had to move out of that room as new tenant was arriving and so against our permission our personal items were packed for us.  In the end we cancelled our plans and went and found another hotel.  Will never use this company again,Location of apartment was the only positive of our stay. Central to Copley Place.
Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Jeremy,United States of America,9 Reviews,July 17  2017,7.5,took me a while to get the key (maybe I am not familiar to the system).  The apartment door knot was broken.  While tele-customer service told us to check the property manager. it takes time to fix and not as convenient as the hotel.,Great Location! Easy access to all the living necessity!  Good space and good room!
Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Kerri,United States of America,1 review,June 24  2017,6.3,There was a dog park right behind the property. &amp; we would wake very early to the sounds of dogs barking or fighting. Also. awoke to someone using a hammer in the apartment directly above us at 7:30 am one morning. The property is supposed to have a quiet policy between 9:00 am - 9:00 pm. I wish this property had been a little less expensiive. we paid about $335 a night &amp; stayed 5 nights.,I booked this apartment because I traveled with my husband. daughter(who is almost 17) &amp; son(who is 20 yrs old) and I wanted separate bedrooms. It worked perfectly. plenty of space. The property was stocked with. dishwashing soap. towels. detergent for clothes. paper towels. coffee filters etc. anything else that we needed. we walked to the star market (very close) &amp; bought.  The location was great. the outside property was beautiful. One day when we came back to the apartment after our busy day in the heat. there was an ice-cream truck for the residents on the property &amp; we all got a scoop of ice cream. what a treat!  There is an outdoor area on the property with furniture that is a lovely place to sit and relax in the shade.
Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Richard,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 30  2017,9.2,N/A,Great location. lots within walking distance (including starbucks and 7-11).  Taxis and subway nearby. underground parking garage with elevator.  Two bathrooms sped things up in morning.
Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Sherry,United States of America,15 Reviews,May 24  2017,7.1,No keys in box. didn't receive till next am after 11. only 2 packs of coffee for a 5 day stay. could have used more bath products for 5 day stay.,location was great! space was great
Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Cheryl,United States of America,1 review,May 16  2017,6.0,The apartment is in need of a thorough updating.  Everything in apartment is on the low end. dated decor. and attention to detail is overlooked.  Carpet worn. patched areas on walls look shoddy. cheap interior doors. furniture old and uncomfortable.  The arm of the armchair in living room is barely hanging on.  The couch is worn and uncomfortable.  Chips in the bathtub have been patched. cabinetry is cheap and flimsy.  Has "popcorn" ceilings throughout--very 70's or 80's.  The apartment has the cheapest shower heads you've ever experienced!Also needs a thorough cleaning.  All of the bathroom grout in bathrooms are dirty and dingy. There is moldy grout in dated bathtub. fans in bathroom can not be turned off if you have the light on. yet are so filthy they don't remove any mist.  Mirror is completely fogged after shower.  And the fan is very. very loud. so you will wake up everyone when you turn on the fan/light.The blinds throughout the apartment are the cheapest I have ever seen.  Some don't adjust at all. and in the master bedroom. the morning light is a direct hit.  Would have loved to have slept in past 6:30 (3:30am for us with time change) but there is no option to keep the sun out.  The blinds did not adjust to other direction. which may have helped.Amenities are poor:  single ply toilet paper and no kleenex anywhere.  It would be nice to have a throw blanket or two in living room.  Blankets are very thin. and there were only 2 extras in the closet (granted. it was very cold when we were there).I don't know if the person directly above us is a permanent tenant or short term renter. but he/she stomps pretty much all day and night.  We went to sleep listening to pounding. and woke up to pounding.  May be a temporary problem. but unfortunate that we had to experience it.So. bottom line:  if you are used to higher end accommodations. like the Westin Copley. this is not the place for you.,The location is great.  Happy to have the 2 bathrooms.  Kitchen was small. but very nice and perfectly adequate for making coffee and having cereal.
Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Ximena,Guatemala,27 Reviews,April 18  2017,8.8,There is no cleaning service at all during your stay. Some minor issues in the apartment. like a few  blinds missing  in one of the bedrooms. a loose cabinet door and a burned lightbulb in the bathroom.,Location was excellent. Walking distance to Copley Place. Prudential and Newbury Street. Spacious and Modern apartment was perfect for our family of five.

Garrison Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Suddhiman,Thailand,40 Reviews,December 17  2016,8.8,Bathrooms look somewhat worn-out. would be good if refurbishment is considered.,Great Location. very near Copley Place. Prudential Center. T stations (Back Bay w Amtrak and Prudential). 5 min walk to Shaw's Market. plus we enjoy the Corridor Park at the back. The area is safe. security is ok. It is also very convenient to have a parking space right in the basement where you can use the elevator directly up to your unit with security key to each small entry.Rooms were clean but bathrooms could be better with some refurbishment (i.e. some chips. bathroom's cabinet mirror hung out and could not close well. bathtub looked really worn-out. Clean linens and towels were well provided. The kitchen was clean and well stocked with all cooking utensils one needs for basic cooking. especially like their big fridge.  washing machine works fine. Wifi works well. We had a nice stay at the apartment for the second time. no luxury but comfortable and convenient. We love the feel of an apartment and the fact that we can cook if we feel like. it was nicer than staying in two connecting rooms at a luxury hotel.

Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Leslie,Canada,3 Reviews,September 19  2017,10,There was only one 10 cup coffee packet available for 4 of us for 2 nights.  :-(Just an FYI - (this is not the fault of the owners but the parking was not included...) we paid extra to park with LAZ in the same building.  It was a terrible experience on the way in and out.  Waited for the attendant both times.  On our way out. we were late for an appointment because the attendant had the "gone for 5 to 10 minutes" sign up but never showed up in the 25 minutes we waited.  Had to be released from the parking by a parking valet from another hotel!!,Such a central location - close to everything!  Great view!  Lots of kitchen equipment for cooking if you want to. wonderful open plan. washer and dryer had 3 boxes of laundry soap for us to use.  Clean and bright!  Shops to get food and beverage just a step away.

It turned out to be a toilet leaking which was resolved the same day but should have been noted by the cleaning crew. Cleaning was ok (not great) but they left towels in washing machine.,Spacious and comfortable
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Mary,Singapore,2 Reviews,August 7  2017,8.8,It was a hassle not being able to leave our luggage at the building when we arrived early (but the hosts proposed an alternative solution). We had a minor issue with a leaking tap in the bathroom. which should be easy to fix. Just adjacent to the entrance of the building there were a few homeless people begging / hanging around at night.,The location was convenient. The property was very modern and spotless. decent finishes and facilities. The master bed was big with nice linen. It was handy that the hosts provided small bottles of dish washing &amp; laundry detergent.
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Faisal,Saudi Arabia,1 review,August 6  2017,10,N/A,the location is great. It is a little expensive but Stay Alfred services and support is worth the the premium. They have been very responsive for all inquiries and requests. A special appreciation to Erica from customer service in Stay Alfred as she was great in helping us when the alarm system had a malfunction that made it go on at mid night and Erica along with customer services had been professional and outstanding handling of my issues as they put us in a different apartment and refunded the day of this incident. Stay Alfred had two things that are worth the premium and appreciation 1) attitude with customers 2) supportive actionsA good attitude towards customers is a skill that is very rare and the way Erica managed it very well. She was supportive and checked on my family  again to ensure that we were ok. Also she made sure that appropriate actions were taken to fix our problem along with compensation.This is "walking the talk" when it comes to customer service. Stay Alfred is a premium service provider that is at par with a 5 star hotel
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,William,Guernsey,1 review,August 6  2017,9.6,I didn't like not being able to properly lock the door to the balcony on the 25th Floor.  Not good with a seven year old (at all).  There should be a lock with a key which could be removed.  Otherwise excellent.,N/A
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Mishael,Saudi Arabia,5 Reviews,August 4  2017,6.3,The location is terrible. homeless people and drug addicts in the streets all around.. we even saw a police car pick up over 20 addicts while we were there.. if you are traveling with children. do not book this apartment! My 4 year old was scared of a homeless man there with a red eye and we saw him every time we went out.. the price was also TOO high for the real value of the apartment.. we used to stay in the West End (much better neighborhood) for much cheaper!,The apartment was amazing! Big and accommodating.. it was fairly clean and had all the supplies we needed for our first day so we did not need to go shopping for cleaning supplies and such right away.. everything we needed was close by with CVS and Walgreens just across the street and Boston Common within a walking distance.. it took us about 30 minutes walking to MGH..
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Sharon,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,July 23  2017,6.7,Flat was not clean when we arrived &amp; they tried to charge us fully for cleaning  after our 1 night stay . There were certain things  broke. like. blinds. kitchen door units. which fell on us  Looks lovely  &amp;  is spacious but some ares need attention &amp;  repairing.,Large flat
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Andy,United Kingdom,24 Reviews,July 22  2017,6.7,The smell of dope drifting into the apartment from next door. Small things like towel rail failing off the wall. light bulbs blown.. simple stuff that should be sorted. Cleaning fee added to the bill is extortionate.,The view &amp; location.
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Sylvia,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 11  2017,9.6,We had a three night stay. but there was only enough coffee for two nights.  These details matter.,The apartment was very. clean. spacious and comfortable.  It's also close to the major downtown attractions.
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Carol,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,July 1  2017,9.6,Quite expensive apartment and main grocery store was 7 minute walk away. but neither of these observations would put us off rebooking!,Excellent property centrally located. very clean and modern.  Located on the edge of China town but very close to Boston common and good subway links.  Generally  felt very safe but like most cities there were few undesirable characters hanging around. but at no time did we feel threatened.
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Joshua,United States of America,1 review,June 30  2017,10,N/A,The location is right in the heart of the theater district and within easy walking distance to the Boston Common and Public Gardens. and the concierge service at the desk was welcoming and helpful on arrival and departure. This is a great property for families visiting Boston.
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Cheryl,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 26  2017,6.7,The property is in Chinatown. Good location to subway but at night the people walking around are downright scary!  Daytime - ok. Nighttime (after dark) - NO.,The apartment itself was excellent. A lot of space and perfect for a family of 4. Younger child could go to sleep in one bedroom while the older kid and us could stay up. Modern and clean. Liquor store right next door ğŸ˜�
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,FTT,Indonesia,18 Reviews,June 26  2017,7.9,There are 3 things I don't like :1. They still need us to fill the contract with them and I think this is complicated. I stayed in some apartments using booking.com. but this time I think their requirement was too much for me. 2. I don't like their aircon.  The fan blows too strong from the aircon even we switched to low. it's still too strong and too loud. 3. They didn't prepare the sofabed for us as we told them that we are 5 adults. but they prepared the sheet. pillows and blankets.,It feels home. The apartment was nice. but too pricey. The location is surround chinatown. easy for foods. shops and subway.
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Philip,United States of America,7 Reviews,May 29  2017,7.1,It's in Chinatown. where it's seedy and the homeless in the neighborhood tend to be a little aggressive.  You can park in the building. but it's costly.,The property was close to all. comfortable beds and nice kitchen.
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Shannon,United States of America,1 review,April 6  2017,10,I had no idea how expensive it was to park. 3 days cost 124 dollars! That was not expected and pretty steep.,Location was great for walking everywhere!
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Regina,Philippines,19 Reviews,March 19  2017,9.2,An electric kettle would have been nice.,Appreciate very much the washer and dryer inside the unit which saved me a venture outside in the cold to find a laundromat.
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Olivia,United Kingdom,1 review,March 15  2017,8.3,Pillows and mattresses a bit soft. The bedding was blankets as opposed to pillows. which wasn't ideal when the outside temperature dropped to -12. Cleanliness was really good for the most part but there was a few hairs scattered around the place. The major downside for myself and the rest of my party was the lack of storage for luggage as check-out was 11am &amp; the apartment needed to be ready for another lot of guests but our flight was in the evening. Alternative suggestions were provided by Stay Alfred but unfortunately none were suitable.,Modern decor with plenty of storage and a functional kitchen. The kitchen was equipped with crockery &amp; cutlery in addition to lots of fridge space and an ice machine so the option to store food and dine in was available. No hassle check-in and entry to the building was secure but easy to get in. There were large mirrors in the bedrooms. which was ideal for getting ready. It was also great to have a TV with cable that gave us plenty of choice. The welcome basket/mini hamper was also a really cute touch.
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Ann,China,4 Reviews,February 16  2017,5.0,Very very poor service . rude staffs ! I booked two departments with 4 rooms on line ! And I have gotten the confirmations from www.booking.com the confirmation No. is 50790 and 50791 I have attached as pics ! but when I checked in the staffs ( two guys . one is young and the other one is older ) told me that I booked one apartment only . I told them I booked two and I have the confirmation numbers....but they answered me that we don"t accept confirmation Number . we accept names only . But the problem is you can not find the names with my reservations right ? So I pleased the staffs helped me to contact the booking . call them . don"t leave message only it was almost 11PM and my cellphone almost no power at that time BUT they said it is my problem. they can not do anything for me .....my god ! I never met the staffs like this.... finally I found the other apartment Number from my email box . and showed to the staff (the older guy) he found the key from his desk ....... BUT I want to say . if I can not check my email box . means I can not check in with my confirmation number . even with my ID??? What "GOOD SERVICE meaning ???? It is mean you will get help when you need help right ??? It is not mean say greeting only !! The whole story as above . general: I spent over one and half hour for check in with unused confrontation numbers and my ID in this apartment! So I will never . ever stay in this apartment again and I will never . ever recommend this apartment to my friends!,Location
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Mayra,United States of America,1 review,January 17  2017,9.6,I understand the staff if not associated with Stay Alfred but while checking in the concierge didn't bother to check if our room was ready. We had to wait 2 hrs while our room was actually ready for check in,Well equipped
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Garry,Australia,6 Reviews,January 16  2017,9.6,More a few things to be aware of -Stay Alfred only manages some apartments in the building. Make sure you bring the check in information provided.The nearest supermarket we found was Roche Bros. 500m away. This supermarket has a great range of prepared food and deli items but is rather expensive. Jia Ho Asian supermarket  is only 100m away in the opposite direction but we didn't visit it.,This was the most spacious. well equipped and comfortable accommodation we stayed in during or trip to USA. It was also one of the most affordable. There was more than enough cutlery. plates and cooking utensils to prepare meals for a family of five. Our two bedroom apartment was very clean with two bathrooms and laundry facilities. Our room on the 25th floor had views over Boston Common and Back Bay. The hotel is in comfortable walking distance to most attractions in Boston and train and bus stations and supermarkets. Friends advised us to stay more central than Back Bay and they were correct. The reception desk is staffed around the clock and a key tag is required to enter the lift lobby so the accommodation is very secure. There is no maid service so you make the beds and keep the room tidy yourself. All cleaning equipment you may need is provided.
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Karen,United States of America,1 review,December 3  2016,8.8,The bathroom mirror had spots from previous guest brushing teeth.

Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Marypatrice,Canada,1 review,November 1  2016,7.9,We had paid for parking but had a non functioning parking pass so had to explain each time to parking office for validation. Showers sometimes had no hot water or had to run awhile to get warn enough to shower.,The location was absolutely fabulous. With comfy shoes it is very walkable to great coffee shops. north end restaurants Beacon St .Public Gardens. Freedom Trail. Boston Tea Party ships etc. etc. We uber'd when not walking but the T was right there had we wanted it. Easy to get to Symphony Hall and Celtics games at TD Gardens. The accommodations were clean. comfortable and well stocked. Better value than hotel at peak season. Good value.
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Stephen,United States of America,1 review,October 26  2016,6.3,Very heavy cleaning product smell on arrival took 24 hours to begin to dissipate. It was so strong we actually called to see if another apartment was possible but were told no. Nearly plugged drain in sink in master bath. Cable tv in MBR didn't work. The building is almost totally occupied by students. One of them reportedly activated a fire extinguisher at 2:30 a.m. that set off a full building fire alarm. After awakening to a very loud alarm we were instructed by intercom to leave the building immediately. So our family (including my son with Downs syndrome and my 85 year old mother) climbed down ten flights of stairs in the middle of the night and outside into an alley. We then walked around the block and stood outside in 45Â° temperature until we were told it was safe to go back up. Good times. huh?,Good space with two bedrooms and satisfactory kitchen and LR. Nice balcony. Indoor pool was good but heavy chlorine.
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Derek,Canada,1 review,October 4  2016,8.8,A few cleanliness issues. but not deal breakers.,Location was outstanding. The unit was spacious.

Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Claire,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,July 31  2016,9.2,Had to think hard about this and the only slight drawback was the traffic noise but that's what you expect in a city centre and it depends on how soundly you sleep!,Super apartment. Beautifully furnished and huge! Really comfy beds with massive walk-in closets! The location is good. 100 yards from Chinatown and the T station (underground/subway system). 10  minutes walk to Boston Common where the Freedom trail walks start from. Excellent communication from Stay Alfred who warned me before we arrived. that one of the bathroom cabinet doors was hanging off a hinge and as promised. the maintenance man arrived at 8:30am that next morning to fix it. Concierge on duty 24hrs. Swimming pool in 2nd floor.

Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Veronica,United States of America,8 Reviews,May 31  2016,8.8,My suggestions for improvement would be to replace the blinds to the balcony which have seen better days and to do routine upkeep of furniture. appliances. sinks. tubs etc that experience wear and tear. Also. a thorough cleaning after each guest is imperative.,We rented a three bedroom apartment in the heart of Boston's Chinatown for my daughter's graduation from Harvard Law School. The apartment was roomy with a kitchen. two bathrooms. and a beautiful view. We were near mass transit which made getting to Harvard campus by train very easy. The staff was friendly and we were very satisfied with our stay.
Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Anne,Australia,1 review,May 15  2016,9.6,Can't think of anything.,We were delighted with the apartment. It was well appointed. stylish and comfortable. We toll advantage of the gym and pool. We enjoyed it and would recommend it as a great. central place to stay in Boston. We did not hear a leap from anyone else in the adjoining apartments. It was blissfully quiet.

Washington Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Barbara,United States of America,10 Reviews,March 27  2016,9.6,Twice we had an intercom alert us of possible need to evacuate--once waking us up at 1:30 am in morning. Didn't need to evacuate. but wondered if that happens a lot. Street noise from adjacent Tufts Hospital was turnned out at night with earplugs. Nothing we couldn't live with. though!,Very roomy. nicely decorated. had everything we needed! Beds were comfortable. Washing machine and dryer were very handy. Even make use of DVD player to watch some Boston-shot movies we brought with us. Liked the balcony to "test" the weather before we went downstairs. Great to be so high up (25th floor). Chinatown T station was right outside. Boylston T station was also a short walk. Would definitely recommend this apt. to others!

Very large apartment with two very comfortable bathrooms. lots of storage. washing machine and dryer. and a full kitchen with microwave. hob and dishwasher. Washing powder/dishwashing liquid/towels/welcome pack of goodies provided. Located right beside orange metro line and just a few minutes from red line. Very handy for getting around Boston. Excellent tv and wifi. Nice (and very quiet) gym and pool facilities (thought the pool was freezing). Note - the apartment block itself has no affiliation with StayAlfred although this didn't impact us any way. The concierge desk was very helpful and stored our luggage after check out even though they weren't obliged to. Would definitely return if back in Boston.

The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Susan,United States of America,4 Reviews,September 7  2017,9.6,The only thing I would have liked. which seems petty. was to have firmer pillows or a few choices. They were all feathery and not my comfort level- which is the ONLY thing I can say about the Westin room we stayed in. Perhaps they offer that. but I didn't ask since I was exhausted once I realized it. Otherwise. it was perfection.,The view from the expansive windows on the 33rd floor was incredible. We found the access through covered walkways to the Prudential Center and Back Bay Station especially convenient given the stormy weather the last day.

The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Disappointed,United States of America,1 review,June 19  2017,4.6,When I walk in the room. I was assaulted by the musty smell. It was so bad that I had stuffy nose every time I am in the room. I did ask to clean the carpet and it did not help. Also power plugs for the desk was in the front of very old desk. the power plug was keep falling out.  There should have been more outlet on the desk for business.Also chargers provided by the bedside for iphone did not work. Alarm o'clock only accept iphon5 model. Also communication was somewhat difficult. I signed up for green choice. but they did not bring any extra supply of shampoo and conditioner. When I request for more shampoo/conditioners and wash cloth only. they brought the whole set of towels. so that I could not keep them all in the bathroom.When I finally request for cleaning service one night before through their phone service. it did not go through. and when I finally talk to manager about cleaning the room. it was done with even more sets of towels. In the evening when I finally unwinding from hectic day schedule. t I was called by the housekeeping and got a lecture (the lady keep repeating what I did wrong or at least it felt like it)For the amount of money they charge. it was a great disappointment. I stayed in this hotel for the conference at the same site. but I will not stay in this hotel next time. Please renovate the room (deep clean carpet) and change the desk that can be more function for business.,I came for the conference. and it was held on site.I did not have check out at the front desk.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Carol,United States of America,1 review,June 14  2017,7.5,Frankly. we have stayed here on numerous prior occasions.....I realize it is a very busy hotel BUT it is starting to look worn......I believe a facelift is in order.....,Bed was very comfortable and the view was excellent...
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Sandra,United States of America,3 Reviews,June 12  2017,5.4,For the $400 a night we paid. we got a small room (with a fab view) with barely any amenities. One. small complimentary bottle of water for two guests? The bathroom was tiny and old. and again. amenities for one guest. Frankly. I've stayed at Hampton Inns off the highway that have better features than this room. Never again!,The view from the 31st floor was wonderful.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Bobby,Canada,25 Reviews,June 1  2017,5.8,Over charge and refused to honour new price as I booked my room much early with booking. When the window move with 24 hours of check in. I found my room cost only 60% of my booking price and I protest fruitlessly with front desk. They even refuse to compensate w a breakfast. Frankly. the reception told me they cannot give me point for SPG my membership as my booking w the agent. So disappointed. I should be caution use agent next time in US hotel chains.,Location convenient
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Jonathan,United States of America,1 review,June 1  2017,9.2,Upon arrival we asked if early check in was available. and the employee at the reception desk immediately said early check in wasn't possible without even bothering to check her computer. I was a little frustrated over her response given that she didn't even bother to check the system. and was very short overall with us. We came to find out a little later that the hotel had plenty of rooms available for early check in through another employee who was kind enough to check us in.,The beds were great and we loved the view of the city from our room! The location was great!! Loved the fact that we could purchase coffee or snacks at any point at either the convenient store or inside the hotel's breakfast/coffee spot.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,6 Reviews,May 31  2017,10,N/A,Very good value. Excellent location. close to everything. Room is spacious and newly-renovated. Huge smart TV. And Heavenly Bed is comfortable as always.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Ivan,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 30  2017,3.8,Booked a room with a king bed. Upon arrival. they said that the king room was not available. and for that. they can give us only a queen sized bed. It would be nice if they called and communicated in advance about the shortage so that we would have booked something else. The bed ended up being even a smaller than queen sized. which ended up in me having a terrible sleep since I am a big guy - 6'4 and between my girlfriend and me. it wasn't enough space.The bathroom had a leaking ceiling and a nasty water bubble with mold. right above your head as you take a shower.While the location is good and the experience could have been better. my experience sucked. since I had to attend my brother's wedding and I had the most terrible sleep.,N/A
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,May 30  2017,9.6,The check-in process was slow.  Seemed to have lines at check-in every time I went through the lobby.,Loved the comfy king-sized bed. soft sheets. and pillows.  Complimentary Starbucks coffee and bottled water provided daily in room was an important perk for me.  The staff at street level to assist with transportation were kind and most helpful!  Spacious room with an unbeatable view of Boston!  I'd definitely stay here again.

The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Norma,United States of America,1 review,May 27  2017,10,It was cold and rainy for the Harvard Commencement and the room was cold. It was difficult to set the thermostat for the day.,The room was very clean and had a wonderful view. It would benefit the room to have some type of Fan in the bathroom.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Mary,United States of America,1 review,May 22  2017,5.8,As I said above we have been there a number of times before but not in 6 years. In the six years since we have been there the room was very run down. the furniture was scratched and chipped.There was a mildew smell in the room and the comfty chair in room room stank!!! The bathroom was rundown and old missing grout. We just slept and showered in the room so I didn't complain and we were so happy to be in Boston for my sons PHD graduation. But I felt it was overpriced and run down and we did the Club floor for an additional 50.00 a night and it was supposed to have a continental breakfast in the morning and appetizers and drinks at night. Well for a glass a wine they charged you an additional $14.00. We went the next morning to breakfast a 9:30 in the morning and breakfast was over. Where do you find breakfast over at 9:30..... So that's a waste of money don't bother...,I have been to this hotel a number of times before but not for 6 years. It was any easy check in and out. The area is a perfect spot in Boston near all great restaurants and shopping.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,cnc1,United States of America,15 Reviews,May 22  2017,8.3,It seemed a little thinly staffed for the volume of guests at the hotel.,The location is fantastic-within easy walking distance to shops. restaurants and variety of sights.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Paul,United States of America,1 review,May 16  2017,6.3,The suite was very expensive. We over-paid! Poor Climate control. the fan ran all day and all night. sometimes cold air. we became cold; sometimes hot air. we became hot. It was also noisyThis made it impossible to be comfortable enough to Sleep!,The suite was large. but the climate control was horrible.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Michael,United States of America,7 Reviews,May 9  2017,10,someone tried to literally knock down the door upon our entering and it sounded like a housekeeper good thing the door was bolted. im not kidding! never had that happen before,amazing view
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Anna,United States of America,22 Reviews,April 22  2017,8.3,I upgraded to a corner king which was small . I have been on other occasions in much better corner rooms.,The porters were extremely helpful and dealing with my many suitcases
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Happy,United States of America,1 review,April 22  2017,9.6,I thought the cost of the room per night was a bit pricey. but at the same time. it was well worth the money.,I loved how comfortable the bed was and how clean the room was. Also. the view of Boston from the room was amazing.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Anonymous,Puerto Rico,4 Reviews,April 10  2017,10,There were no bathrooms accesible in the first floors of the hotel  once you checked out.,The room was amazing and very comfortable. The staff was accesible and kind.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,David,Canada,1 review,April 9  2017,8.5,Move the ice machine or give me another room.,The room was lovely and bed was comfortable. but the room was located directly across from the ice machine which made a racket all night and was quite disturbing.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Andrea,United States of America,1 review,April 8  2017,10,I didnt like that we had to pay to park at the hotel even though I was paying to stay there for the night that should be included or free.,I loved the room and the river view that we paod extra for at our room. The room was very clean and the hotel was beautiful. If we stayed in boston again we would definitely come back. we loved our experience.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Hope,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 7  2017,10,I cannot think of anything I did not like.,The room had a view of the River that flows thru part of Boston.( Back bay area)Restaurants and shopping were close by. Enjoyed the extensive bridges thru the various areas in Boston( all covered). Also I am Star Bridge rewards customer.( got to be on a special floor). Customer service was excellent . Food in the Restaurant of the hotel was very good.I was able to have my bags kept in the hotel holding room until It was time to go to the airport.The business center was the largest I have seen. It was well appointed and comfortable. I used it to check in for my flight. It could have also been used for making copies.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Dawn,United States of America,1 review,April 5  2017,9.2,Room could have been a bit cleaner. Found a sock stuck in the sofa bed. Foyer floor was sticky and bathroom sink wasNot draining properly. However one phone call to housekeeping and both issues were handled within minutes ! Literally!

The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Christine,United States of America,7 Reviews,April 5  2017,4.6,had a 400 sf room - size OK but:1) Had to call for bathrobe (s) &amp; slippers.2) telephone - hand set not working3) bed (king size) tired (may have been  heavenly but no more).4) bath room ridiculously small - (why these rain shower heads that most hotels now use? where is  the efficient old speakman type?),OK for a single occupancy - Help/staff pleasant
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Yvette,United States of America,1 review,April 2  2017,5.0,For the money that was paid. the furniture was worn and chipped. The bathroom walls had toothpaste splattered them. The lights on the beds headboard did not work and more electrical outlets would have been nice on both sides of the bed. For over $1000 for two nights. it was not worth it.,Was close to where we had to go without going outside. Beds were airtight. Front desk was pleasant.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,24 Reviews,March 31  2017,6.7,Shower - terrible shower over bath set up. Taps falling off and awful water pressure. Hot water intermittent and drainage slow. We stayed for 5 nights and the only good shower I had was at 4am! Staff able to rectify drainage but l would have liked to change room.Room was surface clean only - house keeping did shocking job each day. Hope I have not caught anything from previous hotel guests!,Location amazing - so close to everything plus great access to public transport.Bed was super comfortable with lovely sheets.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Mulalo,South Africa,9 Reviews,March 24  2017,5.0,The staff is not attentive. They even lost my bag for about 4 hours without anybody knowing what happened to it. I was disappointed.having to pay for WIFI simply because I booked via bookings.com was not cool. They are supposed to be a top destination. so they must live up to those standards.,Clean and comfortable
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Maria,Argentina,4 Reviews,March 19  2017,6.7,It is too expensive for what is offered. No free wi fi available and the minimum fee for 24 hours wi fi is too high compared to other places.,Location was good and the bed was very comfortable.

The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Bob,United States of America,1 review,March 6  2017,8.8,Charges for everything. Parking (excessive) for visiting guests and even for us overnight. Also rented a movie but it was $17.99...Crazy.,Overall location and view.Walking tunnel and things to do in the area.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Changchun,United States of America,2 Reviews,February 22  2017,9.6,Swimming pool were under renovation so couldn't try it.,Real nice and efficient front desk. Nice place and location. Friends would not believe it that I booked it at such a low price. 139 USD.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Ronald,United States of America,1 review,February 18  2017,7.5,They gave us an "accessible room" which we did not ask for.  It would have been nice to have had a bath tub.  Also. it took 2 hours for our luggage to be brought up to our room. and only then after we asked what was taking so long.,Very nice bed and room.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Dragana,United States of America,11 Reviews,February 7  2017,9.6,I wish there was a bit more security around. Iti felt like anyone from the street could walk into the shopping area (part of the hotel) and proceed to the elevators and reach any hotel floor/room they liked. You didn't even need hotel room card to get to any one of the 36 floors.,Westin advertises its "Heavenly Bed". And indeed. Heavenly it is! I don't think I ever slept in a more comfortable bed! Absolutely wonderful!
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Martin,United States of America,2 Reviews,February 6  2017,5.0,Old decor....the door frames and picture frames were nicked and scratched. The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling. The odor in my room was bad and covered by some type of deodorizer. The furniture...sofa had a huge stain on the middle cushion. Would never stay here again..this property needs a renovation.,almost nothing about this hotel was really nice
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Sharon,United States of America,2 Reviews,January 23  2017,9.2,The waitress at breakfast. She never offered us orange juice when everyone else was offered it. She did not bring me milk for my coffee and never came back to check on us.,Bed was awesome!

The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Michel,Netherlands,18 Reviews,January 14  2017,7.9,Paid wifi is not of this time. I booked a riverview room with the booking.com but got city view.

The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Stephanos,Greece,18 Reviews,January 12  2017,9.6,Breakfast although very good. was not "out of this world" hence price rather steep.,Spacious room. everything functional. well presented and well maintained. great view. comfortable bed. very good bathroom. fast lifts. excellent management of so many guests in one place.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Fiona,New Zealand,10 Reviews,January 10  2017,10,we had booked for five people but had been assigned to a room with only one bed.

The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Tarun,United States of America,1 review,January 9  2017,7.9,Food was not great. Also for the size of the room- we had a king suite. the washroom was tiny. Talk about cleanliness- We found someone's dirty undergarment and hair rollers under the couch- Yuk!!!  The parking was a bummer- not only was it to expensive but we waited 45 minutes for the valet to get our car. We were traveling with a baby so was very difficult to wait that long for the car to come. Also the room cleaniliness was a big issue because we had a baby. I would please request the housekeeping manager to talk with their staff regarding that. We were planning to book 2 family suits again for family next week for a birthday celebration-not sure if we want to stay here again. Maybe will condider the Fairmont next time around.,Over all good. Great location- Convenient location to the mall. Good staff. Comfortable sized room with a amazing views. We were staying in 3012.

The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Susanne,,1 review,December 19  2016,6.3,This hotel does not live up to the Westin standard. The room had not been cleaned properly- there was a pile of dust under the cabinet in the entrance ( it had long legs so it was pretty obvious that it had been awhile since the folie had been bothered with). and there were some long black hairs on the bathroom floor. The bed skirts were very much askew which created a poor first impression as well. The decor is a bit dated but ok. We stayed 2 nights and the hallway. which was full of crumbs and dirt when we arrived. was still not vacuumed when we left.The breakfast buffé was barely Ekot warm-not ok for the price they charge!!,Excellens location. Comfortable beds.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Lauren,United States of America,1 review,December 13  2016,4.6,The fact that a herd of people came to stay in a room on our floor and they said they were sending security up. Yup. never saw security. Will find another hotel next time we come to Boston.,NOthing.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Kathleen,United States of America,4 Reviews,November 28  2016,9.2,-Hotel felt large and impersonal.-bathroom was small (but well appointed if you don't care too much about the little free shampoos which were poor quality),-If you want a great City view or River view. this is the hotel for you.  It's about 30+ floors so with an upgrade or an extra charge. you get a killer view.-Room was the largest of the 3 we stayed in in Boston.-bed was soft.  some might say too soft.  I loved it.  nice soft towels too.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,K. D. from Georgia,United States of America,6 Reviews,November 26  2016,9.2,Wow.....the size of the bathroom was ridiculously small. The toilet was very low and felt wedged in between the tub and counter.,Location. skywalk to the mall. the staff were wonderful
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Steven,United States of America,1 review,November 10  2016,9.6,N/A,The Westin is located in the heart of Boston with great access to trains and other public transportation.  Restaurants. bars and shopping are also easily accessible.  Breakfast buffet was also very good with a lot of options.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Keith,United States of America,1 review,November 10  2016,6.7,Hot water lasted about 1 minute for showers each day.  Exercise rooms was too small for the amount of people trying to use it.  Housekeeping staff tried to come into my room when I was changing at 8 am.  This was the day of checkout.  It was a good thing that I had my door locked with the steel latch.,Registration staff were excellent.  Room was nice.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Christine,United States of America,10 Reviews,November 7  2016,6.3,Our sink was clogged. The beds were too soft. The bathroom was tiny for that price. Parking overnight for $54 on top of room charge seems ridiculous. No pool or hot tub. How is this different from a Holiday Inn?,The location was great.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Stephan,United States of America,1 review,November 6  2016,7.9,Nickel and dime you for minor conveniences. Parking fees crazy. St 300+ a night free internet reduced parking fees and maybe even free premium channel access could " seal the deal " for frequent travelers,Good location good staff
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Saif,United States of America,5 Reviews,November 3  2016,6.3,First of all the Westin was way too overpriced for what it had to offer. The soundproof-ing leaves a lot to be desired. We were shocked that amenities were not available and had to be requested. in terms of toothpaste. razors. aftershave. mouthwash and basic necessities. For all that money this is the least that they could supply. We never had to pay Wi-Fi especially at the Westin and at this location it was $14.95 a day. Not enough charging stations near the bed for phones etc. Room temperature could not be adjusted and it was very chilly during the entire stay. And the attitude of the front desk staff is something that needs to be focused on. No warm welcome.,The central location was the best part of our stay. We had a decent room high-rise on the 22nd floor and a great view.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Jane,United States of America,1 review,November 1  2016,10,Upon checkout we requested that all charges be assigned to a different credit card of ours which was presented to the check out person. He confirmed the change was made but in fact it was not.,Service and congeniality in restaurant were excellent. Very personal service

The Westin Copley Place, Boston,Sara,United States of America,1 review,October 31  2016,10,Overnight parking was expensive (about $55 per night) but the Car Services department was so great that it was worth the price. Our car was always ready within minutes after requesting it.,LOCATION was fantastic! Customer service was excellent!A wonderful experience.
Two-Bedroom on Milk Street Apt 5B,Patricia,United States of America,1 review,October 30  2017,9.6,One of the showers could have been cleaner. Mold in the grout needs to be worked on. Otherwise. it was a perfect place to stay.,The price was comparative to a stay at a hotel. but had the comforts of home. Everyone had their own space for downtime.
Two-Bedroom on Milk Street Apt 5B,Daniel,United States of America,1 review,August 15  2017,7.5,AC was difficult to control; the bed needed fitted sheets; the street noise woke us up at 2AM,Great location to see the city and to take a break in the middle of the day.
Two-Bedroom on Milk Street Apt 5B,Great,United States of America,3 Reviews,April 23  2017,9.2,It felt completely odd to not have a single interaction with a human. Even a text from someone saying "did you get in ok? Is there anything you need or any recommendations for dining etc?" Also. the parking suggestion at a nearby garage was way more expensive than mentioned was quoted as $40/day and we paid $60 the first day and $75 the next. Ouch.,The directions were spot on and couldn't have been easier to find. use the codes and you're in! Would have been nice to have a little more information about the area... Grocery stores. where to park. attractions etc.

Four Seasons Boston,Elyse,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 4  2017,9.2,Our room wasn't ready. even after I had pre-registered. We arrived at 5;15 PM and it was not ready until 6;30 in the evening and we had dinner reservations at 7:30. Your room is not cleaned until around 4 PM if one doesn't specifically ask for a more convenient time. Also. the concierge did not comply with our request when ordering a rental car. The manager came out to apologize to us when we were checking out.,N/A

Four Seasons Boston,Wade,United States of America,5 Reviews,August 29  2017,10,Nothing to report here.,Like always the staff is what really makes the difference. After the first day the staff will know you by name. It really is amazing. Everything else was great.......it's the Four Seasons!!
Four Seasons Boston,Laura,United States of America,1 review,August 6  2017,9.6,Ice bucket from previous guest was left in room- full of water.  That was concerning to me as it wasn't clean and my daughter has a severe peanut allergy which I noted on reservation.  I didn't use the ice bucket.  The rooms were both warm (we booked 2 rooms) as if the air conditioning wasn't working well.  We did have to request turn down service on the second room while it came automatically on the first room.  I had to wait for the key by the pool for a while for our second room but the kind fitness attendant offered to go retrieve it for me.,Beds were nice!  Restaurant staff was great about my daughter's peanut allergy.  Staff offered to remove nut items from mini bar.
Four Seasons Boston,Antony,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,June 28  2017,8.3,the management and organisation is a bit lacking.  Had to call on 2 days in a row to get room cleaned after having been out from 8am to 3pm.  Also very hard to get a taxi - plenty outside other hotels but not this one.  They blame Uber but not sure why it only affects them,Its a great building in great condition and a good location.  The staff are friendly and helpful.
Four Seasons Boston,Jill,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,June 11  2017,5.8,The hotel ring fenced our credit card for 5 days after our stay for the same amount of money that we payed for our stay ! Which meant they tied up 2 amounts of money from our card . That's $5500 payment and another $7500 to hold the rooms !!!!!!!!which meant our credit card was blocked ! They could not unlock the ring fenced hold money as it was a WEEKEND !!!! Such bad service over the phone ...very unhelpful. Never will we stay with Four Seasons hotels anywhere .,N/A

I do not expect such a treatment in a 5 starts hotel.,N/A
Four Seasons Boston,Hassan,Saudi Arabia,2 Reviews,November 1  2016,6.7,Old furniture and there is no sound insoulation,The hotel location is right on the park. But it's furniture is a bit outdated for four seasons hotel and value
Four Seasons Boston,Lauren,United Kingdom,11 Reviews,August 9  2016,10,N/A,The staff were excellent and efficient. The location of the hotel is great. It is not over modern and has some old world charm which we liked. The beds were VERY comfortable. We will go back. They were great in negotiating a slightly later check out time for us to comply with our flight time and that made a huge difference to us.
Four Seasons Boston,Laura,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 8  2016,7.1,See above,I will admit the hotel manager was so nice. In spite of  of the room mistake .Due to the fault of both booking. Com and FS  hotel we were supposed to have two beds in the room  for me and my daughter .  That room was given away thus as a favor they gave  us a "upgrade"of a room with a horrible pullout couch .  After driving in traffic for eight hours. who feels like arguing with either booking. Com (who puts you on hold forever)or the four seasons .I also had to ask for more towels. shampoo and soap and there was only one bath robe .  I hate that !!!Both B.com and FS should have rectified the mistake by comping  us a extra room in good faith..  Period !!!!It's actually a small cost to eat rathar than lose a client and further referrals.This is when I reconsider using travel sites  like booking.com again .This was a $800 room and you shouldn't haggle with good repeat clients like myself . There was good service .  However the room and dining room and bar were underwhelming and did not exude the elegance that they used to be know for .I've heard the battery park FS is not great either .  If you were a smart  business you would value my patronage over the years and Comp me my next hotel reservation .Otherwise  I have no reason to book with B.com again.   Would you ??
Four Seasons Boston,BigSav,United Arab Emirates,9 Reviews,July 13  2016,7.5,There was a prayer mat and Quran kept on our bed ... Not sure whether this was intentional. if it was then staff need to know that not everyone arriving from UAE is Muslim!! We wanted to use the house limousine service but staff responsible are not very helpful.,Good Location. We arrived after a 14hour flight and requested an early check-in which was honored. This was a very positive way to start out vacation and the gesture is much appreciated. Room was clean and comfortable and housekeeping staff were very attentive to our needs. Buffet breakfast was excellent.

We walked everywhere. loved it.
Longfellow Place Apartment by Stay Alfred,David,United States of America,1 review,October 16  2017,6.7,Bed and pillows were horrible. I did not get one good night's sleep. Window blinds were broken.

Longfellow Place Apartment by Stay Alfred,Janice,United Kingdom,1 review,October 6  2017,7.9,Decor is a little tired. lots of blown light bulbs (one gone in most rooms). some broken slats in blinds (which were being repaired as we left. so hopefully this problem is sorted).,Lots of space in this 3 bedroom apartment - two bathrooms and 3 toilets!

Longfellow Place Apartment by Stay Alfred,Hollie,United Kingdom,18 Reviews,August 21  2017,10,There is no onsite parking and parking nearby is EXPENSIVE. We had to pay $30 per 24 hours at the car park next door.,The apartment was huge and had everything we needed plus it was very clean. The sofa bed had broken before we got there but we explained to the company and they offered to bring in a replacement bed but we only stayed for two nights so it wasn't necessary. The location was brilliant. great location for some good runs down the river and also not far from the beginning of the Freedom Trail. We didn't use public transport at all other than to go and see Harvard. We will definitely go back to Boston and would love to stay here.

Longfellow Place Apartment by Stay Alfred,Chad,United States of America,1 review,July 6  2017,8.3,The pillows are as hard as rocks - but it's impossible to meet everyone's taste. It could use a really good deep clean. Corners have accumulated and the vent covers in bathrooms are completely covered with dust. There was a bad smell in the hallway and master bedroom - enough to make me buy air freshener.  I would have really liked a discount on parking.,The view was amazing. The bedrooms are big and plenty of storage. It is centrally located for all fun stuff in Boston. We only needed a car to/from airport - because there are 5 of us and to go to Salem one day. Super close to Whole Foods - an easy walk.  Family room furniture is adequate. Kitchen is well stocked. It is super nice to have laundry available.
Longfellow Place Apartment by Stay Alfred,Melicig,United States of America,6 Reviews,July 4  2017,10,A/C was dated and a bit noisy,Spacious apartment for our family group. Also. location. location. location! We had easy access to the T (metro). to restaurants. and to attractions - so convenient!
Longfellow Place Apartment by Stay Alfred,Anthony,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,June 28  2017,10,Just a slight problem with the wooden flooring near the air conditioning units was was slightly raised. and we think this may have been due to a leak in the air condition unit beneath the flooring in both the bedrooms,It was so much better for us to book an apartment since we had two family members with us and they could also have their privacy
Longfellow Place Apartment by Stay Alfred,Marcia,United States of America,1 review,June 26  2017,7.5,The AC in the master did not work. Needed ability to get a parking space. There is nowhere near by to get tours and without access to print online purchase you could not utilize the stops nearby.,The place was very roomy and had everything you could need.
Longfellow Place Apartment by Stay Alfred,Janet,United States of America,1 review,June 22  2017,10,The only downfall is that there weren't that many family friendly restaurants nearby.  We just walked a bit further!,This location was close to everything and easy to find when returning from a trek across Boston!  It was comfortable and way better than a hotel!!!  The view was great!  You can see the harbor.
Longfellow Place Apartment by Stay Alfred,Babushka87,Pakistan,12 Reviews,May 17  2017,7.5,Apt needs a bit updating. the fixtures and bulbs need to be changed. Drain was a bit backed up.

Decent gym.
Longfellow Place Apartment by Stay Alfred,Bill UK,United Kingdom,33 Reviews,May 15  2017,6.3,While clean. it wasn't well decorated inside and had a tired look to the place. One of the windows had blown which looked sad. The heating was very noisy so had to be switched off at night. there's more admin (sending copies of passport etc) than I wanted and when I tried to book an extra night the overnight price went up significantly from the original booking so I declined the offer and changed my plans.,Location was good with a great shop just over the road. Accommodation was large comfortable and had the facilities needed.  It was clean and being on floor 27 had a great view.

No facility for luggage storage when we had a night time flight. even though there is 24 hour concierge.,Location very good.
Longfellow Place Apartment by Stay Alfred,Anonymous,Taiwan,55 Reviews,April 18  2017,7.9,-heater was not working for one of the bedrooms. therefore was freezing cold at night.-was being offered free laundry quota ($30) through confirmation email but ended up there was only $1.40 in the laundry card; we had to pay for doing our own laundry,-the location was okay. ideal for a longer stay. most of the places are within walkable distance-the apartment is really spacious with most of the facility you need in the kitchen
Longfellow Place Apartment by Stay Alfred,Marek,Slovakia,17 Reviews,April 13  2017,9.2,The apartments do not provide luggage storage. I'm aware that the building reception is not dedicated to the Stay Alfred only. but it would be nice if travelers would be allowed to leave the luggage at the reception for couple of hours. Parking slot would be also a nice to have. The apartment is a bit expensive. But we were informed about all of those things in advance. so it wasn't a surprise. Despite that. I would definitely recommend this property to everyone.,The apartment is simply perfect. Great location. small shop located just a few steps from the apartment. few minutes of walking from bars. restaurants. subway. city center or TD Garden. A lot of space for 7 people. amazing view from 36th floor. it's really quiet in the property.

Longfellow Place Apartment by Stay Alfred,Ho,Hong Kong,1 review,June 19  2016,5.8,1. No cable signal (signal box is found missing) for tv and wifii. ie the room is not checked ready before guest checkin. 2 TV was finally set on the second day only after being pressed by making calls to them. but wifi service was found poor in service. no service in most of the time. Tv and wifi are basic. but not complimentary (as what the said) facilities. 3. I did not realise there was no on site staff at booking.com until they confirmed booking after I booked and  paid the deposit (non refundable). It is only a private flat bit not a whole block service apt.  It was tremenous bad when we arrived early at 1:30pm as we had made an early check in request through booking.com. The message has been shown in the confirmation from them as well but no rejection message was reveived. We had made calls to them twice but the customer service said they had not received such message. We finallly waited at lobby for 1 and half hours with our big luggages after a long travel. 4. Photos of the apartment (very bright and in modern deign) showed in booking.com looked different form the unit we stayed. furniture and kitchen were good but the flooring was old styled and the closets and curtains were all tear and wear. Need refurblishment.,Kitchen is well.
Longfellow Place Apartment by Stay Alfred,Jennifer,Germany,3 Reviews,June 13  2016,7.1,However. swimming pool is listed as one of the amenities. and it turned out in the end. that this was not included as part of our stay (front desk said that Stay Alfred. who runs the apartment. never paid for pool access/ FOB). My husband stood in front of the pool door for about 15 minutes with the four kids in bathing suits. wondering why we did not have access with our cards. while I ran to the front desk to inquire (in my bathing suit) -- turns out this is an additional amenity which is not included as part of the stay (says seasonal on the website for the pool. but June is certainly the season given that all the other guests that had access to it). Also. two of us fell off the dining chairs (I am 55 kg and my husband 75kg) while eating dinner because the vast majority of the dining chairs were broken/ shaky/ with loose legs. Overall. I would still recommend this for the space and the view. but would be sure to ask first about the pool access and be careful abou the pieces of furniture befor using.,We are a family of six and we really loved the view and the space - 36th floor. great view of Boston. super close to Science Museum. and enough space for everyone to hang out. TV program options were fantastic. Kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed. WIFI awesome. We checked out 20 minutes later than expected. and were not given any problems.
Longfellow Place Apartment by Stay Alfred,Santiago,United States of America,1 review,June 13  2016,9.6,N/A,Very nice &amp; clean and more than enough room for us four. Beautiful view and great location. Comfortable and felt safe in this facility.  Thank you. thank you. thank you!
Longfellow Place Apartment by Stay Alfred,David,United States of America,5 Reviews,June 10  2016,9.2,The apartment was not ready when we arrived at 3pm and the concierge did very little to resolve a delayed check-in.  The AC units in the apartment did not work well even though there was a wall unit in each room.  Thankfully it was cool outside with a nice breeze so we opened the windows.,The apartment was very spacious and comfortable.  The view is simply incredible and the location is perfect for visiting the North End and Fanuiel Hall as both are within walking distance.  The amenities such as the fitness facility and pool area are very nice.  Overall it was a lot of bang for the buck - especially if you are a traveling family of 4-5 people.
Longfellow Place Apartment by Stay Alfred,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,May 26  2016,6.3,Apartment is outdated ....bathroom space is small. no hooks to hang clothes in bathroom. sink counter tops are small for hygiene products. limited tv channels. dusty carpet.

Provided a card for laundry in basement.

Longfellow Place Apartment by Stay Alfred,Fernando,Uruguay,9 Reviews,April 14  2016,9.6,All was great,Everything was beyond expectations. The location and amenities were wonderful. Really quiet location. 10 minutes away from Faneuil Hall and financial district.it's was a 2 bedroom apartment and as I was on a business travel by myself. I just used the king size bed. The master bedroom was incredible. and it was snowing in Boston (which was weird for this time of year) so I used the heating which worked perfectly. Bathroom comfortable and with more than enough towels. with shampoo and more. I bought my groceries on the Whole Foods 2 blocks away. so this is also a plus for me too. Big kitchen on the apartment. all was clean and it lacked anything. This is for sure the place for my next stay in Boston. I couldn't be more satisfied.
Longfellow Place Apartment by Stay Alfred,Diane,Australia,8 Reviews,March 31  2016,10,everything was perfect!,The apartment was spotless. extremely well equipped and very tastefully decorated.

Longfellow Place Apartment by Stay Alfred,James,United States of America,1 review,March 18  2016,9.6,Somehow we thought that the pool was indoor. which it isn't. Bummer as it was March!

We were able to easily use the T line to get around Boston and go to the Children's Museum. which is awesome!

The entire apartment is awesome. it's both functional and good-looking. The free parking included is perfect for people moving by car. Best place to stay. right in the middle of the city.

Wanted to get a hotel room in Boston for five people and found this amazing apartment located very close to the Boston Garden.  Price was great. apt lovely &amp; spacious - two beds and two baths for price of one hotel room. Beds were very comfy and had lots of pillows. Easy to find and assess through the concierge.  Got a parking pass for lot right under building. Friends in the city came by to watch the game and were quite impressed. Even had pizza delivered! Would definitely use Stay Alfred in the future!!

Longfellow Place Apartment by Stay Alfred,Kristen,United States of America,1 review,January 14  2016,8.3,When I checked in the person at the desk had no knowledge of my reservation. When he looked up my room he couldn't find my information and my room was under someone else's name. He said it happens a lot. I enjoyed my stay. Only thing I think is unreasonable is the cleaning fee. We are responsible for the majority of the cleaning (removing and disposing of all trash. washing all dishes). $100+ is high amount to make beds and wipe down countertops,The location of the hotel was very convenient. The apartment was fully stocked with everything you needed to cook with during your stay. Loved the indoor playground.

Seaport Boston Hotel,Lyn,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,November 1  2017,9.2,Area is still under development but has potential.,The room and facilities were excellent.  Close to metro/bus station and cruise terminal. but a bit of a walk to some parts of the city.  Otherwise a perfect place to stay.  Not too noisy or busy.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,16 Reviews,October 30  2017,7.5,It is unconscionably expensive. We were there for a conference and the cost of the accommodation was utterly unreasonable and that was without breakfast. It is simply unjustifiable and pure profiteering. It is a fair trek from downtown.,The staff were very friendly. The room was clean. beds were comfortable and the shower was good. The swimming pool was smallish but warm. The WiFi was good.

Seaport Boston Hotel,Maureen,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 16  2017,7.1,It is in the southern part of Boston which for walking purposes to the center of town is not convenient.,Staff was amazing.  We also had room service which was prompt and food delivered hot.  This hotel is also very close to the silver line for the subway which was very convenient.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Charles,United States of America,1 review,October 15  2017,5.4,Toilet broken and wouldn't flush contents.  Maintenance called. Supposedly fixed problem but it happened again for 2nd day in a row as well.  Not a pleasant experience.  In room safe failed to operate.  Had to get technician to remove old batteries and install new.   Shower has pressure problems .. good pressure then almost off then good again.  Maybe that and toilet can be fixed before next guest gets room 836.,Comfortable bed. quiet room. harbor view but you have to pay a good premium to get it.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Sabrina,Switzerland,12 Reviews,October 14  2017,7.9,In the hotel is a coffee-"corner". but the prices are too expansive and the offers are quite limited and not that good. for this size of the hotel!,Modern part of the city.

Seaport Boston Hotel,Tobias,United States of America,18 Reviews,October 4  2017,7.5,N/A,It is a huge hotel with a lot of rooms but everything is well designed and thought out.

Seaport Boston Hotel,Courtney,United States of America,5 Reviews,October 2  2017,10,I can't think of anything.,The room was tasteful and extremely comfortable. and the layout was very homey and relaxing. We also enjoyed taking a swim in the pool. It was really clean and modern. The staff. from the doorman to the clerk at the desk to the man who brought us extra coffee-- everyone was down to earth and gracious. Thank you for a wonderful stay!
Seaport Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 2  2017,6.7,Our room. #825. was very noisy due to proximity to elevator.  Did not enjoy a restful night of sleep at all.  The associate at the front desk was not very welcoming -- just went through her duties and answered a couple of questions rather cryptically.  Did the job -- but not with a pleasant. welcoming attitude.,Room was modern and clean; robes were a nice touch.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Michael,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 1  2017,7.1,A very expensive hotel (room only) that is at least 1 mile from the main areas and sights of Boston.  I felt the room albeit pleasant was a little dated in terms of decor.  Not the best selection of TV channels to watch. Based on all of the above I'm not convinced the hotel represented value for money based on other hotels I stayed at during my in the USA.,Very comfy bed.  Clean and spacious rooms.  In room tea and coffee was nice.  Complementary newspaper (limited choice of 2 papers) to choose from. In room I ron and ironing board to use.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Tracey,United States of America,1 review,September 29  2017,10,N/A,The accommodations are extremely comfortable and clean. The room includes a SMART television with internet access and apps for convenience.  The shower includes a massage component for extra luxury.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Linda,United States of America,1 review,September 28  2017,6.7,The bed was so uncomfortable. it hurt my hips and I tossed and turned all night.  It was like a rock.  And the pillows were the worst I've ever had in a hotel.  Very lumpy.  P.S.  I 've never complained about a hotel before and these were the only complaints about this place.,N/A
Seaport Boston Hotel,Julie,United States of America,7 Reviews,September 26  2017,10,I sent my daughter and new husband there for their wedding night.  I had pre-arranged payment. had sent a credit card authorization form ahead of time.  Still when they arrived they were made to feel very uncomfortable while the person at the check in desk called me and asked for confirmation of all the details of the form I'd sent in.  I had just walked in from the wedding. had no access to a computer. and still had to provide details while my poor daughter and husband sat and waited. still in their wedding clothes!,N/A
Seaport Boston Hotel,Joseph,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,September 26  2017,9.6,I thought the cost of parking was rather expensive. but I suppose that's par for the course for the area.

Super bed. the staff were very obliging and friendly.especially the concierge. she was really special.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 24  2017,10,The cost was in line for the area the hotel is in.,The registration staff made me feel very welcome. and even took my bag personally to the room.

Seaport Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 23  2017,9.6,Dinner Restaurant menu too limited.  Not enough healthy food.  Lots or restaurants nearby. though.,Air purifier in room which was super for this allergy sufferer.  Great location &amp; really comfy bed!  And we liked the "service included". Maybe that is why all staff were so pleasant &amp; helpful.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Bernard,Australia,5 Reviews,September 22  2017,7.5,N/A,Well run hotel.  Extremely helpful concierge staff and check-in staff.  Nicely furnished room with good views. Close to many restaurants / bars and easy walk in downtown Boston.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Geraldine,Ireland,31 Reviews,September 18  2017,9.6,A slight negative is that the property is a little far from central Boston. Possible to walk into the centre in 25/30 minutes or to get public transport as the Silver line to South station is across the road from the hotel.,The quality of the fittings and furniture in the rooms and public areas was excellent.Staff were excellent. No tipping policy made life easy (tips are included in prices)The area surrounding the hotel is newly developed and undergoing continued building but there is a great buzz in the evenings with many fun pubs and good restaurants around. Also has a great indoor pool.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 17  2017,9.6,It's expensive. Would be better value if parking and breakfast included.,Perfect location to walk to waterfront restaurants and bars before and after shows at Blue Hill Pavillion

Seaport Boston Hotel,Scott,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,September 9  2017,10,I am nit picking here. room could be bigger for family rooms. maybe some bunk beds as the twin double beds were a bit on the small side.  For a family of four with luggage it makes things a bit tight on space.,Wow. what a beautiful hotel. totally knocked back how nice this hotel was. Can't really fault it. staff were fantastic and great with my children. The food was excellent and reasonably priced for hotel prices. Myself and my wife love Boston as we stayed there on honeymoon so when we visit Boston again we will be coming back here!!!
Seaport Boston Hotel,Geoffrey,United States of America,1 review,September 7  2017,9.2,Although it was a fabulous experience. it was a bit expensive.,The front staff were outstanding.  They were available. knowledgeable. courteous. and funny!
Seaport Boston Hotel,Georgina,United Kingdom,22 Reviews,September 5  2017,10,N/A,We stayed here twice during our stay. The Seaport area is interesting and full of new development. It was good to be away from the hubbub of Downtown.  The staff were professional and friendly. the rooms were lovely. both with a view of the harbour. Access to the location is great as it's on a direct mentor link from the airport. and to all other metro stations. It is also right next to the ferry station for access to various islands.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Jackie,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,September 4  2017,9.6,Nothing. Only thing I didn't like was not being able to stay longer than a night as we left for airport next day.,Very large room. friendly and helpful staff. Great facilities.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Thomas,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 4  2017,9.6,Deluxe King room was quite small. water temperature for shower is too hot. If a child turned it on they could be scalded ! Automaticly Adding gratuity to all Resturant bills is not appropriate. price for overnight parking or auto is the highest in the city.,Hotel was very clean and up to date on fixturing and decor. Staff was very accommodating.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Darcie,Australia,9 Reviews,September 4  2017,9.2,Not a lot to do around the seaport area unless you are taking a boat tour but it is a very long walk to any shops or a 15 minute walk to the market area.,The rooms are gorgeous. very comfortable and make you feel like your at home. Very nice interior. Lovely hotel.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Andrew,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,September 4  2017,7.9,Nothing - all OK.,Good sized room with comfortable bed. Staff were very friendly and approachable. Breakfast buffet was great. And no tipping required!
Seaport Boston Hotel,Daniel,United Kingdom,10 Reviews,September 2  2017,7.9,Bed was too soft for our liking which.unfortunately. meant we didn't get an excellent night's sleep. The air conditioning was faulty or didn't work which meant that the room was quite stuffy.Location about 20 minutes walk away from main Boston but OK if you are happy using the Underground.,Execellent mini bar and tea and coffee facilities in the rooms.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Nicola,United Kingdom,17 Reviews,August 31  2017,10,N/A,The hotel is extremely clean. comfortable and well located.  All the staff are excellent.  The restaurant outside cooked amazing kebabs!  We would certainly stay here again.  There was a free shuttle bus from the airport - although with roadworks in the tunnel we would recommend going via tube - very easy!
Seaport Boston Hotel,Michelle,United States of America,6 Reviews,August 25  2017,9.6,N/A,Staff was wonderful.  I liked the "no tipping" policy.  It worked for us as all staff was very accommodating. Breakfast was good.  Rooms were a nice size and very clean.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Jane,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,August 24  2017,10,The air conditioning in the room was a tad noisy but would not stop me from returning to the hotel.,The hotel had recently been refurbished so carpets and furniture were all new and clean.  The room was bright and airy due to the large window and good lighting and a comfortable bed and pillows.  The bathroom was also well thought through with many different lights and make up and shaving mirrors.  Good shower and plenty of towels and robes!Staff were very professional but still friendly and went out of their way to please - the hotel is a no tips hotel so they were not doing it for the extra money. we did offer a tip a couple of times and both were turned down!The hotel is within easy walking distance to the train/tube and just across the road is the harbour with a lovely fish restaurant and roof bar. a Mexican restaurant and bar and a whiskey tasting bar - all with balconies overlooking the sea. We didn't use the pool so cannot comment on the spa and leisure facilities but. if like the rest of the hotel. they will be good.We picked up a hire car at the end of our stay but there is a large underground car park at the hotel however I don't think it would be cost effective to keep a car in Boston for several days - public transport and walking are the best way round it and parking costs are high everywhere.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Melissa,United States of America,1 review,August 24  2017,6.3,Housekeeping &amp; Reservations/ Front Desk were totally slack. For $400 a night rooms should be cleansed promptly and their should not be any billing issues. Plus they almost lost our luggage when we left it with Front Desk staff after we checked out. Seems like their operations need to tighten up.,Great location and pretty hotel.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Noah,United States of America,1 review,August 23  2017,9.2,Rooms were a bit small and I had trouble keeping the room cold.,I enjoyed the free wifi and the customer service. Namely the helpfulness while maintaining a no tipping policy.  Also enjoyed trips to the free health spa and the pool.
Seaport Boston Hotel,George,United States of America,6 Reviews,August 22  2017,10,Leaving.....,Samantha greeted us at the front desk sign in and assigned us our room. She was ever so pleasant and an excellent "point" person to serve as the hotel "greeter". Bailey. in the cocktail lounge area checked on us throughout our stay. Carl. our Tamo waiter. was a "delight" and the food in the restaurant was simply delicious. A traveler could not want for more. especially with the 24/7 pool and fitness centers. This trip was simply wonderful and the Seaport organization is very fortunate to have such excellent personnel. We'll be back soon!  Thanks.   The Cassidy's
Seaport Boston Hotel,Kathleen,United States of America,1 review,August 22  2017,9.6,Wish the sofa in our room faced the window instead of backing up to it. had to kneel on it or stand to see a great view of the harbor.,Bed and pillows extremely comfy.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Sue,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 18  2017,9.0,Breakfast buffet was good and service again great tho pancakes and eggs benedict had been sitting for awhile,Staff very helpful and genuinely friendly. Loved the nice touches like small task lught attached to headboard. Contemporary yet warm decor. Not cheap but very nice and very close to silverline transit to airport.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Philip,United Kingdom,23 Reviews,August 16  2017,9.6,N/A,Sadly. it was only an overnight stay. We chose it for its proximity to the airport as we had a flight the following day. We opted to pay for the hotels breakfast which was excellent. Plenty of choice. Being next to Boston's waterfront. we found a nice restaurant for dinner nearby. overlooking the harbour. I wish we could have stayed longer!
Seaport Boston Hotel,Kera,United States of America,1 review,August 15  2017,10,I could have been told that there was a pool so I would have packed a bathing suit,The bed was very comfortable. I also liked the extra fluffy blanket provided.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Patrick,Switzerland,7 Reviews,August 15  2017,8.3,N/A,- ideally located in an area where new restaurants and hotels are popping up- 10 mins walk to Aquarium- extremely friendly staff. surprised our kids with a little present and a treasure hunt- rooms are clean and have all features you would ask for
Seaport Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 15  2017,6.7,We spent extra money for the 'ritzy' hotel. Half the charging ports were broken. pool hours closing was too early (did not get to enjoy). cable channel package was primitive and parking should have been included with the stay.,It was safe. Check in was quick.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Natalie,Ireland,1 review,August 12  2017,7.5,Concierge staff could have been a bit more helpful and friendly.,No tipping policy-made it very straightforward as European visitors. Restaurant staff very good. went out of their way to be helpful.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Gaye,United States of America,1 review,August 11  2017,10,Longer hours at the café would have been nice - couldn't do a mid afternoon Starbucks break without leaving the property.,This is a "service inclusive" hotel meaning that guests do not tip (although there is a service charge). The level of service was above and beyond hotels of a similar class where tipping for everything is expected.
Seaport Boston Hotel,JudyBMaine,United States of America,1 review,August 11  2017,10,I booked the room in my name and used my credit card - but it was in their computer under my husband's name (we have different last names).  Happily I brought the confirmation with number. but if I hadn't. I think they would not have been able to find my prepaid reservation - booked through you folks.  So I don't know how you transmit information. but I think that needs improving.,There seemed to be a real commitment to being a "green" property.  I liked the master switch that let us turn off all the lights when we left the room. and turn them all on when we returned.  Good view with a bit of water visible.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Charlotte,United Kingdom,1 review,August 10  2017,10,The double beds were just slightly too small for two,Clean. comfortable rooms in a great location. Enjoyed the use of the pool and gym.Dinner in the restaurant was delicious and very reasonably priced
Seaport Boston Hotel,Paul,United Arab Emirates,5 Reviews,August 9  2017,9.6,Nothing,Just finished our stay at the Seaport hotel in Boston. Hotel is conviently located to public transport (silver line) but also very walkable to most of the major tourist attractions 15 mins to tea party museum and 30 mins to Boston common. Weather was good so we walked most of the time but the public transport is there as an option. Facilities in the hotel were excellent. smart tv. plenty of usb charging ports also so handy for international travellers without American adapters. room was large and comfortable with a great view over the Seaport. Also spotlessly clean!! They also had a business centre with free printing which was very convenient. Matt in reservations was great. we were honeymooning and had informed hotel so they graciously upgraded our room and we arrived to a bottle of prosecco. Also a message on the phone from Matt personally welcoming us to the hotel and congratulating us which was a very nice touch. Would highly recommend this hotel for anyone planning a trip to Boston.

Seaport Boston Hotel,Ar,United States of America,1 review,August 7  2017,8.8,All the extra fees.The total I was quoted on booking after taxes and fees was incorrect. when I got to the hotel. Plus there is a $37.00 fee for parking (per day. per vehicle) It would have been helpful. if the booking website had included this information before hand.,The hotel over all was Gorgeous.The location was very convenient for walking around.We choose this hotel because it was in walking distance to the Boston Harbor Pavilion. In fact it's about a 5-7 minute walk! The staff were Awesome! Everyone from the Bell Hop to the Front Desk. to the Restaurant Staff. all so pleasant. cheerful and patient !My only real complaint with the hotel. is that I didn't get to spend much time in it. to enjoy everything that it had to offer. Something I hope to rectify. as I plan on staying here again in the future.Especially for music events at the Pavilion!
Seaport Boston Hotel,Wanderinghen,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 7  2017,8.8,Breakfast was pricy,Upon arrival with kids there is a Treasure Chest &amp; a welcome bag. Great way to start! All the staff were very accommodating &amp; friendly.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Kenneth,United Kingdom,1 review,August 6  2017,9.6,Fixed shower head over bath. Prefer flexible type. Rooms not to the usual American size being smaller than what we have experienced in other American hotels. although this could just be a city thing.,Clean and tidy. Well presented. Coffee/tea facilities.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Ashley,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 31  2017,9.2,The hotel parking is highly priced ($37 a day) and the room was warm. It had a thermostat but it didn't kick on and work as well as I am used to at hotels.,The room was very nice and the staff were all very friendly. At checkin they gave my daughters a goody bag and a stuffed animal (that made a late night much better in their opinion). The beds were very comfortable. having a small refrigerator in the room was helpful. and overall our experience there was a great one. Also. free wifi and being told at moment one of checkin that tipping of staff isn'( needed because those costs have been rolled into their overall pricing was nice.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Susan,United Kingdom,1 review,July 31  2017,10,N/A,Hotel is situated in a great area. Felt very safe walking around the harbour in the evening with my children. Lots of families. couples. groups of friends doing the same thing!
Seaport Boston Hotel,Tracey,Canada,3 Reviews,July 30  2017,9.6,N/A,Staff were excellent and very accommodating . Rooms had all amenities and we had a beautiful view of the harbour. Location is excellent for exploring the harbour area. Lovely patio area to enjoy a cocktail and people watch .
Seaport Boston Hotel,Ken,Australia,1 review,July 30  2017,7.5,Bathroom ventilation marginal. A bit far away from the action. exacerbated by all the construction at the moment.,Good size clean room. Nice wide hallways. Staff were extremely considerate and helpful. Illi in the breakfast room and the doormen/bellboys were particularly good..
Seaport Boston Hotel,KikiJO,United States of America,9 Reviews,July 28  2017,10,The delivery food options (but I am not complaining).,This was my second visit at the Seaport and I was even more impressed with the customer service. overall accomadation and care. My children (6.5 and 2) love this hotel!! We will stay at the Seaport with every Boston visit.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Michael,United States of America,1 review,July 25  2017,9.2,There were fruit flies flying around in the Bar area. we encountered them on 2 different occasions.,Had a quick lunch in the bar. The Hamburger was awesome.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Tracie,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 25  2017,10,The actual entrance to the hotel could have been better marked.  We ended up at a side entrance on the 2nd floor (where the ballroom is) and it looked like the lobby entrance but wasn't.  Sort of confusing after you've taken a red eye flight!,We had a King room and they put a roll away bed in for our son.  Sadly they had us in an accessible room (due to the early hour of our arrival).  Because of this the bathroom was larger but the actual bedroom was smaller making the addition of the roll away bed a terrible bother.The room was nice though and the automated curtains were great.  The restaurant serving breakfast and I guess lunch seemed to be closed whenever we went by.  I think our hours just didn't sync with their operating hours.  We did eat at the other restaurant and it was great!  It's nice that it's a service inclusive hotel.  The Concierge was instrumental in helping us get last minute seats on a whale watching excursion.Location was great.  Walking to most places was easy. bus or trolley stops were close as well.Not a bad thing to say about this hotel.  We'll be back!
Seaport Boston Hotel,Aimee,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 24  2017,8.8,Rates are a little higher than I expected.,We especially enjoyed the great staff at Tamo--especially Gio (?)  My husband and I arrived late from the airport Friday night and he made sure we were able to have something to eat before the kitchen closed.  He could not have been nicer!Also. we were able to check out late. which was a huge help because we were heading out to an event at 12:45 and could stay in the room until then.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Michael,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 24  2017,6.7,My room was looking at buildings not the harbor. While checking out I was told I was all set to go and then the parking attendant told me I had to go back in because my ticket was not working and made me late to pick up my son,N/A
Seaport Boston Hotel,Kelly,United States of America,1 review,July 23  2017,7.9,N/A,This was just a so so place. not great but not bad either. I would stay here again. The one thing that I did like about it is the location was awesome! Close to a bunch of tourist attractions
Seaport Boston Hotel,Virginia,United States of America,1 review,July 22  2017,10,No complaints,Very clean!housekeeping very good!hotel staff very helpful! concierge great!Convenient to waterfront and walking distance from trolley tours and Faneuil market with restaurants and shops! Hotel price well worth it!
Seaport Boston Hotel,Lyn,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,November 1  2017,9.2,Area is still under development but has potential.,The room and facilities were excellent.  Close to metro/bus station and cruise terminal. but a bit of a walk to some parts of the city.  Otherwise a perfect place to stay.  Not too noisy or busy.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,16 Reviews,October 30  2017,7.5,It is unconscionably expensive. We were there for a conference and the cost of the accommodation was utterly unreasonable and that was without breakfast. It is simply unjustifiable and pure profiteering. It is a fair trek from downtown.,The staff were very friendly. The room was clean. beds were comfortable and the shower was good. The swimming pool was smallish but warm. The WiFi was good.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Lynda,South Africa,1 review,October 30  2017,6.3,The fridge was faulty Needed  to repeat complaint for them to supply a new fridge which occupied a large part if the roomRoom only supplied a coffee machine One was unable to make tea,Bed was comfortable Location goof
Seaport Boston Hotel,Annmarie,United States of America,1 review,October 29  2017,9.2,The view for the money should have been nicer. I had to go to one corner in the room to see the water,It was chilly and I was traveling alone so I ate at the hotel. The hotel facilities were pretty and comfortable. Very convenient
Seaport Boston Hotel,Heidi,United States of America,9 Reviews,October 28  2017,10,N/A,Maria at the Front Desk is awesome.  We arrived after flying a red-eye overnight and tired.  She had our room ready fast and was able to check us in early.  Valet took care of car and luggage delivered to room quickly.  All the Staff were friendly and helpful.  Room was lovely. comfortable bed so nice for a afternoon nap :-) after a long night traveling.  Shower is Spa like.  We walked much of the city and had a great time. so much to see.  Really enjoyed the Harborview from room and just watching the sailboats. ferries and planes go by too.  Great place to stay!
Seaport Boston Hotel,Nancy,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 28  2017,9.6,N/A,my waiter comped my breakfast when he found out it was my birthday-he also delivered a lovely tray with the words happy birthday and chocolate covered strawberries;-)
Seaport Boston Hotel,Craig,United States of America,1 review,October 28  2017,9.6,It was just pricey. but it was .7 miles from where I needed to be that weekend so it worked out,Awesome window room with wonderful blankets and felt like I was at home....but better
Seaport Boston Hotel,Yong,South Korea,5 Reviews,October 27  2017,9.6,Condition of the roads (hard to get there for the first time visiting driver. The Navigator won't guide well in the tunnel). Surrounding area. Lots of blocks are under construction,Close to BCEC. Nice view. Well arranged room. Kind Clerks.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Eugene,United States of America,1 review,October 25  2017,10,Limited operating times of kiosk for coffee,Front office happily accommodated request change from harbor view room that had partially obstructed view to full view room the next day when the room was available.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,October 20  2017,10,Nothing I can think of.  In the event my wife and I visit Boston in the future. the Seaport Hotel would probably be our first choice.,Very friendly staff. excellent catering and a very helpful Concierge who arranged a number of trips for us.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Christopher,United Kingdom,38 Reviews,October 19  2017,7.5,Being to.d that no tips were required and that everything was included in the price only to find that 18% service charge was added to each checkGarage was expensiveBreakfast room too small for size of hotel &amp; expensiveLocate nice but too far from centre of things,Nice comfortable hotel. large room. very helpful young lady  concierge
Seaport Boston Hotel,Maureen,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 16  2017,7.1,It is in the southern part of Boston which for walking purposes to the center of town is not convenient.,Staff was amazing.  We also had room service which was prompt and food delivered hot.  This hotel is also very close to the silver line for the subway which was very convenient.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Charles,United States of America,1 review,October 15  2017,5.4,Toilet broken and wouldn't flush contents.  Maintenance called. Supposedly fixed problem but it happened again for 2nd day in a row as well.  Not a pleasant experience.  In room safe failed to operate.  Had to get technician to remove old batteries and install new.   Shower has pressure problems .. good pressure then almost off then good again.  Maybe that and toilet can be fixed before next guest gets room 836.,Comfortable bed. quiet room. harbor view but you have to pay a good premium to get it.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Sabrina,Switzerland,12 Reviews,October 14  2017,7.9,In the hotel is a coffee-"corner". but the prices are too expansive and the offers are quite limited and not that good. for this size of the hotel!,Modern part of the city.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Anonymous,Switzerland,5 Reviews,October 12  2017,10,N/A,quiet but very close to convention centre. I used the room service and it was really good. I worked a lot from the hotel and the wifi was free and also worked very well
Seaport Boston Hotel,Anonymous,China,2 Reviews,October 12  2017,10,Nothing,Great location. around 20 minutes walks to the city center. Can see the airport and harbor in the room. The staffs were very friendly and nice. Room was spacious and clean.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Joy,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 9  2017,9.6,It's a bit far from the historical district.,They offer a choice of pillows. I.e. down. down alternative. foam. etc.. free of charge. Rooms are spacious and beautiful.  Kuerig. mini-fridge. real glasswear. wine glasses in the room.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Tobias,United States of America,18 Reviews,October 4  2017,7.5,N/A,It is a huge hotel with a lot of rooms but everything is well designed and thought out. Rooms are very silent so you don't hear the other people. Hotel is a service is included hotel - so no need to tip anyone :)
Seaport Boston Hotel,Jane,United States of America,1 review,October 3  2017,10,N/A,We loved the Hotel! Everyone was Awesome!! Great service.! Samantha at the front desk was WONDERFUL! Elir in the restaurant was the BEST! Will be back for sure!
Seaport Boston Hotel,Courtney,United States of America,5 Reviews,October 2  2017,10,I can't think of anything.,The room was tasteful and extremely comfortable. and the layout was very homey and relaxing. We also enjoyed taking a swim in the pool. It was really clean and modern. The staff. from the doorman to the clerk at the desk to the man who brought us extra coffee-- everyone was down to earth and gracious. Thank you for a wonderful stay!
Seaport Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 2  2017,6.7,Our room. #825. was very noisy due to proximity to elevator.  Did not enjoy a restful night of sleep at all.  The associate at the front desk was not very welcoming -- just went through her duties and answered a couple of questions rather cryptically.  Did the job -- but not with a pleasant. welcoming attitude.,Room was modern and clean; robes were a nice touch.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Michael,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 1  2017,7.1,A very expensive hotel (room only) that is at least 1 mile from the main areas and sights of Boston.  I felt the room albeit pleasant was a little dated in terms of decor.  Not the best selection of TV channels to watch. Based on all of the above I'm not convinced the hotel represented value for money based on other hotels I stayed at during my in the USA.,Very comfy bed.  Clean and spacious rooms.  In room tea and coffee was nice.  Complementary newspaper (limited choice of 2 papers) to choose from. In room I ron and ironing board to use.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Tracey,United States of America,1 review,September 29  2017,10,N/A,The accommodations are extremely comfortable and clean. The room includes a SMART television with internet access and apps for convenience.  The shower includes a massage component for extra luxury.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Linda,United States of America,1 review,September 28  2017,6.7,The bed was so uncomfortable. it hurt my hips and I tossed and turned all night.  It was like a rock.  And the pillows were the worst I've ever had in a hotel.  Very lumpy.  P.S.  I 've never complained about a hotel before and these were the only complaints about this place.,N/A
Seaport Boston Hotel,Julie,United States of America,7 Reviews,September 26  2017,10,I sent my daughter and new husband there for their wedding night.  I had pre-arranged payment. had sent a credit card authorization form ahead of time.  Still when they arrived they were made to feel very uncomfortable while the person at the check in desk called me and asked for confirmation of all the details of the form I'd sent in.  I had just walked in from the wedding. had no access to a computer. and still had to provide details while my poor daughter and husband sat and waited. still in their wedding clothes!,N/A
Seaport Boston Hotel,Joseph,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,September 26  2017,9.6,I thought the cost of parking was rather expensive. but I suppose that's par for the course for the area. Most places we have visited in the States haven't charged for parking.,quiet room. overlooking harbour. Great views over the bay. Super bed. the staff were very obliging and friendly.especially the concierge. she was really special.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 24  2017,10,The cost was in line for the area the hotel is in.,The registration staff made me feel very welcome. and even took my bag personally to the room. The room was very nice. I want to take the shower home! Great view of the Harbor area. Close to the Cruise Departure station.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 23  2017,9.6,Dinner Restaurant menu too limited.  Not enough healthy food.  Lots or restaurants nearby. though.,Air purifier in room which was super for this allergy sufferer.  Great location &amp; really comfy bed!  And we liked the "service included". Maybe that is why all staff were so pleasant &amp; helpful.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Bernard,Australia,5 Reviews,September 22  2017,7.5,N/A,Well run hotel.  Extremely helpful concierge staff and check-in staff.  Nicely furnished room with good views. Close to many restaurants / bars and easy walk in downtown Boston.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Geraldine,Ireland,31 Reviews,September 18  2017,9.6,A slight negative is that the property is a little far from central Boston. Possible to walk into the centre in 25/30 minutes or to get public transport as the Silver line to South station is across the road from the hotel.,The quality of the fittings and furniture in the rooms and public areas was excellent.Staff were excellent. No tipping policy made life easy (tips are included in prices)The area surrounding the hotel is newly developed and undergoing continued building but there is a great buzz in the evenings with many fun pubs and good restaurants around. Also has a great indoor pool.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 17  2017,9.6,It's expensive. Would be better value if parking and breakfast included.,Perfect location to walk to waterfront restaurants and bars before and after shows at Blue Hill Pavillion
Seaport Boston Hotel,Graham,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,September 14  2017,8.8,Expensive but then again quite central in a major city and next door to a top business convention centre.,Comfortable room and friendly. helpful staff.
Seaport Boston Hotel,John,United Kingdom,1 review,September 12  2017,9.6,We got in late and there was no room service. not even a sandwich.,Great location/parking for a Boston stay. lots of local restaurants. etc all walking in a minute or so.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Scott,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,September 9  2017,10,I am nit picking here. room could be bigger for family rooms. maybe some bunk beds as the twin double beds were a bit on the small side.  For a family of four with luggage it makes things a bit tight on space.,Wow. what a beautiful hotel. totally knocked back how nice this hotel was. Can't really fault it. staff were fantastic and great with my children. The food was excellent and reasonably priced for hotel prices. Myself and my wife love Boston as we stayed there on honeymoon so when we visit Boston again we will be coming back here!!!
Seaport Boston Hotel,Geoffrey,United States of America,1 review,September 7  2017,9.2,Although it was a fabulous experience. it was a bit expensive.,The front staff were outstanding.  They were available. knowledgeable. courteous. and funny!
Seaport Boston Hotel,Georgina,United Kingdom,22 Reviews,September 5  2017,10,N/A,We stayed here twice during our stay. The Seaport area is interesting and full of new development. It was good to be away from the hubbub of Downtown.  The staff were professional and friendly. the rooms were lovely. both with a view of the harbour. Access to the location is great as it's on a direct mentor link from the airport. and to all other metro stations. It is also right next to the ferry station for access to various islands.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Jackie,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,September 4  2017,9.6,Nothing. Only thing I didn't like was not being able to stay longer than a night as we left for airport next day.,Very large room. friendly and helpful staff. Great facilities.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Thomas,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 4  2017,9.6,Deluxe King room was quite small. water temperature for shower is too hot. If a child turned it on they could be scalded ! Automaticly Adding gratuity to all Resturant bills is not appropriate. price for overnight parking or auto is the highest in the city.,Hotel was very clean and up to date on fixturing and decor. Staff was very accommodating.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Darcie,Australia,9 Reviews,September 4  2017,9.2,Not a lot to do around the seaport area unless you are taking a boat tour but it is a very long walk to any shops or a 15 minute walk to the market area.,The rooms are gorgeous. very comfortable and make you feel like your at home. Very nice interior. Lovely hotel.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Andrew,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,September 4  2017,7.9,Nothing - all OK.,Good sized room with comfortable bed. Staff were very friendly and approachable. Breakfast buffet was great. And no tipping required!
Seaport Boston Hotel,Daniel,United Kingdom,10 Reviews,September 2  2017,7.9,Bed was too soft for our liking which.unfortunately. meant we didn't get an excellent night's sleep. The air conditioning was faulty or didn't work which meant that the room was quite stuffy.Location about 20 minutes walk away from main Boston but OK if you are happy using the Underground.,Execellent mini bar and tea and coffee facilities in the rooms.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Nicola,United Kingdom,17 Reviews,August 31  2017,10,N/A,The hotel is extremely clean. comfortable and well located.  All the staff are excellent.  The restaurant outside cooked amazing kebabs!  We would certainly stay here again.  There was a free shuttle bus from the airport - although with roadworks in the tunnel we would recommend going via tube - very easy!
Seaport Boston Hotel,Michelle,United States of America,6 Reviews,August 25  2017,9.6,N/A,Staff was wonderful.  I liked the "no tipping" policy.  It worked for us as all staff was very accommodating. Breakfast was good.  Rooms were a nice size and very clean.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Jane,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,August 24  2017,10,The air conditioning in the room was a tad noisy but would not stop me from returning to the hotel.,The hotel had recently been refurbished so carpets and furniture were all new and clean.  The room was bright and airy due to the large window and good lighting and a comfortable bed and pillows.  The bathroom was also well thought through with many different lights and make up and shaving mirrors.  Good shower and plenty of towels and robes!Staff were very professional but still friendly and went out of their way to please - the hotel is a no tips hotel so they were not doing it for the extra money. we did offer a tip a couple of times and both were turned down!The hotel is within easy walking distance to the train/tube and just across the road is the harbour with a lovely fish restaurant and roof bar. a Mexican restaurant and bar and a whiskey tasting bar - all with balconies overlooking the sea. We didn't use the pool so cannot comment on the spa and leisure facilities but. if like the rest of the hotel. they will be good.We picked up a hire car at the end of our stay but there is a large underground car park at the hotel however I don't think it would be cost effective to keep a car in Boston for several days - public transport and walking are the best way round it and parking costs are high everywhere.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Melissa,United States of America,1 review,August 24  2017,6.3,Housekeeping &amp; Reservations/ Front Desk were totally slack. For $400 a night rooms should be cleansed promptly and their should not be any billing issues. Plus they almost lost our luggage when we left it with Front Desk staff after we checked out. Seems like their operations need to tighten up.,Great location and pretty hotel.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Noah,United States of America,1 review,August 23  2017,9.2,Rooms were a bit small and I had trouble keeping the room cold.,I enjoyed the free wifi and the customer service. Namely the helpfulness while maintaining a no tipping policy.  Also enjoyed trips to the free health spa and the pool.
Seaport Boston Hotel,George,United States of America,6 Reviews,August 22  2017,10,Leaving.....,Samantha greeted us at the front desk sign in and assigned us our room. She was ever so pleasant and an excellent "point" person to serve as the hotel "greeter". Bailey. in the cocktail lounge area checked on us throughout our stay. Carl. our Tamo waiter. was a "delight" and the food in the restaurant was simply delicious. A traveler could not want for more. especially with the 24/7 pool and fitness centers. This trip was simply wonderful and the Seaport organization is very fortunate to have such excellent personnel. We'll be back soon!  Thanks.   The Cassidy's
Seaport Boston Hotel,Kathleen,United States of America,1 review,August 22  2017,9.6,Wish the sofa in our room faced the window instead of backing up to it. had to kneel on it or stand to see a great view of the harbor.,Bed and pillows extremely comfy.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Sue,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 18  2017,9.0,Breakfast buffet was good and service again great tho pancakes and eggs benedict had been sitting for awhile,Staff very helpful and genuinely friendly. Loved the nice touches like small task lught attached to headboard. Contemporary yet warm decor. Not cheap but very nice and very close to silverline transit to airport.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Philip,United Kingdom,23 Reviews,August 16  2017,9.6,N/A,Sadly. it was only an overnight stay. We chose it for its proximity to the airport as we had a flight the following day. We opted to pay for the hotels breakfast which was excellent. Plenty of choice. Being next to Boston's waterfront. we found a nice restaurant for dinner nearby. overlooking the harbour. I wish we could have stayed longer!
Seaport Boston Hotel,Kera,United States of America,1 review,August 15  2017,10,I could have been told that there was a pool so I would have packed a bathing suit,The bed was very comfortable. I also liked the extra fluffy blanket provided.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Patrick,Switzerland,7 Reviews,August 15  2017,8.3,N/A,- ideally located in an area where new restaurants and hotels are popping up- 10 mins walk to Aquarium- extremely friendly staff. surprised our kids with a little present and a treasure hunt- rooms are clean and have all features you would ask for
Seaport Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 15  2017,6.7,We spent extra money for the 'ritzy' hotel. Half the charging ports were broken. pool hours closing was too early (did not get to enjoy). cable channel package was primitive and parking should have been included with the stay.,It was safe. Check in was quick.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Natalie,Ireland,1 review,August 12  2017,7.5,Concierge staff could have been a bit more helpful and friendly.,No tipping policy-made it very straightforward as European visitors. Restaurant staff very good. went out of their way to be helpful.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Gaye,United States of America,1 review,August 11  2017,10,Longer hours at the café would have been nice - couldn't do a mid afternoon Starbucks break without leaving the property.,This is a "service inclusive" hotel meaning that guests do not tip (although there is a service charge). The level of service was above and beyond hotels of a similar class where tipping for everything is expected.
Seaport Boston Hotel,JudyBMaine,United States of America,1 review,August 11  2017,10,I booked the room in my name and used my credit card - but it was in their computer under my husband's name (we have different last names).  Happily I brought the confirmation with number. but if I hadn't. I think they would not have been able to find my prepaid reservation - booked through you folks.  So I don't know how you transmit information. but I think that needs improving.,There seemed to be a real commitment to being a "green" property.  I liked the master switch that let us turn off all the lights when we left the room. and turn them all on when we returned.  Good view with a bit of water visible.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Charlotte,United Kingdom,1 review,August 10  2017,10,The double beds were just slightly too small for two,Clean. comfortable rooms in a great location. Enjoyed the use of the pool and gym.Dinner in the restaurant was delicious and very reasonably priced
Seaport Boston Hotel,Paul,United Arab Emirates,5 Reviews,August 9  2017,9.6,Nothing,Just finished our stay at the Seaport hotel in Boston. Hotel is conviently located to public transport (silver line) but also very walkable to most of the major tourist attractions 15 mins to tea party museum and 30 mins to Boston common. Weather was good so we walked most of the time but the public transport is there as an option. Facilities in the hotel were excellent. smart tv. plenty of usb charging ports also so handy for international travellers without American adapters. room was large and comfortable with a great view over the Seaport. Also spotlessly clean!! They also had a business centre with free printing which was very convenient. Matt in reservations was great. we were honeymooning and had informed hotel so they graciously upgraded our room and we arrived to a bottle of prosecco. Also a message on the phone from Matt personally welcoming us to the hotel and congratulating us which was a very nice touch. Would highly recommend this hotel for anyone planning a trip to Boston.

Seaport Boston Hotel,Ashley,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 31  2017,9.2,The hotel parking is highly priced ($37 a day) and the room was warm. It had a thermostat but it didn't kick on and work as well as I am used to at hotels.,The room was very nice and the staff were all very friendly. At checkin they gave my daughters a goody bag and a stuffed animal (that made a late night much better in their opinion). The beds were very comfortable. having a small refrigerator in the room was helpful. and overall our experience there was a great one. Also. free wifi and being told at moment one of checkin that tipping of staff isn'( needed because those costs have been rolled into their overall pricing was nice.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Susan,United Kingdom,1 review,July 31  2017,10,N/A,Hotel is situated in a great area. Felt very safe walking around the harbour in the evening with my children. Lots of families. couples. groups of friends doing the same thing!
Seaport Boston Hotel,Tracey,Canada,3 Reviews,July 30  2017,9.6,N/A,Staff were excellent and very accommodating . Rooms had all amenities and we had a beautiful view of the harbour. Location is excellent for exploring the harbour area. Lovely patio area to enjoy a cocktail and people watch .
Seaport Boston Hotel,Ken,Australia,1 review,July 30  2017,7.5,Bathroom ventilation marginal. A bit far away from the action. exacerbated by all the construction at the moment.,Good size clean room. Nice wide hallways. Staff were extremely considerate and helpful. Illi in the breakfast room and the doormen/bellboys were particularly good..
Seaport Boston Hotel,KikiJO,United States of America,9 Reviews,July 28  2017,10,The delivery food options (but I am not complaining).,This was my second visit at the Seaport and I was even more impressed with the customer service. overall accomadation and care. My children (6.5 and 2) love this hotel!! We will stay at the Seaport with every Boston visit.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Michael,United States of America,1 review,July 25  2017,9.2,There were fruit flies flying around in the Bar area. we encountered them on 2 different occasions.,Had a quick lunch in the bar. The Hamburger was awesome.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Tracie,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 25  2017,10,The actual entrance to the hotel could have been better marked.  We ended up at a side entrance on the 2nd floor (where the ballroom is) and it looked like the lobby entrance but wasn't.  Sort of confusing after you've taken a red eye flight!,We had a King room and they put a roll away bed in for our son.  Sadly they had us in an accessible room (due to the early hour of our arrival).  Because of this the bathroom was larger but the actual bedroom was smaller making the addition of the roll away bed a terrible bother.The room was nice though and the automated curtains were great.  The restaurant serving breakfast and I guess lunch seemed to be closed whenever we went by.  I think our hours just didn't sync with their operating hours.  We did eat at the other restaurant and it was great!  It's nice that it's a service inclusive hotel.  The Concierge was instrumental in helping us get last minute seats on a whale watching excursion.Location was great.  Walking to most places was easy. bus or trolley stops were close as well.Not a bad thing to say about this hotel.  We'll be back!
Seaport Boston Hotel,Aimee,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 24  2017,8.8,Rates are a little higher than I expected.,We especially enjoyed the great staff at Tamo--especially Gio (?)  My husband and I arrived late from the airport Friday night and he made sure we were able to have something to eat before the kitchen closed.  He could not have been nicer!Also. we were able to check out late. which was a huge help because we were heading out to an event at 12:45 and could stay in the room until then.
Seaport Boston Hotel,Michael,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 24  2017,6.7,My room was looking at buildings not the harbor. While checking out I was told I was all set to go and then the parking attendant told me I had to go back in because my ticket was not working and made me late to pick up my son,N/A
Seaport Boston Hotel,Kelly,United States of America,1 review,July 23  2017,7.9,N/A,This was just a so so place. not great but not bad either. I would stay here again. The one thing that I did like about it is the location was awesome! Close to a bunch of tourist attractions
Seaport Boston Hotel,Virginia,United States of America,1 review,July 22  2017,10,No complaints,Very clean!housekeeping very good!hotel staff very helpful! concierge great!Convenient to waterfront and walking distance from trolley tours and Faneuil market with restaurants and shops! Hotel price well worth it!
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Anonymous,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,October 17  2017,5.4,it was cleanish but not spotless . large chest of drawers took up a lot of room in bedroom but you couldnt open the drawers one bedside light that didnt work between four of us and 2 bedside tables.communal stairs tired and kitchen and bathroom tired . Bed uncomfortable as you rolled into the middle due to uneven floor.Lounge was nice and comfy though and fridge stocked with drinks and snacks and lots of free toiletries fab location,great location
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Mary,United States of America,4 Reviews,September 2  2017,8.8,Beds were lopsided and you would roll towards the middle---also. was with 2 women in their 70s----VERY difficult to get the luggage up 4 flights of stairs with no elevator. it was 60+ stairs to get to our room...which made coming and going quiet a chore. Plus there is NO parking so we ended up just turing our car in 2 days early. Very small sink in bathroom. like VERY SMALL SINK,Location was great and the host was very nice and accommodating :) place was very clean and there were some snacks waiting for us which we really appreciated! Building was beautiful and area was very nice and clean!
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Gill,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,August 10  2017,9.6,It's a cool apartment in an old style building in historic Boston so no lift and fairly basic bathroom and kitchen. Suited us and our teenagers perfectly. There was nothing we didn't like.,Fantastic location right in the heart of Beacon Hill District. Great views across Boston roof tops. Lovely cafes. restaurants. shops close by. Stylish and minimalist inside. Extremely clean and comfortable. Mario extremely helpful and quick to respond to requests. Excellent value for money.
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Scots,United Kingdom,1 review,August 1  2017,7.9,Bathroom is a little small and could do with some attention. Stairs are steep and at an angle as it is an old building so if you struggle with steps or have small children it is not the place for you.,Apartment is spacious with a large sitting room and tv. In excellent location could easily walk to Boston Common and other sites. Has good internet access.
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Nrh,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,July 25  2017,9.2,N/A,The apartment is in a lovely character property close to so many shops and restaurants. Also super close to Boston Common. We really enjoyed our stay. The bed was really comfy and the towels were the softer than any 5star hotel I have ever stayed in.
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Jacqueline,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,July 10  2017,4.2,Where do I start - 4th floor no lift - 58 uneven steps hauling luggage.  Sounds crazy but apartment floors off level falling to the middle of the apartment.  We were a family of four much too small for four people. Even sitting on the loo you were lob sided. Bathroom tiny no fan. Kitchen tiny no space to cook. mat dirt rooms didn't look so small in photos. Sofa in living area not too clean.  Booking.com should remove this from the website.,This property was extremely poor.  We booked three properties through booking.com for our recent visit to USA and this was the only one that was disappointing definitely would not stay here again.  Cannot think of anything I liked except it was relatively cheap but would of preferred to have paid more for a better standard waste of money.
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Irene,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,June 10  2017,9.2,Earlier information I had emailed a week before but got no reply then had internet problems which meant I couldn't access into apartment took a couple of hrs and a fair few phone calls but eventually got in however apartment is up four levels with a very steep staircase with luggage so not for the faint hearted,Great location not far from main area of Boston which felt safe apartment was clean and had what you needed for a short stay
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,James,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,May 28  2017,8.8,When booking we did not realise the flat was on the 4th floor without an elevator so carrying luggage was difficult,The location and a large amount of space. The host was really responsive to any needs and Boston is a great city.
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Beth,Canada,2 Reviews,April 5  2017,9.6,Nothing could have been better but the bathroom sink is very tiny ; however. one doesn't spend much time there (unlike the living room which was lovely). Also. no elevator and one must navigate four flight so stairs. For someone with mobility issues or lots of heavy luggage. it could prove to be challenging. It was not a deterrent to us and we preferred being on the top floor with no sounds above us. Also. although the building was quite. it is a city so bring your own white noise and sleep soundly.,Beds and bedding were very comfortable. Towels were unworn and very absorbent. Coffee was supplied via Keurig including Starbucks. Lots of light.  Bedrooms were well separated from each other so not impacted by sounds from the other family members.
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,G,Spain,2 Reviews,March 13  2017,10,N/A,Super clean. fresh. comfy. quiet. We changed after to two other hotels. and the comfort was not comparable. I would especially note the comfort of the bed and fresh bed sheets that seemed to be quite new! All in all. full recommendation. The bathroom is small but gives all you need. and the rest of the flat it just great.
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Karen,United Kingdom,13 Reviews,January 22  2017,9.2,The kitchen had the basic number of plates . dishes and glasses (between 2 and 4) but if there had been a party of 4 staying it would have been a bit difficult.. It would have been helpful to have known in advance that it was up 4 flights of narrow stairs.,Location.  It was comfortable. clean and warm.  Thoughtful provision of snacks so there was something to eat when you arrived.
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Cassandre,United States of America,1 review,January 16  2017,9.6,The only thing I would specify is that they do require you to pay previous to arriving. I did email the owner to let him know booking.com said the opposite and he said he would get it resolved. :) also. just a heads up. the apartment is on top of a massive hill and on the top floor. no elevators. ğŸ˜‚ it's definitely a workout so be sure to bring your A game!,The owner left us snacks and plenty of toiletries. Any time we had a question. we emailed him and he responded within minutes with an answer. Best trip ever!
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Ann,Canada,4 Reviews,December 5  2016,9.0,There are a lot of steep stairs going up to the 4th floor and there was no hairdryer provided as was mentioned in the ad.,The location was excellent. Close to attractions could walk to great shopping and restaurants. Beds were very comfortable. Living area was spacious. There was lots of hot water for showers. Kitchen facilities came in handy for making breakfast and morning coffee.
112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Lisa,United Kingdom,1 review,September 15  2017,6.3,No lift and difficult climbing 4 flights of stairs with heavy suitcases. Also property was in need of updating,Location

112 Myrtle St #9 by Lyon Apartments,Peter,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,June 11  2017,4.2,Dated. cramp. loads of stairs to the top. No lift so don't take loads of cases/luggage,Location in Beacon Hill

Patrick's Place,Susan,United States of America,1 review,October 31  2017,10,N/A,Very comfortable and stylish. Patrick was incredibly accommodating. even waking up very early to give us a ride to the airport. I was only there one night. but was wishing I could stay longer.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Lynne,Canada,3 Reviews,October 31  2017,7.1,Attention to detail for cleaning staff. Clock. smell.  How can you not report these issues.,No free internet. smell of overwhelming body odor in room. turbo flush on toilet: you can hear every flush around you. clock didn't work.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Anonymous,New Zealand,1 review,October 31  2017,6.7,The member of staff who checked me out was fairly rude/unhelpful when I asked for a final bill. He said booking.com would provide it. but they sent me a zero dollar owing account statement. without any indication of the actual total paid (the original booking.com notice explained that the quoted price was excluding taxes. so I wanted to know the tax inclusive price).,The man who checked me in was friendly. welcoming and professional.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Happy,United States of America,1 review,October 30  2017,7.9,The only negative was the parking rate. We found a garage(Back Bay Garage) a few blocks away that was less than half the price.There isn't a real coffee bar. They offered coffee ( for a fee) on a side table in the lobby. Most hotels offer this sort of coffee for free. Walk across the street to Flour for great coffee.,Perfect location if you want to walk around Newbury and Boyleston. Lobby was upbeat with nice decor. We were able to check in early which was fantastic. Flour Bakery is right across the street which is not to be missed. You are attached to the Prudential Center Mall which is a huge plus when the weather is less than ideal. Overall. a wonderful experience.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Anonymous,France,1 review,October 29  2017,7.1,Wifi not included for Booking.com customers. Did not fulfil my floor request. Generally you can tell that everything is extra for booking.com customers. too bad!,Comfortable and clean room. nice location and amenities.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Anonymous,France,5 Reviews,October 28  2017,6.7,Noisy room ( from the corridor).

Sheraton Boston Hotel,Nicolaas,Netherlands,13 Reviews,October 27  2017,6.3,Small crampy room. outdated and needs upgrade.Expensive breakfast. no value for money (only regular high carb. fatty. food).,Very friendly staff.Great location.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Roman,United States of America,11 Reviews,October 23  2017,7.5,Old school traditional interior design.A little far from the downtown. And price was ridiculously high.,The best thing was a large indoor swimming pool (it was a little cold there).It actually has a glass roof that is opening on summer.We stayed in October. so they closed the roof.Area around the hotel is also good - close to Boylston St - great for night life.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,braines2007,United States of America,4 Reviews,October 21  2017,2.9,Hotel &amp; Rooms need updating and especially the tiny Bathroom.  Also. the restaurant is not a pleasant environment in that it is in an enclosed area that looks like a Meeting Room.  The Bathroom....I stepped our of the shower as my wife opened the bathroom door and I was nearly knocked over.  The Bathroom is the smallest I've ever seen in any hotel including in Paris and Rome.  There was no mini-bar.  Cheap...Two plastic cups and two glasses (glass) in the room.  All I can say is that the bed was okay.  Oh. and the price of more than $750 for one night in this room was way overboard by any stretch....,Not much of anything!
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Gabo,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 19  2017,9.6,Parking! It was not a cheap place to stay and they even have parking in site. They should offer at least a special rate for hotel guests! They do not and thatâ€™s not right,It was a pretty nice stay at the hotel. No major complaints
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 18  2017,8.8,there was some street clousure when we arrived blocking the entrance to the hotel.,check in and out was easy and the baggage hold was easy to use.. What more do I need.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Anonymous,Canada,6 Reviews,October 17  2017,10,N/A,The Sheraton is the perfect hotel for the business traveler. The room is spacious. has a comfortable bed. and all is very clean. The staff is also professional and trained to be expedient when checking travelers in.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 16  2017,3.3,Upon arrival I was told at the check-in that the hotel was fully booked. They rushed to find me a room. The suite that they put me in was way below average. Room hadn't been clean. there were toe nail clippings in the bedroom. bathroom had a broken faucet and no toilet paper. lacked basic amenities (no minibar. or toiletries). For the amount of money I paid. the Sheraton was SO not worth it. I might as well have stayed at a Motel 8 for the type of service I received.,The hotel was centrally located.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Adrian,United Kingdom,28 Reviews,October 16  2017,10,If the hotel know that there is a lot of demand for club rooms at weekends. (which surely they must). the facilities for high demand should exist at breakfast service. A larger toaster. rather than the 4 slice appliance used for example. would be more appropriate at busy times. Coffee sadly was not memorable either. We had hoped for a relaxed breakfast for our last morning in Boston but it wasn't to be.,Central full service hotel with all the facilities you would expect and more! I chose a Club room with access to the Club lounge. It was a very busy breakfast service which I had not expected. and as so. the lounge was crowded and people had to wait for tables. It was also extremely busy around the buffet service areas. so much so. that the staff found it tricky to keep up with demand. This made the "exclusivity" of the Club lounge difficult as it was probably more crowded than the lobby restaurant. but it was a Saturday. Having said that. I felt the lounge room was too small for the amount of people who needed to be served at that time and it certainly wasn't relaxed. I wish we had opted to start breakfast earlier. but as the breakfast service continued up to 11.00. our chosen time of around 8.00 seemed reasonable. The breakfast offered was tasty and with a wide selection of options. of which scrambled egg was the only hot dish. Staff were all attentive. knowledgeable and friendly. Overall a good experience. but I was surprised by the obvious popularity of the Club rooms.

Sheraton Boston Hotel,Gina,United States of America,1 review,October 15  2017,9.2,Old fashioned alarm clock preset by previous guest woke me up. Low water pressure in shower. Light blocking drapes. would like option to let light in but maintain privacy. Still a bit expensive despite the "deal".,Large comfortable room. comfortable bed. fresh bed linens. large TV. streaming Netflix.  Complimentary bottled water available to drink in room
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Neesha,United States of America,7 Reviews,October 12  2017,10,Nothing! Everything was perfect!,This hotel is absolutely amazing! You never have to even go outside if you choose not too! They have everything you need and itâ€™s a bonus that so many shops and restaurants are connected to the hotel. We had a city view on the top floor it was amazing
Sheraton Boston Hotel,David,United Kingdom,1 review,October 5  2017,7.5,Very pricey restaurant and bar. $25 for a small wine and a small beer. Use the Cheesecake Factory in the Prudential Centre.,Large comfy bed. view across the Charles River. proxcimity to the T and Downtown Boston.

Sheraton Boston Hotel,Kendall,United States of America,1 review,September 30  2017,8.8,N/A,The pool was amazing.  We got to take advantage of one of the last hot days in September. We were in town for a Red Sox game the ease of being able to walk was well worth it.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Carlos,United States of America,12 Reviews,September 29  2017,8.3,N/A,Nice hotel. A bit pricey. especially when they charge $10 a day for wifi in the room. Had a nice view of the river and Cambridge. Underground parking was also expensive. Try the lot across the street.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Colleen,United States of America,5 Reviews,September 28  2017,8.8,The breakfast was horrible and the staff so unfriendly. There are far better places to eat within walking distance.,It was so close to everything. We walked every where. We walked to the Fenway and MFA. Back Bay is the BEST location!
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Becca,United Kingdom,1 review,September 25  2017,8.3,The rooms are a *little* dated and I think it's stingy to charge for wifi in the rooms.,Great location and easy to access with the airport shuttle. Staff were friendly and helpful and it was great to be able to store our luggage after checkout.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Carrie,Canada,1 review,September 25  2017,9.6,For the price of the room I feel that wifi should have been included.

Sheraton Boston Hotel,Rolf &amp; Grace,United States of America,66 Reviews,September 24  2017,7.5,Nothing really. it offers everything you expect from a Sheraton.,Located near Copley Square and Prudential Tower. but a good half hour walk from Boston Common.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 22  2017,10,A hotel shuttle is truly paramount.   It's a service with long term benefits for both guests and your hotel.,The customer service and location.  Magnificent.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,William,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,September 16  2017,7.5,The decor in the rooms could do with updating and we found a half smoked cigerette at the side of the sofa!,The room was spacious. which was ideal as we were travelling with a baby. The hotel is connected to the Prudential Centre which made popping out for something to eat in the evening very easy.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Alyssia,United States of America,1 review,September 15  2017,10,N/A,The hotel is really close to the train system and a short walk from Fenway which was great after long days of sight seeing and watching the game at Fenway.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Susan,United Kingdom,20 Reviews,September 13  2017,5.4,Booked this hotel myself and my friend because of the swimming pool for our 60th birthday celebrations. Only used pool once as closed for majority of our stay to refurb. Staff unhelpful. offered use of pool at Marriott through the shopping mall. would have booked at Marriott had we known re pool at Sheraton.,Comfy bed. decent size room and good bathroom
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Mary,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,September 12  2017,6.3,For a Sheraton I expected complimentary Wifi. good quality sheets. to not hear toilets flushing in other rooms. and double glazed windows so I didn't hear the construction (jackhammer) outside my window.,I liked the large lobby and bar/restaurant. All very convenient. There were also lots of local restaurants and shopping. so in that respect it was very good. Also a spa and salon. which is operated separately.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Barbara,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,September 12  2017,10,Booked on the understanding that there was a pool at the hotel.  Unfortunately it was being refitted but the staff offered the pool at the Marriot which was excellent.,Stayed in Club area so the views were wonderful and gave a good impression of Boston.  The Club Lounge for Breakfast was excellent with very helpful and friendly staff.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Cahli,Australia,13 Reviews,September 12  2017,6.7,Really poor water pressure. Without sounding petty I felt for the cost of the room per night that better quality toilet paper could be used. Although check-in staff were really friendly at check-in. Subsequent visits to front desk to ask simple questions  felt like we were putting them out. Very poor baggage collection on checkout.,Location fine. Original check-in easy with a friendly staff member.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Serenity32,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,September 12  2017,8.3,Went to use the pool but it was being emptied and refilled. No notice was shown to let guests know in advance.,Mattress was so comfy and pillows gave an excellent night sleep. Our room on 17th floor gave a fantastic river view.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Paula,United States of America,1 review,September 11  2017,7.0,my mattress was very worn and uncomfortable. water pressure lacked a bit.,The location to Back Bay scene was fantastic.  The hotel lobby was generously sized to accommodate a large or smaller group of travellers. very inviting.  The hotel lobby bar was great - good food and reasonably priced cocktails and the staff behind the bar was excellent.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Julie,United Kingdom,1 review,September 11  2017,7.5,No free wifi in the room is basically it. No tea making until requested but was provided promptly,To charge guests for wifi access in your room is pretty poor in this day and age. Though not a massive inconvenience it is frustrating for international guests reliant on wifi and for that reason alone I would avoid
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Gordon,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,September 10  2017,4.6,When we booked into the Sheraton we were really excited about our 5 nights in this 5-star hotel as it's really not often we'd do that. But as it was a special occasion boked with family we decided to pay the premium. And what swung the decision to go there was the amazing looking open air pool with retractable roof.However. our excitement did not last long and neither did our stay.Check in was fine but when we got to our room it was tiny. A queen bed shoved right up against a wall right next to the elevators. which were really noisy. On inquiring about a change we were told it would be an additional $30 per night. which seemed exceptional given the price already paid. What added insult to injury was that one of our other party of 4 rooms who all booked at the same time were offered a $20 upgrade and my brother got one for free! Terrible and frustrating inconsistency all delivered with very poor front desk attitude.However. the worst was to come when after a huge morning's exploring round Boston in 30 degree heat. the 8 of us made our way back to the hotel looking forward to jumping in and lazing by the amazing pool. But when we got there there was no water in the pool and all the drains and surrounds were dug up for what we found out was planned maintenance.At no point were there any guest notices in the lobby. rooms or elevators. When asked why we weren't emailed the excuse offered was the emails addresses from Booking.com did not come through. Possibly one of the lamest excuses I have ever heard.So. there we were....3 days left in a hotel booked specifically so we could spend time relaxing by a pool which was now a construction site.As you can imagine we were livid and went straight to complain. The way this was then handled by the Guest Relations Manger (Rita) was absolutely disgraceful.,Nothing - it was awful on all counts
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Robert,Canada,7 Reviews,September 10  2017,9.2,Went to go swimming and pool was closed-very disappointed  Could use a magnifying mirror in bathroom,Great view-bright room-bathroom-good counter space-well lit-fridge-nice sitting area-location excellent-near shopping.restaurants.Fenway park and transportationCleaning staff friendly and helpful
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Fayza,Bahrain,9 Reviews,September 9  2017,9.2,N/A,upon check in. the front desk lady suggested that i upgrade our room to a suite for an extra amount of US$20 per night. which was the same amount i was going to pay for an extra bed in the normal room.  But of course the suite was more spacious and had a sofa that turned into a bed which was excellent.  if she hadn't suggested the suite . i would have paid the US$20 for extra bed and we would have been stuck in the normal room with no space.  i appreciated her advice.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Marie,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 8  2017,5.0,The whole room smelled like a very odiferous man's armpit.  I thought the smell would dissipate over our stay but it did not.  It was really hard to relax and enjoy the room with the most pervasive odor of someone else in the room.  I don't think that could have been a problem common to every room however. and so besides that the place was fine.,The room was generous sized
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Gregory,United States of America,1 review,September 7  2017,9.2,The desk sent me a welcome text at 8:30 AM about 1 hour before I was planning to leave welcoming me asking if there was anything I needed. The pool was closed for repairs. Yes,It worked well for me great location. Very nice the Valet had me self park to save money.

Sheraton Boston Hotel,Anonymous,Australia,6 Reviews,September 4  2017,5.8,Lifts took forever. our bath plug didn't work so I couldn't have a bath and the bath/shower was dirty. We were also in handicapped room but the toilet seat was broken and I feel that is a big safety issue for someone who may be in a wheelchair if they slipped off that!,Bed was very comfy and loved that there was a Starbucks in the lobby!
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 4  2017,7.1,At check in she tried to switch us to a queen room not king.  When I corrected her she made us show our confirmation emails and then wait saying the king room was not ready... 45 minutes later I got the concierge to help me.  He quickly gave us a king room.  I felt like she was just making us wait because we wouldn't take the queen room.,N/A
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Lisa,Canada,1 review,September 4  2017,4.6,Parking overnight was extremely expensive at the hotel we were unaware of that also the room was very tiny and the bathroom was extremely tiny and uncomfortable. You could not control the temperature in the room also we did call maintenance and the problem was not solved. Also you had to pay for wifi per day which I thought was parable. I would not suggest coming to this hotel.,Centrally located
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Jean-luc,France,1 review,September 3  2017,8.3,Booking.com service has been a nightmare. Please see contradictory emails you sent me : reservation confirmed. then not confirmed and finally confirmed again when I was in the room already. I need a serious explanation before using Booking.com again !,N/A
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Michael,Canada,2 Reviews,September 2  2017,7.5,Parking was very expensive ($58 per day).  Also had to pay $10 per day for wifi.

Very clean. easy check in. and good location.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Robert,United States of America,1 review,September 1  2017,8.8,Wasn't able to sleep at all due to the noise level doming from the elevator shafts located to the other side of my room.  It sounded as if I spent the night in a subway station tunnel with the constant whirring of the trains approaching and going past. If I ever stay there again I would insist that my room is as far away from the elevators as possible.,Great location. 10 minute walk to Fenway Park. Plenty of shopping and restaurant options in the area.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Zeynep,Turkey,1 review,August 31  2017,8.3,Breakfast wasn't included to the cost and it was pricy.

There are free desktops to use and a Starbucks in the lobby. Free wifi is available.

Sheraton Boston Hotel,Tanya,United States of America,1 review,August 29  2017,8.8,The toilet would not properly flush.  You had to flush over and over and over just to get the toilet paper to go down.,We requested a water view and it was amazing. We were on the top floor on one side of the building with the sun rising on the east. so our location within was perfect!!!! Our entire wall on one side was all window. Again great bc we could see Fenway &amp; the Charles river.
Sheraton Boston Hotel,Michael,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,August 29  2017,5.0,Unfortunately the first room we went into had a very bad sewage smell and we had to ask to be moved.

Sheraton Boston Hotel,Paul,United States of America,1 review,August 29  2017,9.6,You're in the city so everything's pricey.,The hotel is centrally located in the back bay of Boston.

Sheraton Boston Hotel,Natalie,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 23  2017,10,Wish I had a better view it wasn't horrible I could see the city and a little bit of Fenway but seeing a rooftop of a parking garage isn't that fun.,They placed us in a handicap room which we were unaware of.

Sheraton Boston Hotel,Sylvie,Canada,1 review,August 10  2017,4.2,the room was dirty meaning there was dust everywhere. you could tell that they really don't clean the surfaces as there was dust everywhere. even the plugs it was so thick.

Sheraton Boston Hotel,Nicholas,China,1 review,August 3  2017,6.3,TV in one neighboring room was too loud and advertisement of Sheraton (man jumping in the pool to take a toy) were repeated day and night.Hotels are too expensive in Boston. During one week I stayed for booking discount 250 USD. But I had to move out last night. because I did not want to pay 500 dollars for 1 night. Is there a carpet made of gold in the lobby or gold toilets? No. lobby is too old.Even in Shanghai (China) you can find now better and higher stars hotels for lower price.,At least hotel had roof swimming pool

Sheraton Boston Hotel,Abdullah,Saudi Arabia,11 Reviews,July 31  2017,8.3,Zero flexibility with checkout time. I asked for 30 minutes extra and couldn't get the front desk to cooperate.

Newbury Guest House,Anonymous,United States of America,8 Reviews,October 27  2017,6.7,The bathroom was a different matter - shower curtain fell out of wall if touched. shower fittings were very poor quality and rusted. tiles were damaged and badly re-grouted; to left of sink a soap dispenser (?) had been removed. and nobody bothered to sand and path the resulting mess. No bottle opener in room. despite ice bucket and glasses - had to request at reception. where there was only one. so could not take to room!  No toast at breakfast unless specially requested - odd.  For a "boutique" hotel. poor.,The staff were very nice and helpful.  The main room was fine. apart from a light that hung too low so that I continually banged my head on it.
Newbury Guest House,William,United States of America,1 review,October 26  2017,8.8,Didn't notice until I got home. but was charged $798.86 instead of quoted booking.com quote of $753.08.

Newbury Guest House,Keith,United States of America,1 review,October 23  2017,6.3,Staff was not very helpful.  Nobody greets you when you arrive.  Hopefully you are capable of handling your own luggage because they will not help.  We had a problem with the in room safe and had to ask 4 times before someone came to help.,Bed was comfortable.  Location of hotel is very good.
Newbury Guest House,Gill,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,October 23  2017,9.6,There were a couple of things going on in Boston while we were there. it would of been nice to have been advised by reception as we would have liked to attend.,Room very comfortable. very clean.

Newbury Guest House,Vicki,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 21  2017,9.2,N/A,Lovely friendly small hotel in a good location . We found the evening a little quiet in the area  as mainly surrounded by shops. a few bars a block away so easy to reach . Hotel bar stayed open til 9 and had great staff - you have to visit if only to meet Brian - what a character ! Hotel room was comfortable and coffee was available in lobby . Breakfast was fairly standard.
Newbury Guest House,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,October 17  2017,7.5,Clarity of when the bill would be submitted on our card could have been more transparent.

Newbury Guest House,Michele,United States of America,9 Reviews,October 9  2017,8.3,Bathroom is small. but is to be expected in this type of architecture.  A better setup outside the bathroom with a mirror. outlet and small table or shelf would be quite helpful.  Curious crown moulding repairs should be redone.  Outlets struggled to hold a plug in.,Staff was terrific - friendly. efficient. helpful.  Beds were comfortable.  Understated style was lovely and comfortable.  The location can't be beat.  The Patisserie downstairs made fantastic Kouign Amann!
Newbury Guest House,Mary,United States of America,1 review,October 9  2017,10,Our room smelled like someone had been smoking in it - but once I advised the front desk - they were very accommodating.,The people who run the hotel are very very nice and the location is perfect - right in the middle of Newbury Street.

Newbury Guest House,Jade,Netherlands,18 Reviews,September 13  2017,7.5,N/A,Location is perfect. On Newbury St. just steps away from tons of great restaurants. shops. bars and more. Also just a stones throw away from the Commons and Commonwealth Ave.

Newbury Guest House,Natalya,United States of America,1 review,September 8  2017,10,Breakfast was disappointing overall.  While the fresh fruit was good and they had cereal available even before the official breakfast time of 7:30 - 9. the scrambled eggs had pockets of very salty areas. while other sections of the eggs were perfectly seasoned.  The bacon was very undercooked.  As a business traveler. I was also surprised to see that the full breakfast wasn't available until 7:30.  Other hotels catering to business travelers start their breakfast hours at 6.  But maybe this hotel is designed more for tourists.,Great location right in the heard of Back Bay.  The staff was extremely courteous and the room was nicely furnished.  I loved having a robe available for my use.   Having breakfast included was a nice feature.
Newbury Guest House,William,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,September 7  2017,9.2,Although the breakfast was very good perhaps a little variation in the menu and more choice. But hard to be critical as the quality of the breakfast was so good.,The location was excellent. Newbury Street is a very nice neighbourhood with lots of good quality restaurants. There is a subway station nearby and if interested in baseball the ground is nearby
Newbury Guest House,Robin,United States of America,1 review,September 6  2017,9.6,The parking was ok. and we were glad to get off-street for $20. While we were parked there. however. another vehicle scraped the right rear fender of our car down to the metal. These things happen in the city. but we were dismayed to face repairs. Newbury House might want to look into whether it's realistic to park as many cars in the alley as they do.,The location of Newbury House makes walking to much of historic Boston (the Common. the Public Garden) and Fenway Park. various art museums and boutiques very easy and pleasant. There are dozens of cafes and bistros on Newbury Street. lots of night life if you're interested. It's a beautiful city spot. and a terrific choice if you're doing downtown.
Newbury Guest House,Lauren,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 1  2017,9.6,Our room was on the second floor and faced Newbury Street. so we could hear people at the restaurants below and on the sidewalk in front of the hotel. Other than that it was great!,Very comfortable bed and room. Especially loved the robes. The breakfast was fantastic! Very generous for a 'continental' breakfast. Sausage. eggs. cereal. fruit. etc...
Newbury Guest House,Anonymous,Japan,1 review,August 24  2017,9.6,It is an older building that needs some TLC to bring it into the current time period (minor structural and plumbing).,Staff was excellent. Very informative and helpful.

Newbury Guest House,Chris,United States of America,8 Reviews,July 26  2017,7.0,Disappointed in the staff. Expectations were high being that it is a boutique hotel. Had to force attention from front desk. It seemed like we had to initiate all conversatiosns. A simple eyes-up from the computer and a "How was your day?". would have been fine. No interaction. At one point there was an argument. among the staff. in front of us as to why there was luggage in the back room.,Location was awesome! In the heart of everything. Breakfast included. Great place to stay to start the vacation.
Newbury Guest House,Kathy,United States of America,1 review,July 22  2017,6.7,The only thing I didn't like was the size of the room.,The only problem I had was that the room was a little small for 4 people.  I should have checked the square footage.
Newbury Guest House,Joyce,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 16  2017,5.4,No elevator. We were ushered up 4 flights of stairs the last flight being spiral to get to a small room with a tiny bath looking over the street. We are over 65 so found this quite arduous and very expensive for the quality if the room. We were awakened the next morning quite early to the sounds of an extremely loud wood chipper.,The pastries and coffee at the front desk. consumed outside in a rocker overlooking the sea.
Newbury Guest House,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 15  2017,6.7,We were a unique situation - I appreciate the help we were given - but could sense the irritation with the staff.,Breakfast was great and location could not be beat!!  so close to so many things!!
Newbury Guest House,Katherine,Bermuda,5 Reviews,July 8  2017,10,Front door was a little difficult with luggage.,The room was very comfortable and adequate - bed was great.Proximity to all the good spots on Newbury Street was excellent.Bistro restaurant was very good and we would definitely eat there again.
Newbury Guest House,Marcelo,United States of America,6 Reviews,July 3  2017,9.6,Bathroom could use a slight upgrade. but not terrible.,Great that there is parking.  The location right in the middle of Newbury street is exceptional.  Walk right down the steps and you are in the middle of one of the nicest neighborhoods in Boston.  A couple of blocks away is the beautiful Esplanade along the edge of the Charles river.
Newbury Guest House,Brigitte,Australia,6 Reviews,June 27  2017,7.5,Waking up at 6 because of jet lag. it would have been nice to have tea making facility in the room. like at all hotels I've stayed in the last few years,Room 412 was stark and no frills. but clean and bed comfortable. Fine breakfast
Newbury Guest House,Rebecca,United States of America,7 Reviews,June 27  2017,10,I really have few complaints.  I think the only thing I can say is that the pillows were not very fluffy.,The location of this hotel is wonderful.  You are in the middle of so many restaurant and shopping opportunities. as well as being an easy walk to Fenway Park.  We enjoyed being able to go to a local bar after the ball game and only have a short walk back to the Inn.  The bed was very comfortable and the room was spotless.  Even though our room was right next to the elevator. it was not noisy during the night.  Breakfast was great and the staff was very friendly.
Newbury Guest House,Naus,Australia,17 Reviews,June 23  2017,8.8,The room was good. but it did not have tea/coffee making facilities.  There were urns downstairs on the ground floor with tea/coffee biscuits but we found it inconvenient to go down.  We often feel like a cup of tea later at night and would have preferred to make it in our room.  It wouldn't cost much to supply a kettle and tea/coffee in each room.  We are sure that future guests would appreciate it.  Breakfasts were quite basic.  We tried to get 'normal' toast and found it difficult as the only toast was French toast which was 'sloppy'.  The waitress told us that the toaster was broken.  Again. how much would it cost to buy a toaster for guests. so that they could cook their own toast at breakfast.  Also. there wasn't much variety of food at breakfast.,The location was excellent.  However our room was on the third floor and when we arrived. the lift was broken so we had to climb up and down three flights of stairs for a few days.  This was very difficult.Apart from that. the location was great. close to everything.  Short walk to the pick up point for the hop on hop off trolley.  Walking distance to the Common and Public Park.  Lovely walk along Newbury Street with lots of restaurants in Newbury Street and other close by streets.
Newbury Guest House,Mindy,United States of America,1 review,June 19  2017,9.2,Elevator was out the first couple of days we were there. Staff was accommodating. but we were on the 4th floor with a lot of luggage.The shower is very small in the standard room.,The staff was wonderful; the location was perfect for site seeing &amp; shopping. Very walkable area and easy access to mass transportation. Historicall area - Beautiful architecture. Nice restaurant in building.
Newbury Guest House,Katherine,United States of America,1 review,June 18  2017,9.2,The elevator was down so we had to go up and down 3 flights of stairs...probably not the norm...but the stairs are so old they slope...was amusing but glad they fixed it before we had to take our bags down.  They did apologize.  Rooms and bathroom a bit small but everything else was excellent.,Loved the quaint location. the free EARLY continental breakfast from the restaurant next door. the service from the staff friendly and helpful and efficient. the sound proof rooms that you would not expect from an older hotel
Newbury Guest House,Jurijs,Latvia,16 Reviews,June 18  2017,8.3,Seems like overpriced but for Boston level - ok,Room and young boy working at front desk-humor sense &amp; full answers on all our questions from tax till route.

Newbury Guest House,Donald,United States of America,1 review,June 15  2017,7.5,Elevator broke on last day. Room faced the street. lots of noise on the weekend. It was a nice room. but I think it cost too much - probably because it was Boston.,Good (free) breakfast. Clean. Good location. Staff friendly.
Newbury Guest House,Gillian,United States of America,1 review,May 28  2017,8.8,The breakfast staff could have been a little more helpful - I had never stayed with you before and wasn't sure if I should seat myself and wait to be served or help myself.  The food  was just OK.,The bed was comfortable and the pillows were soft. The room was cosy and the shower was hot.The young man at the desk on Friday morning let me use some heavy duty tape for me luggage label .
Newbury Guest House,Mary,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 9  2017,9.6,N/A,All The staff were great at front desk. including owner. Friendly &amp; helpful. even in the wee hours.

Newbury Guest House,Richard,United States of America,1 review,May 6  2017,6.3,Room location was horrible. even though I asked numerous times before our arrival. for something better.,Location is perfect. Breakfast is fair. but repetitive.
Newbury Guest House,Lesley,United Kingdom,16 Reviews,May 5  2017,7.1,Bathroom was tiny and shower had a shower curtain! Breakfast choices were limited. having said that what I ate was perfectly adequate.,Location was perfect. loved walking up and down Newbury street which has lots of interesting shops and nice restaurants. Hotel is only 5 minutes walk to the Prudential centre and 15 mins from Boston Common. Bed was comfortable and room spotlessly clean.
Newbury Guest House,Sharon,United States of America,8 Reviews,April 24  2017,8.8,N/A,We visited Boston for the Marathon - an amazing experience!  Newbury Guest House is a great small hotel in a brownstone. remodeled in the last few years.  The room was very comfortable.  There is an elevator which is good as the stairs are historic and therefore a little uneven and steep.  Nice to have a small frig and a safe in our room.  View out the bay windows very enjoyable.  Safe area for walking and many restaurants very close.  Great staff.  friendly and very willing to help with anything. We really enjoyed the included breakfast each day as not only did they have the usual goodies of eggs. potatoes. meats and fruit but also had just made croissants from their own bakery located in a shop downstairs.
Newbury Guest House,Eknalprev,Netherlands,13 Reviews,April 13  2017,7.9,The hotel is a Victorian house which generally means it's creaky and noisy. My room was next to the elevator and that was quite noisy. Didn't loose any sleep over it though. Breakfast wasn't astonishing in terms of variety. but it was good and fresh.,Nice location. Newbury street is one of the upmarket shopping streets with lots of interesting boutiques and restaurants. Located very close to the Hynes Convention Center it's also a convenient place for business travellers who dislike the large conference hotel chains. Comfortable room with a good bed.
Newbury Guest House,Andrew,Finland,18 Reviews,March 27  2017,5.8,Staff not particularly friendly or helpfulRoom service occurred whilst my girlfriend was in the shower and didn't hear them enter.Old-fashioned difficult to use showerBreakfast very average,great location for Hynes Conference Center
Newbury Guest House,Cristina,United States of America,1 review,March 16  2017,10,N/A,I have stayed at the Newbury Guesthouse many times and this was by far my best visit because of Eddie at the front desk. Leah. Raymond and housekeeping staff are also kind and welcoming.
Newbury Guest House,Tanya,United States of America,1 review,March 6  2017,9.6,The coffee was warm to cold.,Every thing was just right except. the room was wonderful and the staff were super. I wish that I had all their names to say a special thank you to them as they were all helpful. accommodating and friendly. Eddie thanks!Breakfast was filling.
Newbury Guest House,New,United States of America,1 review,February 20  2017,5.4,While the room was adequate. the bathroom needed attention: there was black mold on the ceiling; the extraction fan was very noisy yet inefficient; the tiny bathtub with dirty-looking caulking was unappealing (had I known. I would have saved a few bucks and booked the shower-only room); and there was no shower gel. toothpaste. slippers. or bathrobe. also no bottled water. tea or coffee in the room.  The walls are so thin that the adjoining room's occupant complained about hearing my TV.  The uninspiring breakfast buffet was the exact same boring thing every day (no variety) and the floors in the "bistro" were inexplicably sticky.,Location is very good for walking to shops and restaurants. not too far to walk to Boston Common. the T is just a couple of blocks away.  Off-street parking at $20 a day is reasonable for Boston.  Bed comfortable.  Towels fluffy (although smelled of bleach).  Reasonably quiet despite urban setting.
Newbury Guest House,Pratiksha,India,1 review,February 15  2017,8.8,N/A,Excellent location. All the staff was very nice and helpful. especially Eddie and Leah. very good people. thanks for all your help and guidance as it was our first visit to Boston. Clean rooms and good breakfast. Had a nice stay.
Newbury Guest House,Izi,United States of America,2 Reviews,January 30  2017,7.5,terrible breakfast. I can get a better breakfast at a cheap motel. First of all breakfast ends at 9:30 AM in the morning on a Sunday.. too early -  but most disappointing was the content of the breakfast and how it was served. one of the joys of going to a bed-and breakfast is the customized breakfast with fresh eggs/omellete. pancakes etc.. made to order.. here we had some soggy eggs and sausage in a minimalist breakfast setting with stale croissant's..,location/parking/staff/cleanliness
Newbury Guest House,Anne,United States of America,23 Reviews,January 23  2017,9.2,The room smelled like bleach. Fortunately it was a mild day so we could open the windows to air out of the room. That did help. but the smell of bleach lingered. Otherwise it would have been completely excellent.,Great location. Excellent staff.

Newbury Guest House,Sonia,United States of America,1 review,January 5  2017,10,Need ro know parking ihas to be requested and reserved in advance. -not free . but well worth getting since paeking is pricier in area.,Beautiful  architecture. 2 blocks from prudential center and  haynes convention center. Beautiful nlock -lots of places to eat and shop nearby. Loved the very helpful and welcoming front desk staff!
Newbury Guest House,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,December 29  2016,10,The front desk clerk did not confirm if I had a bathtub or not. which I was desperately looking forward to after missing my connecting flight home from Europe. It's an old building. so it's not reasonable to expect bathtubs in every room. but I would've appreciated one that had one if it was available.,I checked in late and all accommodations were ready and waiting for me. I had an unexpected layover in Boston and had a fantastic time.
Newbury Guest House,Debra,United States of America,1 review,December 22  2016,10,Only thing I didn't like about room 211 was the bolt didn't work from the inside.  Single woman traveling I like to bolt my room from the inside.,Love the location and the rooms were safe. clean and comfortable.  The eggs were fluffy and the french toast was the best I've ever eaten.  The staff was friendly. informative and helpful.
Newbury Guest House,Justine,South Africa,1 review,December 19  2016,9.2,The breakfast is the same everyday so some variation would be good.  However the standard selection is tasty!,The location is great and on one of the nicest streets in Boston. It's close to the T but Boston is very walkable from this location.  Great restaurants. bars and shops right outside the BnB.  We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back!
Newbury Guest House,Watanabe,Japan,2 Reviews,December 18  2016,8.3,N/A,Great Location. it was convenient for shopping and airport access:) lovely place to enjoy style of Boston. Staff was friendly and Breakfast was also good!
Newbury Guest House,tastetheworld,United States of America,8 Reviews,December 17  2016,8.3,Only one outlet easily available and I had to unplug the lamp to access it. No tub. but a clean shower nook.,Excellent location. minutes from the Back Bay Amtrak station and totally convenient. Classic Old Boston house converted into a hotel. The room was perfectly fine. Clean and comfortable.
Newbury Guest House,Jason,United States of America,1 review,December 15  2016,10,Water issues the day we were there but because the issue was addressed Immediately it had very little impact on our stay.,I needed to adjust my itenirary as well as a late check in and early check out. The staff were amazing. Accommodated my every need! Def recommend!
Newbury Guest House,Ruth,United States of America,1 review,December 12  2016,10,N/A,Fabulous bedding. lovely pillows - and lots of them.  Adored the bay window overlooking Newbury St.. as well as the fireplace with its historic mantle.Great coffee. midnight cookies - perfect.
Newbury Guest House,Jessica,United Kingdom,22 Reviews,December 5  2016,10,Sound proofing could have been a little better in the rooms (we could hear the neighbour's TV in the evening). although our sleep wasn't disturbed. Breakfast was alright. although more options and slightly later finish time would have been good!,Fantastic location on lovely street in Boston. Our room was a good size. Coffee available in the lobby all day. Staff very helpful and seemed to go the extra mile for guests.
Newbury Guest House,Paola,United States of America,3 Reviews,December 3  2016,9.2,Our room was big. but did not have a single drawer. We have been there 6 days + 3 = 9 days with all our things kept in the suitcases. Only a small closet with no drawers!Bathroom with not even a stool. No way to put anything anywhere. Space was big enough to have a chest in the room and some kind of stool and a little table or alike in the bathroom.,Croissants excellent. bed very good. Staff very very nice.
Newbury Guest House,Darrel,United States of America,1 review,November 22  2016,9.6,In room 408 there is a exhaust fan motor in the ceiling for the restaurant down stairs and it is very annoying when it is turned on,Will definitely return. but would make sure I got a room with a king sizes bed.You have a well run place. Everyone was very helpful and pleasant.
Newbury Guest House,David,Israel,18 Reviews,November 13  2016,8.3,The room we had was next to the elevator and a bit noisy. Refilling the dishes at breakfast was quite slow.,The room was big and comfortable. The location is great. but the best were Amanda and her colleague at the reception. What a great team !
Newbury Guest House,Stacey,United States of America,1 review,November 11  2016,8.8,A small thing: Although super clean. the towels and sheets could have used a bit of softening.,The room was immaculate and the bed was wonderful. We enjoyed our breakfast immensely. The sitting area downstairs was lovely and welcoming. I love the Back Bay and the location could not have been better.
Newbury Guest House,Karyn,United States of America,1 review,November 8  2016,9.2,Room was a bit warm with no way too adjust thermostat. A magnifying/make-up mirror in the bath would be helpful.,Loved this hotel.Feels more like an Inn than an hotel. Great value. clean. modern with very nice amenities. Free Wi-fi and delicious breakfast included. Unbeatable location for walking. dining and shopping. Historic Boston brownstone. Parking too! Enjoyed our stay and will return again.
Newbury Guest House,Derek,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,October 29  2016,9.2,Breakfast was OK. Just OK. it was handy but felt a bit more like a motel breakfast rather than a bed and breakfast breakfast !,The location was perfect  -right in the heart of the hustle and bustle . Reception staff were very courteous and helpful.
Newbury Guest House,MikeR1961,United Kingdom,1 review,October 23  2016,9.6,Was expensive. but to be expected in a New England city during 'Fall',Location was great-lots of restaurants. bars and shops within walking distance. Room was great. Very comfy bed. Short walk from the Logan airport express bus stop-easily manageable with a wheeled suitcase.
Newbury Guest House,Diana,United Kingdom,16 Reviews,October 20  2016,9.6,Breakfast is fairly poor. Buffet but rather cold and you have to ask for toast. It was better on my last stay two years ago,Fantastic location on a lovely street. The rooms actually look better than on their website. it is great value for money and the staff are delightful
Newbury Guest House,Anthony,Australia,10 Reviews,October 15  2016,9.6,Perhaps some fresh fruit and warm toast.,Breakfast was o.k. but only just.  I guess it is what you would expect for an all inclusive price.  Also. the hotel staff were great but I think the lady in the kitchen didn't really want to be there.
Newbury Guest House,Suzanne,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 9  2016,7.9,Breakfast at the adjoining Roost restaurant was chaotic. no staff available to show you to a table or explain the diff food options. though little disappointed with food choice.  For the price of hotel would've expected better standard than this!,Hotel staff very friendly and helpful.  Hotel rooms recently updated. clean and spacious - but padded toilet seats?? They belong in an old peoples home. not a boutique hotel!
Three-Bedroom on Hamilton Place Apt 305,Helen,United Kingdom,1 review,October 20  2017,8.3,The front bedroom was very noisy overnight. There seemed to be a degree of movement in the fitting of the window frames and this was definitely affecting the quality of sound proofing.  It may just need some maintenance.,The apartment was well located. clean. the bedding lovely and beds very comfortable. The bathroom facilities also superb.  We loved the stylish design and industrial feel of the interior.
Three-Bedroom on Hamilton Place Apt 305,Amy,United States of America,6 Reviews,October 16  2017,9.6,The only downside to staying in this apartment was the noise. The street below the windows is extremely loud with crosswalk sounds. drunk people every night until late and early constructions sounds. The upstairs neighbors also had a small child who would endlessly run back and forth being very loud.,Beds were very comfortable. the whole apartment was super clean and instructions to access were clear and simple. Everything we needed was there for us when we arrived. Location is conveniently close to the Park street station which makes it easy to get around. and so many things are in walking distance.
Three-Bedroom on Hamilton Place Apt 305,Konstantin,Germany,15 Reviews,July 18  2017,9.6,n/a,This stunning apartment is excellently located near all the main attractions in Boston.

Three-Bedroom on Hamilton Place Apt 305,Carol,United States of America,1 review,September 8  2017,10,A second comfie chair in the living room would be nice,Location was the best. More than enough room for five gals!
14 Gloucester Street #G by Lyon Apartments,Xia,China,1 review,September 8  2017,10,N/A,The room is pretty good. and is bigger than what I think.the bed is comfortable too!
112 Myrtle St #5 by Lyon Apartments,Martine,Netherlands,7 Reviews,October 29  2017,8.0,the place could use some maintenance. ceiling fan looked like it was about to fall off. radiator in bathroom was falling apart,good location. clean. convenient. good value for money
112 Myrtle St #5 by Lyon Apartments,Carol,United States of America,1 review,August 22  2017,10,N/A,The Apartment was clean. attractive and comfortable.  The host left snacks and plenty of cold drinks which were greatly appreciated.  It was a great visit. The location is perfect and next to dining options and shopping.  It is a super location.
112 Myrtle St #5 by Lyon Apartments,Linda,Ireland,6 Reviews,July 28  2017,7.1,On arrival. It would have been soo helpful to have had a free city map in the apt. also there wasn't any hairdryer. I did request one from the owner. but he said the cleaner was on a day off. and he still failed to get one to us for our entire stay. and the coffee machine was broken.,The area. close to everything. once you realised what part of town you were in.
112 Myrtle St #5 by Lyon Apartments,Aileen,United States of America,4 Reviews,June 20  2017,9.6,Getting the keys out and in the key box was a little hard/tricky.  Also with 4 Adults it would have been nice to have a couple of extra towels.,The location was perfect.  Close to the "T" and very walkable to just about anywhere.  Apartment was the perfect solution to staying in a hotel.   The neighborhood was beautiful and quiet with numerous places to eat and grab a cold beer.

One-Bedroom on Arch Street Apt 5D,Suzanne,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,April 10  2017,10,The only downside if I was to be picky would be the lack of view from our window really but we spent most of our time outdoors anyway!,Had everything we needed for our stay. fantastic find. plenty of room. liked the extras eg  coffee. tea. sugar. olive oil etc.
14 Gloucester Street by Lyon Apartments,Monica,Australia,3 Reviews,October 31  2017,10,I want sure if there was a lift or not. There's not. Lugging a 23kg (50lb) suitcase to the 3rd floor was a pain but didn't ruin the trip or anything. As a bonus "3rd floor apartment" is a while flight of stairs less than it is at home as the ground floor isn't counted.,The apartment was located in traditional Boston row housing which was delightful. It's also perfectly located to be able to walk a lot of the city. with public transport nearby for those longer trips. Located in the Back Bay area also means a good assortment of places for eating and drinking. The apartment was very private. clean and comfortable. with plenty of linen and towels. Wi-Fi was available and reliable and the owners were easy to communicate with.  providing simple. clear instructions for access. Boston is an expensive city for accommodation which made it value for money. I had a delightful stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay again.
14 Gloucester Street by Lyon Apartments,Peter,United Kingdom,23 Reviews,October 21  2017,5.8,We had been asked when we would arrive? And I said 1500 hrs: and we arrived to the minute. And was there anyone there? No. And so we tried hammering on the door: no reply. And tried our cellphones: no response as they did not work in the US. And so sent my wife out to accost a stranger: less threatening than me. All this time with a meter running down at $3.50 an hour: and the need to take our hire car back to the airport with a deadline.  And asked that they contact Mario. And she did bless her! Oh! Problems! I would be there in ten minutes: twenty five! And he let us in. And had sent the instructions for joining at 0900 hrs that day! When we were on the road and hence incommunicado. Not amused. And the description on Booking.com did not meet the reality. No dishwasher. no washing machine. no toaster. And where were the complimentary toiletries? Hidden behind a mirror and did Mario tell us this? What do you think? The owner has come back with some offer: but should do better.,I had booked the apartment from the description on Booking.com. And it was the location that I had liked having visited Boston before in 1994. And the location was good: drop off from the Logan Airport to Back Bay stop at Hynes Centre: and a two block walk. Ideal for the T to take us around Boston on Public Transport: a bit further away but not too far.
14 Gloucester Street by Lyon Apartments,Florian,Germany,2 Reviews,October 16  2017,7.5,Code doors were too easy and should be changed for every guest.,LocationQuick response to emails Accomendation is very nice.In summary. stay was very nice.
14 Gloucester Street by Lyon Apartments,Elena,Spain,16 Reviews,October 10  2017,8.3,There is one one to talk to in person. You open the door with a code. Never think about booking for more than 4 people.,The appartment is beautiful. The bed is very comfortable. The air matress was too but ir would lose air through the night
14 Gloucester Street by Lyon Apartments,Felipe,Colombia,9 Reviews,August 14  2017,8.8,All light bulbs should be working (bathroom). Only 1 set of sheets and blankets for sofa bed.,Great Location. Very recommended.We received full collaboration from owner who helped us a lot with the late check out.
14 Gloucester Street by Lyon Apartments,Winfred,United States of America,1 review,August 4  2017,9.6,Not enough convenient electrical receptacles for charging electronic devices.A few more lamps for reading would certainly be helpful.,Quiet location and walkable neighborhood in a tastefully renovated building.
14 Gloucester Street by Lyon Apartments,Glenn,New Zealand,14 Reviews,July 19  2017,8.3,Cost . but then the apartment is in Back Bay!Could do with more kitchen utensils and a jug.Apartment on third floor. so a hike to carry bags but not really a problem  if fit and healthy. No lift etc.,Great location in Back Bay. Close to restaurants and shopping area. Transit close by and short stroll to Charles river and walking paths.  Very close to Hynes convention centre.Good markets within walking distance. Easy to collect keys via lockbox for late arrival.
14 Gloucester Street by Lyon Apartments,Prue,United States of America,1 review,June 10  2017,9.6,Blackout curtains are needed in the bedroom - we were woken each morning around 5 because of the light.  Although we checked the number of stairs and were assured that there were only 20 to the apartment we were actually on the 3rd floor with 40 narrow steps. This made it difficult to get luggage up and down. and for my partner who has severe knee issues.,Location was terrific - easy to get to shopping and restaurants.  Apartment was clean. bed was comfortable. although the kitchen was tiny and did not have a dishwasher.
14 Gloucester Street by Lyon Apartments,Nate,United States of America,1 review,April 14  2017,9.6,The lock box for the key is super hard to on &amp; off. Took us 30mins each time to get and push back.,The room is amazing. the location is exceptional.
14 Gloucester Street by Lyon Apartments,Meghan,United States of America,11 Reviews,October 29  2016,9.2,Communication with property manager/ owner could really be improved.,Awesome location in the heart of Boston. Cute apartment with basic amenities and comfortable sleeping accommodations (bed. pull out couch &amp; air mattress). Great apartment for a solo traveler or group of friends.
14 Gloucester Street by Lyon Apartments,Cindia,Canada,3 Reviews,October 10  2016,7.5,we stayed on the 3rd level of building too heavy to carry all our luggage to the unit,good location in Black Bay area. close to shops. park and transit
14 Gloucester Street by Lyon Apartments,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 23  2016,7.9,Front door to building not always locked or completely closed.,Good location. Refrig contained ample supply of beverages. Nice kitchen appliances
Taj Boston,Siyao,China,13 Reviews,November 2  2017,6.7,I asked the room service staff to provide a pot for boiling water. After three calls and about 2hours. they bring me a wrong one......,The location is good and there are so many shops around the corner. The room is very big.
Taj Boston,Rebecca,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,November 1  2017,10,Nothing. everything was perfect!,The Taj Boston was a beautiful place to stay! So clean and well kept. luxurious and in a great location. The staff were all immensely friendly and really made us feel welcome. Absolutely loved it and would definitely stay here again!
Taj Boston,Leda,Switzerland,7 Reviews,October 26  2017,7.1,I had booked a room with two double beds and got given a room with one double bed so had to have a roll-away bed for my son as they didn't have any more of the two bed rooms. Not ideal. Also where Booking.com said I would pay $2.036 plus taxes. the total came to $2.439. as. on top of the taxes. there was a "facility" charge of $30 per day. Why not just tell us up front what we will pay??,Good gym and excellent business centre with a printer.
Taj Boston,Sabine,Switzerland,5 Reviews,October 24  2017,9.0,The price of the room service... you always end up bu getting to pay the double than the marked price once it is is the room. Too expensive!,Free coffee in the lobby.Usally friendly service
Taj Boston,Alana,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 24  2017,8.3,On check our we discovered a hefty $120.00 car parking fee which we weren’t told about. It was rather a shock and would have appreciated this being made clear during the booking process.,Great hotel. excellent location and beautiful rooms. The bar staff were extremely friendly and gave us lots of tips off places to visit. The people in the room next to us were playing loud music on the early hours and again first thing so the hotel changed our room and upgraded us.
Taj Boston,Anonymous,Chile,39 Reviews,October 21  2017,3.8,I had booked four nights at the Taj Boston for a visit in mid October. Upon arrival I was struck by the worn and stained rugs in the halls and corridors. The room was a small suite with old furniture. an a small TV set.  but the bed was a nice king size. The room was clean. No coffee or tea in the room. which  surprised me as in standard hotels which go for a third of the price of the Taj Boston you get complimentary coffee and tea in the room.Up to that point. given what I have written above I thought that value for money the hotel was expensive since I was being charged close to $500 dollars per night.But the worst part of the our experience at the Boston Taj came later  that night. While getting ready for sleep. my wife  complained that the room was cold. The outside temperature that day in Boston  had been in the mid 50’s  but later on - at night - it was in the mid 40’s. I called the reception desk to complain and was told the central heating system was off. because the management of the hotel considered it was not cold enough yet in Boston to connect the heating!!!! To solve the problem . the clerk  sent an engineer with a portable electric heater. I have attached a picture of the electric fan they sent to my room. It worked reasonably well as the temperature in the room went up. I find the whole incident unacceptable. It is obvious that a five star hotel like the Taj Boston should be run to the full satisfaction of guests and management should not be trying  to save money at the expense of passengers.I decided I would not stay one more night at the hotel.  As I had complained to Booking about the problem. they negotiated with the hotel  for the penalty for an early check out to be cancelled. The clerk in the reception desk apologized when I checked out. but that was all. I’ll never stay at a Taj hotel again.,Nothing
Taj Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 18  2017,9.6,I needed warm water in middle of night and at 6:00am but there was no hot water.,I loved the housekeeper who came in evening bringing water. ice and slippers.
Taj Boston,Laura,United States of America,1 review,October 15  2017,8.3,The heat in my room didn't work. It they brought a portable room heater,Location is perfect for walking around Boston.  Great restaurants are nearThey are also pet friendlyStaff was courteous and always had smiles on their faces.
Taj Boston,Carroll,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 13  2017,8.8,The restaurant menu prices were out of line and the selections were not to Our tastes ----- too much curry powder!Overall prices seemed high including room and parking rates.,The view from our room was very good and we felt very safe in our surroundings.
Taj Boston,Melissa,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 11  2017,7.5,Got baggage all confused on last day of checkOut. Staff was very unclear which bags belonged to which client ineft luggage area,Concierge Nathalie was superb
Taj Boston,Corinne,United States of America,4 Reviews,October 9  2017,5.0,Bed was unbelievably uncomfortable. we actually slept on the sofa in our executive suite since the bed was so bad.  The bathroom was so small I dropped all of my toiletries several times trying to get ready for dinner. Two of us could not get ready at the same time. At nearly $1.000 a night. we were so disappointed. Rowdy wedding guests also brought down the sophistication factor and the elevators were so slow that we had to wait 25 minutes at one point to get to our room on the 12th floor. The opportunity for the property to offer improvements presented itself when we communicated these issues to the hotel. but nothing was offered until after we checked out and we're not our way home.,Staff was very friendly. room service was on time and delicious. Check in and out was a breeze.
Taj Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 8  2017,9.6,See above.   Dinner was excellent.,Breakfast was not good.   Sausage not cooked well. eggs tasted like powdered eggs. potatoes hard  possibly. It cooked wl enough.   Did not eat very much because I found it not good.  Coffee was good.
Taj Boston,Hans,Switzerland,5 Reviews,October 2  2017,9.2,There could be more space in the bathrooms for keeping things.,The location is perfect. The hotel itself very pleasant and attractive. The service was excellent.
Taj Boston,La Vida Travel,United Kingdom,25 Reviews,September 17  2017,8.8,Initially in 1419 (14th floor). All the 19 suites are tucked in the back. Poor light and noise from the A/C units mounted on the 4th floor roof.,The suite we were moved to on the corner at the front of the hotel was awesome. Views over the park. Initially we were in a suite at the back and asked to be moved. Same room type. slightly less tired but a world of difference. These rooms are normally extra but they upgraded us for free. See view from room attached.

Taj Boston,Anonymous,Turkey,1 review,September 12  2017,6.3,Terrible concierge services. Wrong table booking very expensive rental car offer etc. Food in hotel restaurants needs to improved.,Location is perfect. Efficient front desk very quick check out.
Taj Boston,Deb,United States of America,1 review,September 11  2017,9.6,We got in really late and left very early so it is hard to really judge facilities. The only things I didn't like were that on the 14th floor I could hear the wedding going on above and with my eyes the print on the toiletries is too small to read on the bathroom to tell one item from another,We were checked in quickly and easily and welcomed in our room on our honeymoon with champagne and strawberries.
Taj Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 7  2017,10,No easily-available. reasonably-priced parking - we took our rental back to the airport instead of parking there. Luckily. we found that we didn't even miss having a car!  It was probably easier NOT to have a car.,Bed was very comfortable. the room was spotless!
Taj Boston,Caroline,France,10 Reviews,September 5  2017,8.8,Bathroom too small compared to the bedroomNo coffee in room.

Taj Boston,Amanda,Bermuda,4 Reviews,August 28  2017,8.3,Suggest considering providing carafes for drinking water in each room and a water fountain on each floor - ie no more plastic bottles. Also. a tea/coffee maker in the room would be great!,We much enjoyed bright. comfortable. and clean room with its view over the park. Bar and restaurant staff were delightful - and front desk helpful and efficient.

Taj Boston,Richard,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,August 19  2017,6.3,Tea and coffee making facilities should be a standard in the room. Shouldn't need to ask to have them.,Great location. and on the whole an enjoyable stay.
Taj Boston,Lr,United Kingdom,1 review,August 19  2017,5.8,After requesting our car from valet parkers. they didn't inform us when the car was at front of hotel (despite us sitting in lobby with two young children. clearly anxious to get going). This resulted in a half hour delay for our departure.,N/A
Taj Boston,Robert,United States of America,1 review,August 16  2017,10,I saw two of the doors to model rooms under consideration... Please do not upgrade to this modern style..of entryway and hall.....Raj  will lose unique elegance and become like other high end chain hotels.. I do not think you need this lighter décor to attract younger generations.....stay with elegance. service. and subtle grandeur and tradition.....,excellent service . food in restaurant; excellent housekeeping - very pleasant. concierge very knowledgeable and accommodating. very quiet ( overlooking Commonwealth)...excellent room  737 with two beds...
Taj Boston,Mike,United States of America,1 review,August 15  2017,5.8,The pillows were lousy. On our first day the shower kept going from hot to cold without turning the spigot. On the second day we had no cold water and the toilet tank was empty. In order to use it I had to use the trash can from the bathroom to pour hot water from the tub into the tank to flush. At least 7 times.,N/A

Taj Boston,Mark,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,August 14  2017,8.3,Room wasn't ready when we tried to check in at 3pm although it was ready about an hour or so later. During the spare time we were able to explore the area close by including Boston park.,The beds were very comfortable and room was spacious nicely decorated.The location is very good - opposite Boston common which is a great place to explore. Shops and Freedom Trail walk around Boston are also reasonably close by.Staff were both friendly and very helpful.
Taj Boston,Erica R,Australia,11 Reviews,August 14  2017,9.6,The lighting in the bathroom was a bit too dull.  Would have liked coffee/tea making in room,The location was good. the room was a good size. clean &amp; bed was very comfortable.
Taj Boston,Robert,United States of America,4 Reviews,August 14  2017,8.8,See above.,Bathroom door made loud noise when opening &amp; closing.   Toilet was " running ".  At 5:30 P.M. ...only Luke warm shower. Room itself was lovely.   Always LOVE your bar. Breakfast excellent. as well as dining room service.
Taj Boston,Ms,United States of America,1 review,August 12  2017,7.5,The lobby &amp; hallways had a stale odor and the place felt tired. Stains on carpet. chips in marble floor. dirty stain in our toilet. one of our sink stoppers was stuck so the sink did not drain. and every night the rate for the room was vastly different by hundreds of dollars. The photos of Lady Gaga modeling Tiffany jewelry all over the lobby were not appealing. It was inconvenient to use the lobby  bathroom in the basement and one on the toilets was stuffed up for hours in the women's restroom.,The location is great and we had a wonderful view. Very friendly &amp; helpful staff. The gym had tons of free cold water. fresh fruit &amp; headphones. The elevators were fast.
Taj Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 10  2017,7.1,We were nibbled on by bugs - all over our legs and ankles. We finally got moved to a new room. But only after getting lots of bites.,Location was great!
Taj Boston,Erol,Turkey,10 Reviews,August 7  2017,10,Although this has been our 4th stay with the hotel. they did not greet us accordingly and acted as if our first time.I would have expected a gesture of customer loyalty,looking through the park. very close to everywhere. spacious rooms with very comfortable beds

Taj Boston,Jonathan,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 2  2017,10,Nothing. Everything was wonderful.,Everything was beyond what we expected. The staff was polite. friendly. and helpful.  The view from our room was like a picture both in the day and at night to look at the Gardens and Boston skyline. Our room was comfortable. clean. peaceful. The hotel's location was ideal to take the subway system to historical sites. popular locations in Boston. and restaurants. or a walk through the Gardens.
Taj Boston,Patricia,United States of America,1 review,July 31  2017,9.6,I think parking should be complimentary.  Also the added fees and taxes were quite a bit more than anticipated.  Perhaps those charges should be stated with more clarity on the website.,Ambience of old Boston. Courteous staff. Location.location.location.
Taj Boston,Elizabeth,United States of America,1 review,July 31  2017,9.6,Could Improve soundproofing between neighboring bathrooms. Can hear toilet flush.,excellent location with beautiful view. Convenient to all areas of interest downtown.
Taj Boston,Anonymous,Canada,1 review,July 30  2017,9.6,Some room features (light switches. bathroom telephone) looked 40 years old.  Definitely faded glory.,Beds were very comfortable. Staff was very friendly.
Taj Boston,Anonymous,New Zealand,1 review,July 28  2017,8.3,Shower water temperature fluctuated constantly. Every 30 sec. have to adjust all the time. Old. dirty worn carpet and cracked bathroom tiles. Weird noisy humming sounds in room.,Location fantastic .  Big room.
Taj Boston,Pa,United States of America,1 review,July 25  2017,8.8,Eggs tasted like they came from a box.When I booked there were no rooms with 2 beds.I got multiple emails with an offer for $15 to get a room with 2 beds. When we arrived we were told there were none. Why offer what you do not have?We asked for a cot and within a 1/2 hour canceled it in person. We put a do not disturb sign on our door and went out.We came back and housekeeping had gone into our room with the cot over the do not disturb sign.I went to the desk to complain. The clerk asked me to see the manger. He went to get Michael. When he came out he helped a man who stepped in front of me for a prolonged time. I expressed my displeasure with the clerk and later with Michael. He would never have done that if I had been a man waiting. I did not make a fuss in front of the rude visitor. I explained to the manager what had happened. I asked what he was going to do about it. He said he had to check the key code records with housekeeping. I felt like he did not believe me. He said he would get back to me the next afternoon. I said that was too late. That evening he called to confirm that some one had been in the room. The cot was still there and later was finally removed. He agreed to cover our breakfast as a token. In addition the toilet did not work and that night we needed the plumber. He fixed it partially but it never worked properly.Breakfast was fine but not 4 star quality.The location was very good. It is too bad that there is no on site parking.BJ,Bacon was nice and crispy
Taj Boston,Michael,United States of America,1 review,July 17  2017,8.8,The maintenance on the hotel is being let go. and that is a sign that there may be problems in the future.,The staff was very friendly and always willing to go the extra step.
Taj Boston,Lori,United States of America,7 Reviews,July 13  2017,9.6,The toilet would not flush and it took 3 phone call and over 45 min to have fixed first thing in the morning.,The room was nice and large. We upgraded to get this room with a view of Commonwealth Ave and Back Bay.
Taj Boston,R hau,Indonesia,5 Reviews,July 13  2017,9.2,Nothing.,Location was soooo good. I love that it is right across the park. We walked to chinatown to get a meal and it took us around 10 minutes. We were there on 4th of July. it was nice to be able to walk to where we can get a glimpse of the fireworks and walk back without having to worry about parking.  We did get an upgrade to a suite and that was a surprise for us. My girls enjoyed their stay so much that Taj is their favorite hotel for this summer holiday.
Taj Boston,Vladimir,Russia,2 Reviews,July 8  2017,3.3,I had the worst hotel experience with Taj Boston. Stay there for 2 nights. Used Laundry - one item (the most valuable) didn't come back. Called 5 times to hotel. wrote a lot of emails. only one response - we are so sorry - and then silince! No customer care at all!No looking for advocate - No recommendation to stay there at all!,N/A
Taj Boston,Patsy,United States of America,1 review,July 7  2017,7.1,The bathroom was small and there was no vanity space; strictly a one person bath. And. the lighting was terrible!The AC in our room did not cool enough for me.Complimentary coffee should have been available! Guests should not have to pay $6.00 for a cup!!,The location was the best. The staff were friendly &amp; helpful.
Taj Boston,Heidi,United States of America,1 review,July 7  2017,9.6,N/A,Nice size rooms. beds were comfortable and all staff friendly especially the front entrance workers.  They were also very helpful about the area and where to go.
Taj Boston,Bill,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 7  2017,10,We didn't rent a car so walking along a narrow path by the busy road is very unattractive.,To room was fully equipped like an apartment. Town retail facilities are good.
Taj Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 6  2017,6.3,Seemed a bit dirty. dated. and they didn't service / turn down our room for one day despite us calling several times about it.  Amenities weren't great.  Expected more from such a famous name.  Oh. and coffee was not good.,Staff super friendly.  Old worldly charm of hotel.  Location couldn't be better.  Eggs were delish.  Follow up post stay was incredible and eager to hear feedback.
Taj Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 6  2017,7.1,There needs to be updates in the hotel. There were holes in the bed skirts and the carpets looked old. Also. for an upscale hotel. there were very few amenities included. No coffee maker. microwave. refrigerator.,You cannot beat the location. Perfect. Bell service and maid service was very nice.
Taj Boston,Dyann,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 6  2017,5.0,The fact that the air conditioning was broke and no one told us. We just thought it was just our room. But after talking to other residents learned they were offered fans .  For the price I paid someone should have stood next to my bed and fanned me. Almost 100 dollars in different taxes,Everything was good except no air conditioning  toilet stopped up upon arrival and bathroom sink stopper wouldn't come out of closed position
Taj Boston,Linda,United States of America,4 Reviews,July 5  2017,5.4,Dingy appearance throughout the hotel.  The plumbing was also problematic.   The dining room staff were unsmiling and unhappy people which made breakfast unpleasant.,The bed and pillows were great
Taj Boston,Krystan,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 4  2017,5.4,Found food on the floor an hair in the tub upon checking in. after having to wait for a manager to inspect the room.  The parking cost $53 a day in addition to the room rate.  $8.00 for a peanut butter and jelly on stale bread.,The size of the room was great. Especially for a family with a young child.  Great location!
Taj Boston,James,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,July 4  2017,9.6,Stroller access to and from the building was a two person job using a non automatic door on the Newbury Street side. This should be improved by installing automatic wheelchair friendly doors.,The view from the 14th floor over the public gardens was beautiful and you could see the gold roof of the State House.
Taj Boston,Manohar,Qatar,4 Reviews,June 28  2017,6.7,1)Most of the Front desk staff  need refresher courses in  customer handling. specifically telephone etiquette. You don't have to Take .myword for it. Pls call and find out for yourself . 2) experienced slip ups in billing. ( charged twice for inroom bar consumption)( also important to add that the issue was resolved efficiently once I complained)3) I had to follow up for toiletries. 4)requested early checkin. was promised a call back when the room was ready. never got the call .      5) no tea/coffee maker.       Overall. numerous minor slip ups that one doesn't expect from a TAJ Hotel,Great location. spacious rooms
Taj Boston,Laura,United States of America,6 Reviews,June 27  2017,7.5,The entire hotel was so hot and muggy! We asked for our AC to be fixed but they gave us a fan instead! Our room was on the 16th floor right below the meeting/ reception space so the entire time we were there they were moving tables and chairs. It was a nightmare!,Bed was comfortable. staff was nice. great bartenders!
Taj Boston,John,Greece,3 Reviews,June 26  2017,7.1,The air conditioning. both in the the rooms and public areas of the hotel was not working  properly. Too hot.

Taj Boston,Eimear,Ireland,1 review,June 26  2017,8.8,I mentioned a big birthday celebration when booking originally but this was not referred to by reception.

Taj Boston,Richard,United States of America,1 review,June 21  2017,10,Just wish the restaurant prices were more reasonable. If so. we would have dined there. but went outside to dine instead.,Beautiful hotel and very comfortable room. We arrived around 9 am and we were checked into our room. We were also given a high floor room and checkout at noon.  Great location and price for Boston.
Taj Boston,William,United States of America,1 review,June 20  2017,7.5,The air conditioning system is totally inadequate. My room was quite warm as was the lobby and the restaurant. The thermostat in the lobby said it was 75 degrees although it was set at 65.,N/A
Taj Boston,Melissa,United States of America,1 review,June 19  2017,10,N/A,The bed was amazing. Our flight got in very early morning and we were able to get an early checkIn as soon as we got there. We also received a complimentary late check out. Very friendly and helpful staff.

Taj Boston,Cosmos,United States of America,1 review,June 12  2017,7.5,See above.,Bathroom lighting very poor.  Only light was over sink.  Dark in the shower.  Had trouble getting our luggage to the room.  It never came after almost two hours after we checked in. Needed bags for the evening events.  I personally went to retrieve it myself and carried it to my room.  The bellhop mumbled something that they were under staffed. He offered to bring it to my room but I was so upset I said NO. He mubbled again something that I could not hear.  That placed a poor taste to the stay.

Global Luxury Suites at Fenway,Deniz,Turkey,10 Reviews,January 6  2017,10,We needed a late check-out and admittedly it was until 6 pm - and were charged the full day- which I can't really argue about- but having stayed for two weeks. the amount of bureaucracy the management put us through was very annoying- Clinton saved the day again though..,excellent location-  24hr. Target right next to the entrance door and a Star Market acros the road make life so easy. There is also a Marshalls behind the hotel. Staples and cinemas round the corner- loads of excellent food within a few steps- Basho (sushi). Sweet Cheeks (Texan cuisine) etc.. great views. very comfortable rooms with everything you need- Staff are beyond helpful and especially Ken at reception and Clinton are very professional. pleasant and make you feel at home- The decor is lovely- the washer and dryer are so great to have in the rooms- mattresses are very comfortable. I can't rave enough about it. Within seconds of Prudential. only  10 dollar cab ride from Wharf area. Even the welcome package with cloth dishes. washing powder. toilet paper. etc etc are just very thoughtful things that make you comfortable when you arrive tired after a long journey. This will be our home away from home whenever we visit Boston from now on
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway,Judy,Germany,2 Reviews,December 30  2016,8.8,The staff in fact did not do anything. 1. We managed to drop the bag early before the check-in on the phone. he did not show up to the meeting point. 2. when we asked something related to the bill (am writing an email to the company and I hope they do me a little favour). he said 'no problem' and of course he did not do anything.3. for the check out. we asked if it s possible to keep our bag somewhere he said he will talk to building staffs so that we could leave our bags in his office for a while (that is very nice) and of course he did not mention anything to the reception people. I guess that staff needs to do his work??,It was a very nice flat and comfy to stay.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway,Helmut,United States of America,1 review,December 19  2016,8.8,King bed would be better. Queen bed is too small.,Great location. The staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly. The unit was clean and efficient. Lots of space.

Global Luxury Suites at Fenway,Kathy,United States of America,1 review,November 15  2016,9.6,I was given an envelope with a key fob and directions on the front door to leave all keys in an envelope on the door with no one to turn them in to. A week after I returned home j get an email saying they can't find the keys and I might be charged. I didn't know I was to get anything other than the one fob. and I left the only one I was given. Needs to be a better way to prove you turn it in.,It was really clean with a beautiful view from the rooftop. The people were very nice.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway,Amber,United States of America,1 review,November 4  2016,9.2,The staff wasn't very knowledgeable about parking.. told me it was $7 to park over night. so of course I did. but as I'm leaving the next morning turns out I had to pay $64 .... definitely not expected and when I brought it to the front desks attention nobody could help.,The property was beautiful. very clean. spacious. great laction. amazing view and came with amenities I didn't consider needing but did. The location was perfect as well and everything I could think of needing was in walking distance. All in all. I'm definitely returning.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway,Jennifer,United States of America,1 review,October 24  2016,7.1,It took 2  days into our 4 day stay to get a response back to be able to get the wifi code.

Global Luxury Suites at Fenway,Lendy,United States of America,1 review,October 9  2016,9.2,Bed was not that soft. the pillows were perfect.Too much construction in the area at the time.,Location was good for what I was wanting to do. Didn't need a car for anything. Grocery store was close by.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway,Shelina,United Arab Emirates,4 Reviews,October 5  2016,6.7,The amenities provided were enough for just one-time use only. Not enough if I needed a second shower or needed to run another wash!,The size of the apartment was very good. So was the location.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway,Triyatni,United States of America,4 Reviews,October 3  2016,8.8,The problem is you only can check in after 4pm. It would be very hard for us who live overseas with international flight which sometime comes around noon or before noon. One staff at the front office didn't even try to help me to store my big luggage when I arrived before 4pm and he didn't even seem care about it. Another problem is with amount of money we spend to rent the room we didn't get cleaning service till we check out.,It's a great place to stay especially when you have kids go to college around that area. Super clean
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway,Therese,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 16  2016,8.3,It was two of us friends traveling. we needed separate beds. there were no linens for the sleeper sofa and a call to the contact number told us to go buy a blanket and they would reimburse us!

Global Luxury Suites at Fenway,James,United States of America,7 Reviews,June 21  2016,6.7,Wasn't able to get my booking.com Genius late checkout because "they had checkins".The day of checkout I had a later flight and asked them to store my luggage. They refused due to "liability". I called customer service but it was only a call center answering service who wasn't able to do anything for me other than leave a message (there was no contact info for my specific problem). I spent 20 minutes looking for alternatives before I called back more forcefully and they were suddenly able to help me (by opening my room back up and giving me late checkout).,N/A
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway,Ohoud,Saudi Arabia,1 review,April 26  2016,3.8,We planned to stay for a week. when we arrived the apartment was not clean ( hair in the bathroom. the floor of the living room was dirty). we ask them to clean it. they came 2 days later and they said they could not clean as our personal items were in the apartment !!!!!! and they cant touch any of them. The worst part of our stay is; due to an emergency situation we had to leave earlier than the check out date. we tried to contact many managers soooooo many times and no body responded to our calls neither voice massages. 4 days later they send us email stating as per their policy. they cant return our money back. We do respect and understand the policies. but they should responde to our calls earlier and in professional way. I will never stay with them again nor recommend this apartments to anyone,Location
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway,Yvette,United States of America,3 Reviews,April 15  2016,9.6,The T stop is a little out of the way and then you need to change trains 2-3 times.,Overall the amenities and apt were perfect.

Global Luxury Suites at Fenway,Mitzi,United States of America,1 review,February 16  2016,10,Curtains in addition to the mini blinds would be nice.,We needed to be near Brigham and Women's hospital and this was perfect. Just a few steps away is Target with a pharmacy &amp; Starbucks which were great. Nearby there are several restaurants and a grocery store. We could walk to everything we needed in about 10-15 minutes including the Museum of Fine Arts.It was furnished with everything we needed. was comfortable. clean &amp; quiet.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway,Nicolas,Luxembourg,1 review,February 2  2016,9.2,N/A,This apartment was very well situated. in the heart of Fenway . less than a ten minute walk to the Kenmore T station that could bring you to Downtown in around 15 mins. fast and convenient. The apartment building is also just next to a big Target and a Supermarket so this made food shopping quiet easy. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to be in a quiet neighborhood with easy access to downtown.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway,Kammie,Bermuda,1 review,December 22  2015,9.2,The mattresses aren't comfortable and a two bedroom apartment has televisions with basic cable channels (no movie channel) in the master bedroom and living room. Would have been better and more convenient to have another TV in the second bedroom.,The location. security. cleanliness. decor and amenities were superb.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway,Claudia,Brazil,3 Reviews,December 11  2015,7.1,The hair dryer was burnt. They are not very organized with the bookings. I had just arrived in the New England Aquarium and I received a phone call from a woman saying that I had to do the checkout. although I had booking (paid) the apartment for 6 days and I had 3 days more to be there. I got desperate and I had to go back to the apartament and I received an email telling me that she had made a mistake. It was very bad.,The apartment is very nice and modern and it is relatively close to the metro station. There is a supermarket almost in front and also a coffee shop.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway,Oiana,Spain,5 Reviews,December 7  2015,10,Nothing,Everything was perfect.

112 Myrtle St #1 by Lyon Apartments,Ray_Fraser,United Kingdom,9 Reviews,August 29  2017,8.3,Only one small negative is that one of the bedrooms &amp; its windows are on street level. so any people passing by and chatting sound like they are in your bedroom. also parking may be a problem if staying with a car as the parking is permit holders only and has a strict 'tow zone' if failure to display. but with everything within walking distance including public transport then a car shouldn't be necessary.,The apartment is in a great location for Boston. right in the heart of Beacon Hill with its quaint historical narrow streets &amp; old lamplight's. antique shops &amp; bars yet only 10 mins walk into the heart of downtown Boston and all it has to offer.Boston common is another 10 mins walk to the right (down Joy St) where you can pick up the start of the famous Boston Freedom Trail. also within easy walking distance to the subway stations (Park Subway Station (red/green line) is on the Boston Common).The apartment has two good size bedrooms. though the one down the stairs is open to the noise above but wasn't a problem for us. It has all you need for a short stay but if you're planning a long stay here the apartment could become a bit claustrophobic. but with all Boston has to offer we didn't spend too much time in the place.
112 Myrtle St #1 by Lyon Apartments,Catherine,Canada,2 Reviews,August 8  2017,7.5,A little small for 4 adults. good for a long weekend but would be difficult for longer than that,Location- close to everything. Clean and we'll appointed.
112 Myrtle St #1 by Lyon Apartments,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,May 23  2017,5.8,All windows but 1 were painted shut. Given the outside temperature of over 90. that made the unit almost unbearably hot. The host did bring over a cooling device once informed of the problem. which I believe the host should have been aware of. Windows were very dirty and could use a good cleaning.Floor tiles in front of the sink had broken grout which caused some of the small tiles to be loose or break loose.,Good location with walking distance access to the Red and Green lines.

Bluebird Suites In The Heart of Fenway,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 9  2017,6.7,No cleaning services like hotels have.  This is an apartment building with mostly college students living here.,Location was good.  Close to train station.
Bluebird Suites In The Heart of Fenway,Mansour0,United Arab Emirates,16 Reviews,September 21  2017,5.0,Even though that I am a frequent traveler and a very flexible and adaptable person to new places. this has been the worst experience l ever been through. the apartment wasn't so clean. it was dusty like crazy. even though I cleaned it every day dust still accumulates over everything. found a large pile of dust under the bed so I used the vacuum cleaner which literally spills out dust more than it vacuums and which also produces odious odors when turned on! The dishwasher leaked some water after using it at the end of the day and I spent hours rinsing the water so the parquet flooring won't soak water and get damaged. It was really an overwhelming frustrating 14 days that I would not forget.,Location
Bluebird Suites In The Heart of Fenway,Tim,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 11  2017,9.2,The 4 o'clock check-in time in 11 o'clock check out time are very challenging for anything you want to do around the city.  We arrive from Southern California at 7 AM on a red eye.  We were at the property at 8:15 AM. We were dealing with the front desk/concierge and they were not able to help us with luggage storage or any other types of items regarding the property. That is handled by a separate group that was not available. We left multiple message.  We left multiple messages the day before with the extension where we were told there was an on-site person.  We waited at the property until  included finding a local breakfast place until 10:00AM.  Called and left multiple messages.  No one called us back. We had to drag our luggage around to all the sightseeing areas we had to go to. It was very frustrating!  The cell service is not spectacular in that area and you don't get your emails and stuff very well.  Apparently bluebird suites had sent us an email at 9:40AM in the morning saying that we could call to people and their cell phone numbers.  Unfortunately we didn't receive those emails until late in the afternoon after we had checked in at 4 PM. The frustrating part is we left multiple messages and the concierge told me that the gentleman who is on site was there 15 minutes after we left the property. He never returned any of our phone calls!  When we finally got on site at 4:00 PM. We called the gentleman and asked if we could leave our luggage on Sunday with him. He stated that they were not there on Sundays and there was nothing he could do about that. So once again it was a huge dilemma trying to get our luggage taken care of.,The location was great. The Building concierge was nice but not very helpful. The unit was Clean and ready when it was check in time. There were lots of food options and night life options close to the property.
Bluebird Suites In The Heart of Fenway,Keith,United States of America,1 review,September 10  2017,9.6,Shower drain was too slow. The water was over my ankles before I was done showering. I didnt take a long shower nor did I rush...if that helps.,Location
Bluebird Suites In The Heart of Fenway,Moyuan,Canada,17 Reviews,August 30  2017,4.6,too much reason to not live this apartment again . clenning for the room is horrible ! all the washroom has the same feeling that means when you see it and you never want to use on it . and most important things is about mattess  !!! listen carefully now . this apartment staff should be very nice and patience before you made the full payment . one you paid and get the key from the room that means you on your own now ! i was try to make 3 or 4 times call to complaint about the room cleanliness and mattess but never got anything call back !!!,loction is just ok and nothing eles to talk about .

Bluebird Suites In The Heart of Fenway,Karen,United States of America,1 review,August 19  2017,9.2,We arrived after 5pm due to traffic and there were no instructions on where to go to meet the concierge if you arrive later than you told them you would. We had to call the emergency contact number (which was a centralized corporate number) and have them call service at another building down the street. That exchange would have been better if they just gave us the contact in for the main building down the street.,The view from the apartment was spectacular!
Bluebird Suites In The Heart of Fenway,Scott,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,July 12  2017,6.7,I have stayed in apartments in this area before (last time I was here. I stayed in one right down the street) and I really enjoyed the area. The other apartments I have stayed in included parking in the building.  This one did not. So. although it did say that parking could be extra. it was $50 on two of the days I was there because of concerts at Fenway.  There was no type of discount if you were staying there. it was just you paid the extra if you wanted to park there.  This is something that could have been brought to my attention beforehand.The apartment was nice but the walls are due for a painting as there are scuff marks all over.Also. I have been charged a different rate than what I booked for and I am working on the difference with Booking.com.  I have sent three emails to the owners of the property and they have yet to respond.16 July 2017 - This is a follow up to my original write up.  I never had any response from the company I booked the property through.  I ended up having to call booking.com to get clarity on everything.  I live in the UK and typically. when you book a place at a price it is inclusive of tax.  There is a %14.45 tax that is added to your stay and a $75 cleaning fee.  I missed this in the fine print of my booking. The tax is a lot. Even the booking.com representative agreed on this point.  I do not mind a cleaning fee and even the tax but I never even received a finalised bill for my stay.  and I have tried to contact the management company several times to get some clarity but I have yet to receive a direct response.  I used to live in Boston and I love this city.  I have been frequent to the area now about twice a year.  What I would say to all of this is. there are a lot of similar properties like this apartment right around the corner (I have stayed at a few of these also).  Do yourself a favor. go to one of the others and avoid some of the hassle presented by this management company.,This is a nice apartment in a great location.
Bluebird Suites In The Heart of Fenway,David,United States of America,4 Reviews,June 30  2017,5.8,It was an apartment.  There were no hotel amenities available.  It would have been suitable if I had been  traveling alone for business but it wasn't a good fit for my family. There was only 1 towel in room and no one to call to ask for more.  It was so light in the apartment at 5am that we were awake for the whole day thereafter.  The $75 cleaning fee seemed excessive. The sofa bed was not comfortable.,Amazing neighborhood and walking distance to Fenway Park and Prudential Center.
Bluebird Suites In The Heart of Fenway,Antonella,United States of America,3 Reviews,May 29  2017,6.3,Booking said (posted) check in was at 1:00. the property manager contacted me after I purchased (1day later) that we couldn't check in until 4:15?? We had a Red Sox game at 4:05. It was IMPOSSIBLE to get through the process in under an hour because first. the concierge took the woman after us BEFORE is to her room. Then he came down after and said. "oh. I'm sorry...I thought all of you were together that's why I took them"...not sure why because they walked in through the door after us. We got to the game 1.5 hours late. Upset is not the word. Additionally. although the room was nice and most of it was clean...the bathroom had hair on the floor and in the shower along with a small smear of what looked like dried blood. Eek. we travel a lot...really easy to please but in this case. they hit 2 weak spots...I'm a clean freak and I missed half of the game. NEVER again.,Nice apartment.

InterContinental Boston,Max,United States of America,1 review,August 23  2017,9.2,VERY expensive room service including a high service charge and included tip (two small boxes of cereal plus a coffee amounted to more than $25 -- better to find a local cafe!);Staff was great and really supportive. but. unless you ask. business center costs are also quite high -- nearly $1.40 per printed page. etc. Also. a hotel of this level should have free Wi-Fi rather than Wi-Fi that is dependent on joining a membership club.Finally. while the bar is excellent. the drinks are quite pricey  -- but. at the same time. worthwhile to try,Excellent business hotel
InterContinental Boston,Stephen,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,August 22  2017,6.3,Taxes added 14% to the listed rate for the hotel.

InterContinental Boston,Michael,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,August 3  2017,9.2,No free WiFi unless you joined their rewards club. in a hotel that charged $400+ a night is a pretty poor show. A charge to pay by Visa is also levied on top of state. local and convention centre taxes that add almost $70 dollars a night to the advertised cost,This hotel is well placed for most of the major attractions. the town centre and several tube stations
InterContinental Boston,David,United Kingdom,15 Reviews,August 1  2017,8.8,If we had not have been given the upgrade and freebies. I would have found the price we paid very expensive even relative to other hotels in the area - but thank you looking after us.,We were on our honeymoon and we were given a complimentary upgrade. To be honest. if we hadn't have been. I would've thought it very pricey for a smaller room. It was a very nice suite room with a view over the water with a nice ensuite with a bath and large shower. Breakfast wasn't included but the staff very kindly gave us complimentary breakfast. wifi and a later checkout at 2pm to help our celebration.

InterContinental Boston,View,United States of America,1 review,July 19  2017,9.2,It wasn't exactly kid friendly. I was happy that they offered kids food menu options. We booked the hotel partly because the description said "indoor pool." which there was an indoor pool but it was more for the adults not kids. It would have been nice if they had a section for kids.,Great location! Beautiful hotel.
InterContinental Boston,Daniel,United States of America,1 review,July 10  2017,10,Unlike lighting system that I didn't fully understand. The light by the door would go on about 7 or 8am. Though dim enough that it didn't bother me. next time I will plan to figure it out!  But there was nothin else I would say I didn't like. How could a city hotel be so great? Oh. I didn't try the street side of the hotel. but always ask for the water side. I don't know if the city side is loud. but water is certainly not.... though city side may have a great view of the city across the greenway... maybe not so bad after all.,It was easy to get to. If you fly to Logan and jump on e free silver line shuttle (free into the city). it is a 2-block walk from South Station. The place is very clean and very modern. The rooms were unique in many ways in that. you could open and shut a window from the bedroom to the bathroom. You had a shower and a tub. The desk overlooked a large window. If the weather is nice. they have a great patio on the water. It is also right next to where the Boston Tea Partt took place and many other attractions. The food was delicious there and plenty of restaurants like Nebo and Trade to try. The staff was very friendly and were great at starting conversations about the stay. I've stayed in many hotels in Boston and this was the experience that will bring me back.
InterContinental Boston,Gail,Canada,4 Reviews,July 4  2017,9.6,N/A,I thought the size of the rooms were spacious and comfortable and the views of the harbor and city were great.  I know the concierge Stephen was brilliant in helping to support my travel to the cape whilst in Boston

The food. the beverages. the building. the cleanliness. the staff. the comfortable beds and linens. the easy travel to all of Boston's wonderful culture. though costly was worth every bit of it.
InterContinental Boston,Derek,United States of America,8 Reviews,May 28  2017,9.6,N/A,The hotel was beautiful and in a great location for us. I was taking my daughter to the children's museum. only a short 5 minute walk from the hotel.  The room was clean and elegant. my daughter loved the separate tub and shower.
InterContinental Boston,Ainslie,New Zealand,3 Reviews,May 25  2017,7.5,We are not happy with BOOKING.COM     we paid for breakfast to be included but it turns out it was a la carte and we had $80 per day for breakfast per room      This did not roll over so if not spent or over spent too bad   - my husband had an earlier breakfast so I did not know how much I could spendThis was not explained to us comprehensively by the hotel or booking.comA city view room was half street view with building the other halfThe hotel could have provided free water bottles dailyThis hotel is for business/conference guests mainly We have been overcharged and waiting to hear back from the hotel,The staff were  friendly
InterContinental Boston,Susan,United States of America,1 review,May 8  2017,10,Parking expensive and wanted to charge $300 for incidentals - a little steep,Great location.  Once we parked we took T - which was very close to hotel.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.
InterContinental Boston,Jan,United States of America,1 review,May 5  2017,5.8,The phone beside the bed did not work and we reported it the first night but never fixed. It was hot in the room and never fixed. We reported it and someone came but it was still hot. The tub needs a step to get into it because it is high and hard to get into if you are shorter than 5'9".,The breakfast was excellent and most of the staff was nice except for one. The concierge was excellent and so helpful. His name was Marcus. They did take $50 off because of the problems but not enough at an expensive hotel.
InterContinental Boston,Carl,United States of America,1 review,April 21  2017,9.6,There was a sliding window between the bathroom and bed.when the bathroom light came on it woke my gf. also it led to privacy issues when you were using bathroom,The bathroom was excellent with a large glass shower and deep tub.
InterContinental Boston,Doris,United States of America,15 Reviews,April 20  2017,9.6,It would have been nice if the property offered an airport shuttle.  We had to find our own transportation and learned we overpaid after we booked it from home. but we did not want to have to hunt for it on arrival.  The spa on property did not advertise massage. which was a bit disappointing.,It was close to the harbor.  One of the stations for the Boston T was just two blocks away.  Many nice restaurants within walking distance.  The room was comfortable with easy to use temperature controls.  The coffee was kept stocked as we used it each day. including liquid half&amp;half.  The bathroom had separate shower stall and tub. which was wonderful for our runner to use to soak in after the marathon!
InterContinental Boston,Regine,United States of America,1 review,April 2  2017,10,Everything worked out well and I have no dislikes about this hotel.,Room service was great the staff are really nice and everything worked out the way I wanted it. The price of the hotel is great. Just keep in mind the deposit fee and the incidental fees when going and make sure you have a credit card  when checking in.
InterContinental Boston,Sonja,Serbia,4 Reviews,March 27  2017,10,Everything was great. Some loud guests at 2 am were chatting post wedding reception in the hallway and we could hear everything. Annoying.,The bed was really comfortable.  The open window from the bedroom into the bathroom/tub was neat.
InterContinental Boston,Benny,Canada,1 review,March 21  2017,9.6,I had to pay for Wi-Fi,Free wifiSo  I left one day early because of personal reasons wanted to check out before time and they didn't allow me to get reimbursed because it was done through booking.com  Instead of staying two days I only stayed one
InterContinental Boston,John,United States of America,1 review,March 17  2017,8.8,While we were out at dinner we had staff come in our room. When we came back to the hotel we were suprised to know that someone had been in our room uninvited.,N/A

InterContinental Boston,Jennifer,United States of America,1 review,February 19  2017,9.2,The mini fridge you can't store any of own drinks.

InterContinental Boston,Dragana,United States of America,4 Reviews,February 11  2017,7.1,We experienced some issues but stuff there didn't really feel any sense of emergency... so lots of days passed until problem was resolved. I was expecting we will be compensated somehow for all the inconvenience but that didn't happen either.,Location. location. location....
InterContinental Boston,Brad,United States of America,1 review,February 9  2017,9.6,The size of the pool. and the only way to access it was through the work out area. This could lead to wet foot prints which could lead to someone slipping.,The view of the harbor was amazing. The size of the living area was perfect. The sushi/tequila bar downstairs was exquisite. The quality of the late night room service was excellent as well as taste.
InterContinental Boston,Carol,United States of America,1 review,February 6  2017,9.6,N/A,The hotel staff were amazing!

InterContinental Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,January 30  2017,8.8,N/A,We liked the convenience of the hotel's restaurants and atmosphere of its bar. and also loved the local Italian restaurant. NEBO. just steps from the hotel.  The convenience and quality of the room service was fantastic (nice portions. too!).
InterContinental Boston,Helen,United States of America,1 review,January 30  2017,9.2,Hot water for bath and shower took over 5  minutes to reach room.   Hot water for shower lasted only a short time and only enough for one shower so that second shower became ice cold less that half way through.,Great room.  Great staff.  Layout  of room.  Free upgrade. Walking distance to the sites we wanted to enjoy   Late checkout.  Deep soaking tub
InterContinental Boston,Joseph,United States of America,3 Reviews,January 30  2017,10,When the lights for the bathroom were put on it lit up the whole room. The toilet water would begin to run randomly on a occasion.,Hotel was amazing. Tremendous value for the money.
InterContinental Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,January 17  2017,8.3,The pillows were horrible and when we asked for an upgrade we were placed in a room facing the fire station.,Service was prompt. everything we asked for. we recieved.
InterContinental Boston,Carol,United States of America,1 review,January 14  2017,9.2,The room still had garbage in trash can and some was in one of the side table drawers so staff need to do a better job of cleaning the room.,The place was beautiful. very friendly staff. Room was great Bed most comfortable I have ever slept in.
InterContinental Boston,Linda,United States of America,4 Reviews,January 3  2017,9.6,If I had any complaint. it would be breakfast on January 1. There were a few issues. Breakfast on Dec. 31st was wonderful.,The location was fantastic. We were able to walk to many of the activities that were going on in the city for First Night.
InterContinental Boston,Catherine,United States of America,1 review,January 2  2017,10,A cafe / coffee bar in lobby would be nice although there is a Starbucks and other cafes a short walk away,Wonderful waterfront location; staff on check-in friendly. efficient. helpful. Valet parking easy.  Also--really nice hotel gym. spa and pool are -lots of stuff and with natural lighting.
InterContinental Boston,Manju,Canada,4 Reviews,December 24  2016,6.7,Swimming pool didn't work the entire stay so kids disappointed. I didn't receive my newspaper in the mornings.,Staff were fantastic. very helpful especially Louis the concierge.Hotel is in great location. lovely to be on harbour side.
InterContinental Boston,Richard,United States of America,1 review,December 21  2016,5.0,"City view" has the fire station directly across the street. match that with the thin walls/windows and you will listen to sirens as if the window is wide open night and day.  There was a tray full of dirty dishes and breakfast food sitting in the hall next to our room from when we checked in Sunday and was still there on late Monday morning when we checked out. and we noticed many more on the way out.  I also did not like the surprise of $44 when I picked my vehicle up from the garage upon departure. The attendants approach you at the entrance and never mentioned a cost giving the impression it's part of your stay.,Comfy bed. staff at the rum bar were excellent and friendly.  The man that checked us in was personable and welcoming. Large television in the bedroom
InterContinental Boston,Nancy,United States of America,3 Reviews,December 20  2016,9.2,no breakfast on site except room service.  Water could have been hotter in the shower.,Bed was very comfortable;  pillows great;  Staff friendly and accommodating;   Shout out to Robert at front desk for going the extra mile for my birthday. and Brittany at concierge desk.
InterContinental Boston,Sandra,United States of America,2 Reviews,December 20  2016,8.8,My boyfriend went to break a $20 so we could leave a tip housekeeping. He went to the hostess who instead of stating. "Sorry. I don't have cash. but the front desk will be able to help you" just said "I don't have money." As someone in the customer service industry. the goal is to try and please the customer--or at least offer a solution. The only other thing that was odd was the ladies' locker room at the spa; shoes and towels were just left lying around. It looked messy. which was surprising.,front desk staff was super friendly. when they asked if we wanted a water view. we said yes. even though it was $50 more. When we got to the room. you could only see the river if you stood at the window and looked to the right. My boyfriend left a message when he went to access their wi-fi and the desk called and removed that portion of the bill. Really appreciated it. Spa services were nice as well.
InterContinental Boston,Erica,United States of America,1 review,December 10  2016,10,N/A,The property is lovely and location is great. We've stayed here many times and have always been very happy. The staff is happy to help in any way.
InterContinental Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,November 19  2016,5.5,Just to be clear-we stayed here to stay at a nice hotel in Boston. It was expensive but a nice hotel so we expected service. Nothing felt personal. Everything was "nice". Hated the check in attendant. But I would have saved a lot more money and just spent my days at a marriot or hyatt or hilton or something. Same amount of unpersonalized service. It didn't feel like a luxury hotel by any means. No mr. or mrs. our last name when we called down for things. There was just nothing special about this experience at all. Could have been replaced with any other no name hotel.,The room was clean. people said hello when we got there.
InterContinental Boston,John,United States of America,1 review,November 10  2016,9.2,I wish the hotel put even the smallest amount of effort into being child friendly. if you don't want kids in the restaurants. fine. how about something accommodating on the room service menu. The hotel is really the only hotel in the neighborhood with a pool and the neighborhood is prefect for kids. it would be so easy to better arm the staff with better information on the local kid attractions. have some suggestions on what to do when... it wasn't happening.  Now. the premium lounge was a huge hit with the kids. breakfast was awesome. cocktail food was something they craved. just the rest of the hotel was very adult. All said I would definitely go back.,our room overlooking the harbor was excellent! the premium level lounge was really excellent. food. beverage. surroundings all great. The lounge behind the bar was a great place to have a cocktail and snack with my wife along with my two seven year olds. the kids loved the music and it wasn't like taking the kids to a bar. The reason I booked here was they were the only hotel in the neighborhood near the aquarium and children's museum. with a room for four. and a pool I had to have a pool and the pool was great. Overall the staff was really nice and friendly.
InterContinental Boston,KieshaSmith,United States of America,4 Reviews,November 2  2016,7.1,I booked 3 nights via booking.com. I paid for 1 night in advance as part as the deal via booking.com. When I checked in. the hotel ran my card for 3 nights instead of 2. THIS HAD ME VERY ANNOYED. Which basically turned out to be. me paying for 4 nights up front with an additional hold of $150 per night for incidentals. Now I have to wait for the hotel to release the hold for the incidentals (which is fine) and the hold for the additional night I shouldn't have been charged for period.,The bathroom was lovely. Housekeeper was great.
InterContinental Boston,Mark,United Kingdom,9 Reviews,November 1  2016,8.3,The idea. at breakfast. of not doing the normal process of bringing the first course first and then the second course a bit later. rather than the somewhat disheartening concept of bringing everything at once... So fresh fruit had to be wolfed down before the eggs and bacon got stone cold,The breakfast buffet when it was available. which was Sunday
InterContinental Boston,Susan,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 31  2016,7.5,Not warmly greeted. the room set-up was odd - couch tucked into a dark alcove. the sliding window to the bathroom Adjacent to the bed.  Noise and light came right into sleeping area.  NO TOP SHEET!,Beautiful hotel. location.
InterContinental Boston,Michelle,United States of America,5 Reviews,October 27  2016,10,N/A,We where treat like celebrities. The concier Britney took care of us from the time we got there to the time we left she was awesome. I highly recommend this location in the Intercontinental I will be back

InterContinental Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,12 Reviews,October 4  2016,9.6,The door men are not really helpful. they were always "busy " for something(?) it took them more than 30 minutes to get my  luggage to my room. The lady who cleaned our room was very rude.,This is maybe my third time in a year I stayed in this hotel. The most of the staffs are very nice.
InterContinental Boston,Disappointing,Qatar,9 Reviews,September 21  2016,6.3,We requested a water or harbour view and on arrival there as none..would not stay there had I known as You soendo a lot of time in the room with young children....though the staff were friendly with my son. it is not a child-friendly hotel..hÃ¡s adult and business feel..champagne bar and club with loud mÃºsic on weekends..and French restaurant with adult menu..etc. Reception was too Busy and staff did not have time to care for customers. The room view was office buildings...a real bore for children and adults Who are room-bond during the evenings especially in rainy or bad weather etc.,Room Service meals were perfect for children and in-room dining. Adam the concierge as Very helpful. the porters were Very helpful with late checkout and bag Hold service was escure.
InterContinental Boston,Kate,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,September 19  2016,7.1,Not great value for money. Figured we'd stay here as a treat for the end of our road trip but were disappointed. Position was good. but having stayed in Holiday Inns (and equivalent) on route. not quite sure what the extra $150+ a night was for as there are similarly priced / spec hotels within the same area.,N/A
InterContinental Boston,Angela,United States of America,1 review,September 19  2016,9.6,Some rooms face the fire station so the sirens can be heard at all times of the day.,Loved the location and the ambience of the hotel. The hotel was clean and smelled great! The beds were very comfortable. the bonus of having a tub AND a shower was fantastic!We picked the hotel for its location: right on the Greenway and minutes from the Harbor Walk. It was a short walk for a three yr old to the Aquarium and the Rings Fountain. which is great because we didn't need to bring the stroller!
InterContinental Boston,Michael,Canada,5 Reviews,September 18  2016,8.3,staff could be a little more friendly and not so quick to say nothey are obviously trained to decline requests for extras...late check out. coffee trays for take out coffee in the club room. do someone else's job,N/A
InterContinental Boston,Fr_Ange,South Korea,3 Reviews,September 17  2016,3.3,I was overcharged by the hotel by the amount of $3292.08 and was reassured that I would get a full refund but it has been a week since my stay and I still have not received my refund in full. InterContinental hotel in Boston is the worst hotel I stayed at. they are just filled with frauds!,N/A
InterContinental Boston,Joanne,United States of America,1 review,September 6  2016,8.3,So here is the problem: there is a sliding window between the bathroom and the rest of the room. When it is open you can see out of the window.  When it is closed (or open). EVERY odor made in the bathroom comes out and wafts over the head and nose of the person in the bed.  What were they thinking? Who knows. but not everyone travels alone.  After this last visit. this design is a deal breaker for me.  I was the one in the bed...,The room was generally comfortable and the staff was beyond compare.
InterContinental Boston,Debra,United States of America,1 review,September 2  2016,10,Minibar was very expensive.  Would have liked room in refrigerator for personal food and drinks.,Bed was very comfortable. lighting versatile and the soaking tub very relaxing. Loved the deck on the water. First class all the way.

112 Myrtle St #7 by Lyon Apartments,Anonymous,Abkhazia, ​ Georgia,2 Reviews,October 9  2017,5.0,The very steep stairs to the 3rd floor were a challenge.I called Mario the 2nd day to let him know that the Keurig did not work &amp; there were 2 lights out. He assured me someone would take care of both problems that afternoon. Never heard from him and no one ever came to address the problems. An Apartment should have the ability to make coffee.,Excellent location in historical Beacon Hill. Ease of getting to T stop and the many shops near by. Beautiful roof top view of Boston and the Charles River
112 Myrtle St #7 by Lyon Apartments,Jj,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 7  2017,8.3,Mattresses need to be replaced in one bedroom - big depressin in the middle. kind of like sleeping on a hill; blackout drapes in the bedrooms would be a big plus.

112 Myrtle St #7 by Lyon Apartments,Yanhao,China,4 Reviews,July 4  2017,9.6,For elder people. they may be trouble with the stairs. which are a little steep. And room service is charged. During our stay. the myrytle st was under construction. it was noisy in daytime.,This apartment located in downtown(just a little distance to MGH redline. and Boston Common greenline. and maybe there is an orange line station around). is really convenient for tourism in Bos. It.provides a set of cookware which helps family to cook inside. Feel Nice.

112 Myrtle St #7 by Lyon Apartments,Abbie,United States of America,1 review,April 5  2017,10,N/A,This place was excellent. I am recommending to my friends to stay here when they are in town. The home is equipped with proper kitchen essentials such as 4qt pot. a medium size skillet. a medium size pan. a knife and spatula set. There are complimentary snacks and bathroom soaps. Beds are super comfy. not hostel style mattresses that you may encounter at other AirBnBs. The location of the apartment is right in the center of Beacon Hills. so the windows overlook historic brownstones. Great place for a great price!

The Bostonian Boston,Barry,United Kingdom,1 review,October 25  2017,9.2,Nothing as regards the accommodation and staff.,Great location for touring the city. Well proportioned  and very comfortable room. Arrived very early in the morning and therefore had booked the room from the day before. On arrival advised no room was available due to number of bookings and some maintenance problem. Extremely unhappy as had been flying overnight. Provided with free breakfast when restaurant opened and reimbursed one nights accommodation fee. Reception staff were very apologetic and ensured we were provided the first available room although that did not become available to mid morning. However despite the initial difficulties we enjoyed our stay at this hotel.
The Bostonian Boston,Trudy Edwards,United States of America,10 Reviews,October 25  2017,9.6,I wish it wasn't so expensive but then Boston hotels are all expensive.,We always stay at the Bostonian when in Boston.

We were across the street from Qunicey Hall which was loud in the evening but quieted down by bed time.  Desk was very helpful.  No ice machine available but room service always delivered within 10 minutes.  Apples at front desk were a nice touch as a snack for the day of walking.  Within easy walking distance of multiple subway stops.
The Bostonian Boston,Anonymous,Canada,1 review,August 22  2017,9.2,everything was great.,the location of the property is perfect. my husband and I walked everywhere from the property. walk to Newberry was the longest and that was only 40 minutes. the staff are awesome so friendly. we have travelled a lot and enjoy the smaller places for the more personal feel. request a mini fridge for the room and it was there when we checked in. We arrived early so we expected to leave our bags until check in. surprised room was ready for us. we did not use the restaurant as we explored other areas of Boston. market across the street was perfect for shopping. picking up a quick snack and fruits.
The Bostonian Boston,Dale,United States of America,1 review,August 18  2017,8.8,The bathrobes were decent. but not what I expect in this level hotel. They were small and not very plush. The Omni Nashville I stayed in the week before sets the standard.,Fantastic shower. bed was terrific and the "balcony" was a nice feature.
The Bostonian Boston,Joan,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 14  2017,7.1,No extra toilette paper in bathroom. lobby was not impressive. TV did not work. no refrigerator. pricey snacks and water galore. does anyone want them?  No ice machine had to use room service.  The property is mediocre ..certainly not the high end it pretends to be.,location
The Bostonian Boston,Rae-lynn,Canada,3 Reviews,August 8  2017,9.6,There left hand side elevator would often not go up.,The location was PERFECT for seeing the sights of Boston.  The concierge was amazing in giving recommendations for us and they even accommodated a late checkout.
The Bostonian Boston,Susan,United States of America,1 review,August 8  2017,9.6,N/A,We loved our getaway to Boston!  The Bostonian was lovely and very convenient to Faneuil Hall and a brisk walk to and from the Theatre District.  The staff was very polite and helped us whenever asked.  We chuckled at our "balcony" as both of us could not fit out on it at the same time!
The Bostonian Boston,Two,United States of America,1 review,August 2  2017,9.2,Very expensive - but it's high season and everything seems to be expensive in the summer. especially this area.,Location superb - close to harbor. North End. Quincy Market. historic sites. Next to parking garage and metro. Hotel staff very friendly - because our room was not available. we were generously upgraded to an enormous suite.
The Bostonian Boston,David,United Kingdom,15 Reviews,August 1  2017,8.8,Had to pay for breakfast (common in Boston). No bath.,We had a bottle of bubbly with some strawberries complimentary since we were on our honeymoon. The breakfast the following morning outside was also beautiful. A very kind and unexpected gesture. Great location with a beautiful little balcony to stand on and check our the nice evening atmosphere or morning sun.
The Bostonian Boston,HOD,Germany,22 Reviews,July 30  2017,9.2,Gym should be in better condition.,Location. location. location! Wonderful and luxury hotel direct in opposite of Faneuil Hall and Boston Market Hall. Subway station only 1 block away. We did everything by foot and subway. Hotel staff very attentive and helpful. Room (deluxe room) very spacious with separate dressing room area. Good mattress. Unfortunately a bit noisy due to outside ventilation installation hence no possibility to open window at night. Overall very good hotel that we woild definitel recommend to others.
The Bostonian Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 26  2017,10,N/A,Each of the staff members I encountered were friendly and very helpful.  The hotel loby and facilities are first class.  I was impressed with the size of the room and the quality of the decor.  Location can;t be beat as I just walked across the street to Faneuil Hall and it was a quick walk to eat Italian food in the North End. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!
The Bostonian Boston,Laura,United States of America,4 Reviews,July 24  2017,9.2,Wish there had been a mini-fridge for personal items.  Fridge in the room was fully stocked with no room to store anything else.  A sensor will detect anything moved or removed from the fridge.,Great location! We walked to all the Freedom Trail sites we wanted to see.  Also close to the subway which we used to visit Lexington and Concord (final connection to Lexington is a bus) as well as Harvard.  Close to the Long Wharf where we took a round-trip ferry to Salem.
The Bostonian Boston,Emmanuel,Philippines,30 Reviews,July 22  2017,7.5,When I checked in a bit past midnight (having previously advised a midnight arrival). the desk clerk. Juan. didn't seem ready. and hunted around for several minutes before deciding what room to give me.,The room is a bit old. and is overpriced when the rate is hiked to $500 due to high occupancy. However. the location can't be beat.
The Bostonian Boston,Morgan,United States of America,1 review,July 17  2017,9.6,N/A,The room was a bit small (we were traveling with an active toddler - would have been plenty big for just us. but was a little tight with her running around in there). but the room was still very nice and the bed was very comfortable.  Great view of Quincy Market from our room.  Bathroom was very large and very clean.  All the staff we interacted with were super nice and helpful.
The Bostonian Boston,Abby,United Kingdom,1 review,July 17  2017,7.5,A small sample pack of toothpaste cost us $4. usually good quality hotels provide it for free.,Nice modern hotel with friendly stuff. Very clean and bright.
The Bostonian Boston,Kaveh,United States of America,1 review,July 15  2017,7.1,Weird pricing. Not based on the day of the week. the season or holiday but by occupancy. I feel the advertised price is only a come on. My rate increased $125 by second nigh and another $16 by the next. For example. I had a quoted rate of $255.20 and I ended up paying $1598.65 for 4 night stay (this included the taxes).,It is located next to Faneuil Hall. Quincy Market. Hard Rock Cafe and near North Boston (little Italy).
The Bostonian Boston,Kat,United States of America,1 review,July 14  2017,10,Bed isn't exactly top hotel quality...it was fine nothing g awful just not what I expect when you go to a nicer hotel.,So convenient to everything! Valet parking attendance was suoerb. always helpful with places to eat etc...the bar/restaurant on site is a go to for visitors and locals..great breakfast...great drinks...amazing lobster dinner for 20 bucks! All in all just a wonderful visit.
The Bostonian Boston,Shirley,United States of America,1 review,July 11  2017,8.3,The main room with beds was very dark.  There were only two lamps in the room.  One on the desk and the other on a table between the two beds.  There was no night stand or lamp at the side of either bed. so the person sleeping on the outside could not see to read &amp; had no table to use.The safe was so high that I could not read the instructions or see inside!  The bath area had two doors.  The inside door closest to the vanity &amp; toilet area was broken.  It was almost impossible to close.  Also. the lighting in the vanity area was not sufficient for a women to put on makeup..We paid on average. $400.00 per night in this 4 star hotel &amp; do not feel that we got our money's worth.  I would caution someone about staying here.,Excellent location in the heart of the city.  The beds were very comfortable &amp; the room size was adequate for three adults.  The lighting in the bathroom vanity area was excellent and the shower worked well.
The Bostonian Boston,Bob,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 11  2017,9.2,I did not like that there was not an airport shuttle.  The staff did get us a taxi quickly but plan on an additional $30 for the taxi.,The staff was very helpful.  The location could not be beat.  It is right in the heart of everything.
The Bostonian Boston,Michael,United States of America,1 review,July 9  2017,9.2,Got woken up at 6 AM by street vendor forklifts and trucks setting up farmers market outside. Possibly only a Saturday issue but not sure since we only stayed there one day. Not all rooms faced this street so just be clear when getting room assignment.,The location couldn't be better for Quincy Market and harbor activities!
The Bostonian Boston,Jennifer,United States of America,1 review,July 9  2017,9.6,Nothing.,They allowed us to check in early because they had a room available.  We had an amazing view of Quincy Market from our balcony.  We will be back.
The Bostonian Boston,Jane,Australia,10 Reviews,July 9  2017,9.2,I could hear the neighbours television through the walls and that was a shame.  Had to call the desk when television was still going strong and loud after midnight to ask them to get them to turn it down.  Also didn't like the overuse of plastics - there is a coffee and tea pod machine which means if want coffee or tea. need to go out and get it or contribute coffee/tea pods.,Loved the view out the window and the location - can't imagine you could find better. Staff were lovely and friendly and helpful at all times.
The Bostonian Boston,Traveling,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 7  2017,10,AC didn't work in first room. but staff responded promptly and we were in a new room in 20 mins.Parking was a little expensive for our taste.,Location was perfect.  Clean room. Directly across the street from Quincy Market and Faneuil Hall.  Short walk to North End restaurants.  Close to many Freedom Trail stops.  Great view of city. Small step out balcony was quaint and cute!
The Bostonian Boston,Sergey,United States of America,1 review,July 4  2017,6.7,Room was quite noisy (from some ventilation or engine of sorts) even though it was a more expensive studio suite. Front desk seems a bit understaffed.,Excellent location and clean rooms.
The Bostonian Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 3  2017,8.8,We could not open balcony doors because hanging over farmers market for 2 days. The garbage and rotten vegetable smell was disgusting  and the early morning yelling was very annoying. When you pay this high price for a room with a balcony we expect to use the balcony.,Large  room.. great location
The Bostonian Boston,Mark,New Zealand,4 Reviews,July 1  2017,9.2,N/A,Staff were very hospitable. friendly. knowledgeable and fun to seal with.The hotel is excellently located with easy access to the heart of most of the action in Boston.
The Bostonian Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,June 28  2017,9.2,The description stated a balcony view. We had a view of the roof of the back of the building.,The room was very spacious. larger than expected. Great location and very central to everything we wanted to do while in Boston.
The Bostonian Boston,Jeanette,United States of America,1 review,June 20  2017,6.3,It was way over priced. the rooms were nothing special for the amount of many I paid. the beds were small. They only have full size beds. There's a vendor market every Friday and Saturday that wraps around the building which was totally unexpected. I was shock when I pulled up to the hotel because there was garbage everywhere. It wasn't a very good first impression. We had to request a different room (which they accommodated us the best they could) because the first one was very small and had the view of a parking lot and the vendor market and it's garbage. The second room was better but the bathroom door was broken which they fixed as soon as we informed them. I also didn't like the fact that they charge $49.00 a night to valet park the car. The website doesn't give you that information so that was a surprise. I now know where things are located so next time I will be staying in a hotel that's just as nice in the area. but half the price....,The location was great and the staff was very nice. It was my husbands birthday so they sent a small cake to the room. mostly because we were unhappy with our room. But the gesture was nice. The restaurant had great food. dollar oysters that were amazing and a $20.00 Lobster meal that came with soup. corn. and a potato. I also liked the Valet parking only because the car was ready when I wanted to go somewhere. I called 30 minutes prior to leaving and when I got outside the car was there. They open all the doors for you and where very polite.
The Bostonian Boston,Jeffrey,United States of America,1 review,June 15  2017,7.5,For the price point of this hotel. trying to milk every dollar for a bottle of water or a can of soda or a bag of chips. etc. in your room is quite ridiculous. Five-star service would include all these things. And these are five star prices,Access to Quincy Market and North End by foot.
The Bostonian Boston,Michael,United States of America,1 review,June 13  2017,10,After our first night's stay. it was nearly 3:00 pm before the cleaning staff came to our room.,We arrived prior to check-in time. and we were able to get in our room early.The view from our room was wonderful!
The Bostonian Boston,Aleksander,United Kingdom,11 Reviews,June 7  2017,8.8,Street noise. however never past 11pm so it was fine. The window could have been slightly better insulated to deal with that.,Room was decent for the price and had an awesome view. Staff were helpful and nice. Downtown Boston on your doorstep.
The Bostonian Boston,Tammy,United States of America,1 review,June 6  2017,10,Nothing,The staff was on spot. the room was well kept by housekeeping. the in-house restaurant was very good. The location was in easy walking distance to restaurants. shopping and transportation.
The Bostonian Boston,Ana,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 6  2017,5.0,First night of our anniversary trip. they gave us the 2nd floor overlooking the city (Not romantic at all with college kids yelling and running around all night) but the WORST part was the street vendors that began at 1/4 to 5am to unload and organize. I understand everyone needs to work. I also understand that we paid over $350 for a "romantic anniversary getaway"  to a historical city not to hear yelling. screaming.college kids running up and diem the hallways drunk and those wonderful. noisy fruit vendors right under my balcony. Ugh,First night of our anniversary
The Bostonian Boston,Bostonian,United States of America,4 Reviews,May 31  2017,10,No problems,Exceptional location by Faneuil Market. North End ( Little Italy). Freedom Trail (North Church) and the old quarter with the Union Oyster House.In house restaurant is very good. Hotel decor is new. clean and modern; just like the spacious room.
The Bostonian Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,4 Reviews,May 23  2017,10,Not the hotels fault but because the location is very central to the action it can be noisy at night outside the hotel with car horns. sirens. and people. Worse at weekends. We did not hear noise between rooms. only from the outdoors.,Very friendly staff. Lobby is great place to hang out or meet your group. When you arrive by car you can pull in off the street which is much better than being crowded at curbside.
The Bostonian Boston,Sherry,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 23  2017,8.8,I think that  the price for a diet coke . in our refrigerator was ridiculous!!!Also. I do not like that we can not store our "MIKES Pastries" anywhere in the room to enjoy throughout our stay!  You need to have a refrigerator for us to keep things in!,excellent location!Very convenient to our venues for graduationsVery courteous front door staff!!!
The Bostonian Boston,Jamie,United States of America,1 review,May 22  2017,7.1,The room was not clean.  For the price I expect the room to be spotless.  There were no garbage bags in the garbage pails.   There was dust around the fire place and in the daylight you could see the dressers needed to be wiped down in the front.  I could not put anything in the fridge. (light snacks. refreshments I travel with) as it has those specialized canned shelves to monitor what you take out to drink so you can be charged.  An empty shelf would be useful to refrigerate restaurant leftovers.,The bed was comfortable.  The balcony was lovely.
The Bostonian Boston,Madeleine,Kenya,16 Reviews,May 22  2017,9.6,Room had no view because it had just a high window which you could not see out of. I did ask for a quiet room so I'm OK with that but I was right next to the gym so that door opened and closed a lot. Blinds on the window. no curtains.,Great bed and bathroom! Really good location in centre of all the action- shops. near the sea. good restaurants.
The Bostonian Boston,Ghazi,Saudi Arabia,9 Reviews,May 22  2017,7.1,The reception staff needs more professional training on how to treat customers.Expensive car valet parking and you have no other choice!,Excellent room cleaning services.
The Bostonian Boston,Merryn,Australia,2 Reviews,May 21  2017,7.5,We loved the hotel itself. but on a negative note. we asked for a recommendation for dinner and we were advised to go to Oceania (I think! A name like that!). It was very expensive with average food and poor service! We felt that this was suggested because the hotel may have got kick-backs!,I loved the fact that we had space in our room. it was well appointed and we appreciated the fresh fruit bowl at reception.
The Bostonian Boston,Mark,Australia,4 Reviews,May 19  2017,8.8,N/A,Great location for a holiday.  Across the road from Faneuil Hall.  All the restaurants. bars. cafes and tourist attractions are within an easy walk.Very friendly and accommodating staff and every few days they have free drinks and nibblies which allows you to meet other guests.
The Bostonian Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 9  2017,10,N/A,Can't beat this location! Easy walk to T &amp; attractions. Easy drive. Super friendly staff. Coffee in morning and afternoon snack were great! Had a blast with my  9 &amp; 7 year olds. Would definitely stay here again.
The Bostonian Boston,Anonymous,Canada,1 review,May 2  2017,9.6,Website - very difficult to get information about this locationTrying to contact hotel prior to arrival was difficult.  Had to leave messages. long wait for return calls,Location. hotel bar. not a huge property. helpful doormen and conciergeWalking distance to most sites
The Bostonian Boston,Thomas,United States of America,1 review,April 27  2017,10,N/A,The accommodations and location were excellent for what we had planned for our visit.  We also enjoyed the public space such as the lobby for some coffee during down-time.  We would definatley stay here again!
The Bostonian Boston,Eva,United States of America,11 Reviews,April 24  2017,6.7,The decor is very outdated. The colors are way too dark. there is carpeting everywhere. the bathroom colors are dark too. with a rich orange paint. wood that looks like cherry wood etc. Hard to tell also how clean when you get so much pattern and lack of light colors.  Also. the fridge was packed with drinks and you could NOT take them out (it is one of those that will charge you if you remove anything). NOT good. especially when you travel with kids who may need milk at night or yogurt for breakfast or whatnot.  This was the only hotel on this trip that did not let us use the fridge.  The parking was also way too expensive at $50 for the night.,The location is very good if you are looking for proximity to the historic sites and the North End. The hotel has the necessary basics (we did get free wifi) and the lobby is updated (although not my style). I can see they are trying to update here and there in the rooms too - the faucets and fixtures in the bathroom were new - and that was good. Room sufficiently big. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable.
The Bostonian Boston,Rebecca,Australia,1 review,April 24  2017,9.2,Breakfast is at the attached cafe. I had eggs benedict on English muffins. It was a pretty ordinary dish and the bread was really soggy and unedible.  The hollandaise sauce wasn't nice either.  This is the only negative thing about the hotel.  Next time I would eat breakfast elsewhere.,Awesome location in downtown Boston. Friendly staff. Super friendly parking/front door staff. The room was a great size. nice and clean and very modern.  Very comfortable bed. I would definitely stay here again.
The Bostonian Boston,Angela,United States of America,1 review,April 22  2017,9.2,N/A,Spacious room and liked the extra touches - there was a cheese and wine reception in the lobby when we arrived. fresh fruit and coffee served in the morning.  Luggage facilities and late check out facility. Very central and across the street from Quincy Market.  Minutes to the T
The Bostonian Boston,Jennifer,United States of America,1 review,April 22  2017,7.9,Refer to above,Visiting son in college.Room excellent. Breakfast was not served as ordered. Miss communication about breakfast being included between booking site and hotel.
The Bostonian Boston,Eleonor,Switzerland,9 Reviews,April 20  2017,7.1,Strong noise of aeration. balcony a bit too small. room a bit dark. close to traffic,The cosy feeling of the lobby. the friendly &amp; hepful staff. the coffee/tea machines in the room. nice modern bathroom. comfortable and big bed.
The Bostonian Boston,William,United States of America,1 review,April 19  2017,7.9,Would like the hotel to leave some room for me in the fridge. More coffee in the room. A little pricey for what you get.,Loved the veranda on the 7th floor. Hotel location excellent. Bed very comfy. Outdoor staff very helpful with directions.
The Bostonian Boston,Bernadette,Aruba,1 review,April 19  2017,9.6,That paying with my Debit card was not possible. We are a Dutch territory and Credit Cards are not usually something that is always used.,I liked the property walking distance to most places and the service was great and it was clean.
The Bostonian Boston,Laron,United States of America,1 review,April 19  2017,10,Loved everything.,The food was amazing. The staff was friendly and very knowledgeable about the neighborhood. The bed was super comfortable and the room was amazing. Great views and Great amenities at the hotel. I will be returning.
The Bostonian Boston,Dawn,United States of America,4 Reviews,April 18  2017,7.1,Confusion over breakfast coupons I thought were included on Booking.com weren't there upon checking in. Amazing amount of noise from balcony doors. water leaking from roof into room and puddling in carpet by tv. Water heater burst so no hot water on first day.,Great view. near shopping. Cheers bar very close by. Room had maintenance issue and front desk comped us lunch for the trouble. Maintenance person was fabulous and she seemed very competent.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Theresa,United States of America,1 review,October 29  2017,10,N/A,I brought my grandsons (4 and 6). I found the hotel very kid friendly.  Not pretentious at all.  Very easy vibe.

Aloft Boston Seaport,Anonymous,United States of America,6 Reviews,October 24  2017,5.4,Terrible and expensive breakfast. Very noisy and poorly functioning air conditioner....itâ€™s like one youâ€™d find at a budget roadside motel.,Location....proximity to the conference center
Aloft Boston Seaport,Melissa,United States of America,8 Reviews,October 23  2017,10,That I had to leave so early to catch my flight.  I wouldâ€™ve loved to have stayed for breakfast.,Very new and clean.  Comfortable bed with big TV.  Easy parking and easy access to the airport.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Gary,United States of America,7 Reviews,October 15  2017,8.3,The air conditioning is not good at all.,Marvelous shower. Large room. Terrific beds. Really wonderful. except the air conditioning is not acceptable at all.
Aloft Boston Seaport,David,United States of America,1 review,October 9  2017,5.4,Not at all worth the money.  Subpar hotel at premium price.  On fringe of industrial area.  One bottle of 'complementary' water (for a room with 2 guests).  2 bath towels.  Shower leaked onto bathroom floor.  View of roof.  Was told parking was $25. and we were charged $42.,It was serviceable.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Teressa,United States of America,1 review,October 2  2017,6.3,We were told our parking was validated because the lot for hotel parking is $25 per day. We brought our parking ticket in front desk printed us out a bar code to scan to get on and out of the lot without paying. When i went to check out I was charged  $75 for parking and was told oh its not free however their website states stay with us through March 2018 and parking is free and i read over terms in conditions and no where does it state you will be charged $75 at check put. Very disappointed. I also think you should offer a free breakfast!,The staff was friendly and helpful
Aloft Boston Seaport,Rae,United States of America,1 review,October 2  2017,9.2,I didnâ€™t like the fact we had to pay $25 in parking when I had already paid over $300 to stay for one night. Iâ€™m not sure why my stay was so expensive when all these other reviews and such they didnâ€™t spend nearly that much. I just feel with that price. parking shouldâ€™ve been free especially for staying one night. Also - a better breakfast option too.,The bed was absolutely amazing - we all slept like angels! I loved the overall view we had too. Felt like we were in the sky. but once it was time to sleep the curtains blocked out all night which is what we needed.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Andrew,United Kingdom,29 Reviews,September 30  2017,8.8,N/A,Great view. Hubway (bicycle rental) station right across the street which is an excellent way to travel into the city. And directly opposite the Lawn on D for some evening entertainment.

Aloft Boston Seaport,Denise,United States of America,1 review,September 29  2017,10,How to order food was very confusing because you couldn't tell there was a chef behind the wall.,The beds were so comfortable &amp; the hotel is beautiful &amp; clean. Our maid Evelyn was the best! We just loved her!
Aloft Boston Seaport,Rachel,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 21  2017,10,N/A,This hotel was amazing! We are definitely going to stay at an Aloft again! The staff were above and beyond friendly and helpful. the hotel was clean and roomy. and the layout/ decorations were so unbelievably cool. Very much a high end. contemporary hotel. I definitely recommend!
Aloft Boston Seaport,Tesha,United States of America,8 Reviews,September 19  2017,9.2,The view was not great but it was in the city's business area so not sure if the hotel itself could change that.,The property was beautiful. modern and my boyfriend and I enjoyed the entire stay.  The room was a great size. for the two of us. although the view was disappointing.  The Staff was friendly. accommodating and eager to make our stay memorable and enjoyable.  I would definitely like to return to this hotel.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Kimberly,United States of America,1 review,September 14  2017,7.1,I booked months prior with 4 guests. Upon arrival they had a hard time finding a room asked if we'd share a king bed. When a room with 2 beds was fouND another employee confronted the employee helping us saying she promised our room to someone else.another friend that night got a room with someone still in the room..very unorganized,The modern look of the rooms
Aloft Boston Seaport,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 13  2017,10,Parking  $25 a day. not cool.I did pay for a room. are at the restaurant drank at the bar.That's what there for. So why can't parking be free or at least less than  $25.,The hotel is great I like that it has a bar/club atmosphere on one side and a bar/restaurant one the other.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Robert,Thailand,59 Reviews,September 7  2017,7.9,For a new hotel the AC is far too loud. Hotel can be noisy depending on the active departure runway from Boston. But if you run the AC you wont hear the airplanes!,Modern hotel. Good location in South Boston. Easy walk to the waterfront. Short ride to airport. Friendly welcome. Rooms are not large but are comfortable. Public areas - bar/lounge are welcoming.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Reluctantskiiers,United Kingdom,10 Reviews,September 5  2017,7.9,location. terrible views . hotel in middle of a industrial area. swimming pool is very small indeed.  Description on internet does not accurately reflect the location. It is described as having a sea view this is misleading . Also the "green" is in fact an entertainment event not a grassed area as we imagined. There were two evening events on during our 5 day stay. to be fair the noise ended at 10.30 ish. Breakfast is unusual event and served on plastic plates. Quite a wide choice . I am not keen on piped music.,The staff. clean room. comfortable bed. The staff went out of their way to make our trip special. Lovely helpful staff. Nice white bedding and towels. Would be an ideal place for people visiting the conference centre facing. Teenagers love this hotel. Wide range of breakfast items. Comfortable seating in reception. All areas always very clean. bedding changed during our 5 day stay. towels everyday. Easy to get from airport as a free bus drops you at the end of the road. Easy to find. It felt safe walking around at night.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 4  2017,10,N/A,The staff was very friendly. When the system went down. there was a big line of people trying to check in so they offered us a $10 gift card to spend at breakfast.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Kristin,Norway,6 Reviews,September 4  2017,9.2,N/A,Stylish hotel. comfy beds. The view from the room was the entire Boston skyline and even a peek of the ocean. I went for a bachelorette party and the staff sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne!
Aloft Boston Seaport,Lisa,United States of America,1 review,September 3  2017,6.7,Parking - why do you have toPay for parking ? 25.00 a night is a bit much !Also the kitchen for breakfast should have someone helping . The gentlemen who takes your order at the window also cooks it(microwaves it) and serves .Also consider a shuttle service to drive downtown Boston.,Staff was friendly .
Aloft Boston Seaport,Mominme,United States of America,1 review,September 3  2017,9.2,We did not appreciate the loud music that played at 10 in the central area of the hotel where the main desk is located. They have a bar that serves a variety of food and a cafe in this area. The poor staff had to answer phones and assist people with that volume of sound seemed counterintuitive. but the staff did so with a smile and humor. As a family destination. this would not be a pool I could recommend. It was small once 3 families were in it and the lining scratched both our kiddos feet. We still enjoyed it. but I can't say the cost merited the pool for a family. On a final family information note. they only had a few channels our children(8-10) were interested in; Disney. Discovery and PBS. They hoped for a little more variety.,The beds were really comfortable though the pillows were a little too downy for our preference. The room was very clean and we really appreciated the use of a mini fridge. We liked the 2 complimentary coffees/tea and voucher if we didn't use the turn down service which we then used for more coffee in the downstairs cafe. We appreciated the pool being open until 11pm. The staff was very helpful. As we did a lot of walking to our destinations. we appreciated the few breakfast and dinner options that were close enough by.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Lee,Singapore,1 review,September 3  2017,5.8,Shoddy Housekeeping service - staff removed used bath towels without replacing themFront desk - was put on hold for more than 20 minutes when I called to confirm a late checkout,Comfortable beddings
Aloft Boston Seaport,Aideen,Ireland,3 Reviews,September 1  2017,10,Nothing really......,Rooms. Pool. Bar area. staff. fitness centre. location.   A great place to stay and very modern!Lawn on D across the street is perfect. breakfast is good.   Free games are fun.Staff superb!
Aloft Boston Seaport,Marissa,Netherlands,14 Reviews,August 30  2017,9.2,The airconditioner was quite oiud when you turned it on at night.,Trendy and clean hotel. The staff were friendly and our room was nice and big and the bed comfy. When we arrived back from a day out the lobby was lively and we could enjoy a deibk in the loft-like bar while other people played pool and just hung out. The location is a bit out of the way for Downtown Boston and we had to get a taxi to the main attractions. But still the neighbourhood is clean and safe with ample parking if you have a car.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Nadia,Canada,1 review,August 29  2017,7.9,There were very loud guests in our hallway at 2 am (out of the hotel's control. I know. but still bothersome). Also the hotel was a bit far from the main attractions. easily walkable but when you've only gotten one day in Boston and want to do touristy things. maybe not the best option. Our feet were a bit achy!,Hotel is super close to the cruise terminal - we basically walked from the terminal to the hotel. The gentleman that greeted us at the front desk when we arrived was super helpful. He let us have our room early (we arrived at 9am. check-in was at 3!). He gave us great tips on where to eat. what to visit and what to do. Also. the elevator was super cool.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Anonymous,United States of America,5 Reviews,August 25  2017,7.5,There is a band that plays at maximum volume every Wednesday ( or is the Thursday?). My floor level was immediately above the band. and I could not sleep until they stopped at midnight. This was not good for my meeting presentation. But this would be a good place for young lively people. Another thing. I also booked a room for a colleague. I did not go to see it. but they said the layout of the closet was weird. And they were shocked at the expensive price.,I got a good hotel room. I had a great view of the lawn and the parties on it. It was the cheapest and closest location to the Westin Hotel (where the meeting was taking place). This is a very expensive hotel. but compared to other Boston prices. this was the cheapest.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Denise,United States of America,1 review,August 23  2017,7.5,I opted for the "go green" stay in which I thought I was just opting out of have my towels and sheets exchanged. but apparently it when you choose that. housekeeping doesn't clean or make your bed at all so that was a little weird. Other than that. it was an enjoyable stay for business.,All of the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The Lawn on D across the street was such a cool venue to walk over and hang out at. especially since the weather was so perfect during my stay. The food and drinks at the restaurant downstairs were great and the waitstaff were excellent.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Dorothy,United States of America,4 Reviews,August 21  2017,8.3,Having to pay so much to park. or even pay at all.  Music TOO loud in the lobby.  Had a difficult time hearing the staff over it.  No place to eat except sandwich place. DD. in walking distance.  Even though I booked one king bed. got a handicapped room with 2 beds. Difficult to shower standing up.  A/C unit very loud!  Pain to keep adjusting the thermostat. and volume on TV to compensate to hear.,CLEAN!! Bed very comfy.  Interesting that the elevators don't have floor buttons. but on the outside you tell it what floor to go to. rather than up or down.  Fairly close walking distance to attend a function at the Westin. LOVED Barney at the front desk!!  Very helpful with parking issue. and getting pizza at 2 am!  Rest of staff can learn from him. The bottled water in the room was complimentary!!  Bliss products to use in the shower. a big plus!!  Would stay here again.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Lhd9296,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 18  2017,9.2,N/A,Location to South Boston (where daughters live); near fun Playground on D site. convenient to Broadway T-stop; the hotel held our luggage on check out day until we had to go to airport.  Would stay again when visiting Boston.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Jarrod,Australia,8 Reviews,August 17  2017,7.9,Advertised on Booking.com as having a bath when it didn't. Price seems fair for Boston. which in itself is offensively high.,Nice view. comfy bed and impressive shower. Really happy with the gym too!
Aloft Boston Seaport,Patricia,United States of America,1 review,August 15  2017,7.1,I would like to have had say a complimentary breakfast offered. and the bed was slightly lumpy. These are probably the only dislikes!,The location was great. right across the street from the Convention Center.
Aloft Boston Seaport,David,United States of America,1 review,August 15  2017,10,Nothing to comment on.,Great location.  Convenient to South Station and the Cruise Terminal.  Restaurant had a nice selection and the service was great.  We definitely would book this hotel again.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Jim,United States of America,1 review,August 14  2017,7.9,No Microwave in room. Coffee maker is a one cup maker. not a Keurig or pot maker. Shower had a fetish window into the sleeping area. very creepy. Had a room good for 4 people. two queen beds. but the room is so small you must be very close to not be awkward. better if you want two people with large beds. No area to do anything in room. no dressers for clothes. no drawers for items. Had to go down to the bar/lounge to do activities/games with friends. Offers 24/7 sandwiches but it's actually just a few sandwiches when breakfast ends. till they get sold out of the cooler usually by 1-2pm. breakfast ending between 10-11am depending on the day. Coffee is overly strong which is good if you like that. but no blonde roast for the rest of us. The view said ocean view. but it's really just an industrial sea dock. Pillows have no substance to them providing no head support. good for some people not so good for others such as myself. Drinks/snacks are overly priced. luckily you can hit up a few nearby CVS type marts. Parking is 25 a day and you have to get in/out privileges from hotel and it only takes a credit card for payment.,The most advanced elevators I've ever seen. Very clean establishment. Friendly staff. easy to talk to. Very nice walk in shower with shampoo/conditioner and body wash dispensers. Food from the bar was very good. specifically had the BBQ chicken flatbread. It's 100 feet to the exhibition center from the front door of the hotel.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Emily,United States of America,1 review,August 6  2017,7.1,I didn't like the fact that you could see into the shower from the sleeping quarters. The pool was very small also.,Right across from the D Street Lawn which was an absolute blast. The restaurant The Social Register was beyond delicious and amazing!!!
Aloft Boston Seaport,ceciliazi,United States of America,10 Reviews,August 4  2017,5.8,I am very sensitive to noise. They assigned me a hotel room on the third floor. The room is not quiet at night. I can't sleep because of the noise. Also. I slept in next morning. so I miss the time for the hotel staff to clean the room in the morning. They didn't come back to clean my room. I didn't see they place a notice on the floor. which wrote I need to call them to clean the room or they will not come.,The bed is comfortable. Dog friendly hotel.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 4  2017,9.6,N/A,The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. and after a long day that's always nice to have. Its also located in a great area; close enough to the airport while still being in the city.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Stephanie,United States of America,1 review,July 25  2017,10,The pool could have been a bit warmer....,Super clean and very helpful staff. Comfy beds and fun location! We loved the pool and looking down at the park across the street!
Aloft Boston Seaport,Alexandra,Netherlands,22 Reviews,July 25  2017,8.3,Only pay parking ($25 a night) was a bit of a downer. Lots of construction around hotel. not really walkable to restaurants or bars. etc.,Pretty views of Boston. right accross the street from the Lawn on D which was fun to visit. Clean room. Bliss toiletries (which I love!)
Aloft Boston Seaport,Jade,United States of America,1 review,July 24  2017,8.3,I do not like that they lied about accommodating me for an early check-in.I specifically called and they said they were able to provide me a room available at 9am.When I arrived with friends the lady that was dealing with us said no there is no room and it is not ready. I said why would I be told otherwise then. she said it is not guaranteed when we say that. How am I suppose to know that. there was no fine print while we spoke? They should have stated that in the beginning instead of having us travel four hours there to tell us otherwise.What was really the icing on the cake is that the lady says we will try and get you in early and will give you a call when a room is ready and she calls at 230pm. 30 minutes before regular checkin.,Great place. a bit on the classy side. They have a bar on premise. pool table and a lounge area. They also have an upscale restaurant on site. It was also in a great location and a 5 minute walk away from bars.Across the street on the lawn was a nice area where you were able to play corn-hole and hangout on the grass or sit down and enjoy live music with locals from the area or people from out of state like me.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Beverly,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 24  2017,9.6,Booking.com states it has a policy of refunding the difference if you find a room at a cheaper price through another source. I found a room that was about $120 cheaper through Trip Advisor. They advertised a 2 - double bed room instead of a 2- queen bed room but the hotel has no double beds. I was looking for two double beds on booking.com and they didn't have that option either. They didn't hold up their offer due to that difference. Next time I will go through Trip Advisor (the hotel staff gave me a Trip Advisor card and requested I write a review through them which I will do) or through Travago.,I liked their eco - go green policies. The staff were the best feature- very accommodating and friendly. They gave us maps. and even a parking pass that allowed me to take the car in and out of the parking lot (offsite) multiple times so I could get my son to his orientation program and to the airport. He was leaving the country for employment overseas.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 24  2017,7.5,Parking was $25 a day. If you were in that lot. you paid $25 for that day. If you come back after dinner and can't find a spot you will have to go down the street to the Westin and pay $36 to park forge day again. Also. the pool cost money to go to. Things I wish were brought to my attention on the website without digging. When I searched on booking.com I was searching for parking and a pool. If they were not free they should be listed differently/separately.,Location was great. staff was friendly.
Aloft Boston Seaport,La,Bermuda,1 review,July 24  2017,7.5,It's an ultra modern hotel definitely geared for the generation y.  I'm more into the fluffy pillows and old world luxury.  The room was a bit small but well laid out.,The free internet was a bonus and the location was great.  The room was clean.  The windows were awesome.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Lisa,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 23  2017,10,N/A,Loved the harbor view from our sleek room. the competent. friendly staff. and the hip little restaurant that spills out onto the breezy sidewalk and stays open late serving v. good flatbread.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Chelsea,United States of America,1 review,July 22  2017,7.9,N/A,The manager was very accommodating with my missing reservation (she was able to honor my rate). and the hotel rooms were very modern and comfortable! The lobby and overall hotel were very clean as well.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Jeffrey,Netherlands,7 Reviews,July 19  2017,7.1,- Dark room. Lack of proper lighting: just two small bed lights and a wall lighting- location. Pretty far from public transport. especially under rough weather conditions (cold/heat). Uber is your friend. - Although Boston is expensive. 340 USD per night is still way too much. - airconditioning system is not user-friendly- very noisy lobby: very open space with loud music playing over the sound system. music from the open entrance to the bar next door. and from the people at the bar in the lobby,Room was very nice and clean.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Steven,United States of America,5 Reviews,July 17  2017,9.2,No real cafe or restaurant for breakfast or lunch!,The staff was very helpful!We loved the modern elevator!Very good independent restaurant for dinner!

Aloft Boston Seaport,Danielle,United States of America,5 Reviews,June 21  2017,9.6,We only ate once at the hotel bar due to it being late when we returned to the hotel and it was less than appetizing but plenty of other options in the area.,Nice boutique type hotel. Property was clean. staff was great and accommodating to any needs and beds were comfy. Good value for the location compared to other hotels in the area.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Anonymous,Canada,3 Reviews,June 20  2017,6.3,We were asked for a credit card on arrival to swipe for incidentals. This card was then charged for the full amount of the room as well as a $100 deposit. This was not explained at the time and not how we were hoping to pay. We went back to the front desk and asked that the room be charged to the original card used to make the reservation. however were told it was too late. When we were checking out the same gentleman at the front desk said that the card charged had been refunded and the original card was charged. However this was not the case. I'm not sure the front desk staff are aware of what they are doing and when questioned. they seem to tell you what you want to hear. even if it is not true. Very frustrating experience.,The beds are comfortable. however the rooms are small. The location is quite remote. however accessible by Subway and is a short walk to to some very nice restaurants.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Anonymous,United States of America,6 Reviews,June 20  2017,5.4,Hotel was still under construction. Poor breakfast.,This property was quite expensive for what you got. The breakfast was subpar. The hotel was still under construction. but there was no communication to the guests that this was the case. I would have never booked this hotel if they were open about still being under construction.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Patricia,United States of America,1 review,June 19  2017,10,The bathroom was very nice and smart planning with the pocket door  separating the sink area. Lots of shelving. but could use a few hooks or towel rack in the shower area for wet towels and the mat. With two people . there was only one hook. Nice shower tho. and Bliss products!,Great welcoming intelligent staff! Very clean modern comfortable room. and excellent stylish relaxing common areas. The fitness room and pool was great! I loved having the availability of quick healthy food  to grab on the go. Just what we needed in between planning for the Boston Sail events.We liked the natural light and view of the waterfront in the room as well as in the common areas.

Aloft Boston Seaport,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,May 31  2017,5.8,I called a few days in advanced  telling we would be arriving in the middle of the night (3am-4am). once we arrived they had no record of me calling them and they charged us a "no show fee". Not happy about that at all. It was 3:30am and we were tired after driving 10 hours to argue.,The rooms and the hotel were cool looking. Very modern
Aloft Boston Seaport,Murat,United States of America,8 Reviews,May 22  2017,9.6,It would be better if there were summarized information about hotel in the rooms.(Pool location. internet access. room service. etc.),New hotel. cheap parking. close to subway and fancy restaurants.

Aloft Boston Seaport,Christie,United States of America,1 review,May 8  2017,9.6,The parking lot is not right next to the hotel and cost a good amount for one night and street parking is not easy to find since some is resident parking.,Was close to what we are doing across from lawn on D where they have live music we went to Laugh Boston which was walking distance. The staff remembered us from a year ago when we were there for our anniversary

Aloft Boston Seaport,Melissa,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 16  2017,7.9,We are a family of four and had to continually ask for four towels. Apparently 3 is the norm. Eventually we got some extra towels and just hid them so we wouldn't have to keep making towel requests. The only other complaint would be that it was a little farther from the T stop than we would have liked.,The room and facility were extremely clean and in good condition. The neighborhood is nice and feels safe.
Aloft Boston Seaport,CrystalOB,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 16  2017,7.5,The room could have been bigger. I felt it was small. For the amount I paid I felt was a little overcharged for the size of the room.,The property looked wonderful outside and in. The elevators were more modern then I have ever seen. in fact it took me a few minutes to figure out how to use them. Very interesting and fun. Everyone that works there was so very nice.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Dawei,United States of America,14 Reviews,April 12  2017,9.2,We were only able to make it to the hotel after midnight due to flight delays and cancellations. The staff member was impatient and told us that 1) the first night could not be refunded (we were well aware and didn't ask for it). 2) we should have called first otherwise the room could have been given to someone else. despite that we have prepaid for the entire stay. She said all that in extremely unwelcoming tone and the conservation was extremely unpleasant. However. I believe this is just an individual case and was not representative of the entire team. The air conditioner also made quite a lot of noise.,Price and tidiness.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Robert,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,April 12  2017,7.1,The air conditioning unit was LOUD. so loud that we couldn't keep it running over-night. The 'pool' was a bit of a joke; more than two strokes and you're at the end of it. so this was really disappointing as we both had been looking forward to a proper swim. Lastly. breakfast wasn't included. event at $225 for the night. I know it's Boston. but couldn't they just throw in a continental breakfast??,The location isn't too bad. just off the red line in South Boston (we got off at Broadway) and about a 15 minute walk down to D Street. and closer still with the silver line from the airport (near the Manulife Building). The hotel is very new. all shiny and clean. and our room was a really good size. with a brilliant view over Boston. The bathroom area was of a very good standard and the general feel of the place was nice. with clean towels. nice decor and lovely big windows to take in the view. The bed was massive and reasonably firm. with a good selection of pillows to choose from. Complementary water/tea/coffee rounds things off.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Nathan,United Kingdom,9 Reviews,April 9  2017,10,None,This was a last minute booking as we missed our international flight. The staff did everything in their power to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. They went beyond the call of duty and we thank them for that.

Walking distance of convention center.

Aloft Boston Seaport,Heather,United States of America,1 review,February 28  2017,10,N/A,The relaxed but chic decor and atmosphere of aloft was absolutely enjoyable. High level of luxury for the very affordable cost. We got a nice early morning swim in along with a great workout in the gym. The only thing we'd change would be adult only pool hours mixed in with kid friendly hours. We're looking forward to staying at aloft Boston again in the future and will certainly look for aloft locations elsewhere.
Aloft Boston Seaport,Jena,United States of America,1 review,February 27  2017,9.6,The parking situation is not very clear. i accidentally paid $40 at the lot down the street before realizing that it was $25 per night at the hotel.  Also The hotel is a bit further away than anticipated from the center of things to do in South Boston.,The staff was very friendly and helpful with giving us menus and information about the area. The hotel was clean and had a very fun vibe to it. Great value. would definitely stay again.

Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Jill,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,November 1  2017,9.2,Thought our booking included breakfast; it didnâ€™t so stay cost more than we had anticipated. Not the hotelâ€™s fault though.,Receptionist changed our room on arrival for one with a fantastic view of the harbour.Water taxi was really convenient. Shuttle bus driver who picked us up from the airport was very informative and recommended subway pass which was good value for money.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Paul,United States of America,1 review,November 1  2017,9.2,Parking and food prices were really expensive,Amazing hotel.  Easily the best check in process I have ever had.  Amazing location.  Only issue was the cost.  Parking was $44 a day.  Food was expensive.  Still. I would go here in a heartbeat again.  Boston harbor and skyline with water taxi right outside the door on one side. Watching jets take off from Logan and Atlantic ocean on the other side.  Great spot for a business conference as you are right next to airport and can water taxi to city.  No car rental needed if flying into Boston.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Julie,Ireland,4 Reviews,November 1  2017,10,Nothing loved it all,The staff was amazing. the views were incredible of the Boston Bay.

Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,October 25  2017,6.3,0ver priced for small family room (basically as twin room with small double beds).  We were not told (nor was it only any of the correspondence) we had to book a courtesy bus from airport and therefore waited for ages late at night. Room service food was awful (although it was late so we were not charged).,Friendly staff. Close to airport.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Whiskysoup,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 25  2017,8.3,Very expensive. but I think this is more to do with land value in Boston than the Hotel. as it appeared reasonably priced compared to other hotels in the area.,Great service from staff. excellent Goldilocks bed (not too hard not too soft). Great location with views over the harbour to the city.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Tanya,United States of America,1 review,October 20  2017,8.8,didn't like paying $45 to park one night- just too much!  Hotel is expensive - wasn't business travel.,24 hr shuttle to airport was great (pretty much why I booked). Water taxi fun and convenient bonus (but didn't use. too tired). Room was very good. Helpful staff.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,Canada,3 Reviews,October 20  2017,7.5,My iphone was stolen in the dining room. so that too bad. I had to call the police and file a report. The staff was very defensive and rude to me.,Beautiful old building and great design.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,Canada,4 Reviews,October 19  2017,7.5,Self parking expensive ($44.00) Breakfast was not the greatest. Buffet area very awkward and buffet presentation uninviting. Food very mediocre. Plastic  shower curtain liner was "grungy" - unacceptable. it should have been changed long before.,Great view of Boston Harbor. Taking a water taxi across to the historical area. Friendly.  happy staff. Outdoor patio with gas fire pits was terrific for a cocktail or dinner.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,October 19  2017,6.7,The hotel trades on its location and harbour views. but is very expensive. as are many airport hotels.Despite booking months in advance. our room with a harbour view was not available on check-in. and the view was our main reason for choosing this hotel. The staff changed our room for the second night. The individual aircon units in each room are noisy and outdated.,Comfortable bed. harbour view when we eventually got one. Close to water taxis for crossing to Boston. Staff are all very pleasant and helpful.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 18  2017,9.6,Maid missed an empty beer bottle in the shower from previous guest. Did the maid not clean the shower?,Proximity to Logan Airport. Shuttle service was convenient.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Richard Marchetti,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 18  2017,6.7,Noise level form hallway outside the room was too high and we could hear the people in the rooms on both sides of us all night.  The window did not open which how I like sleep. No spear toliet paper in the bathroom. The shower was horrible with broken tiles and the water ran out and FILLED the bathroom floor. The price was a bit high even for Boston. Long term parking is just around the same price for the week at Logan,Being right next to the Airport and the view was great. Nice comfortable bar that pours a good drink
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Eric,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 18  2017,9.2,No complaints.,Beds were comfortable. Hotel is close to airport terminals.Staff helpful. shuttle bus driver was very helpful.View across Boston harbour from the restaurant was very pleasant while having dinner.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Showmetheroom,United States of America,23 Reviews,October 16  2017,6.3,Not convenient to the city of Boston without a car and at $48/day to park at the hotel and more in the city and with a confusing road system and heavy traffic not rational for leisure travel. For that reason I would not stay there again.,The room and the view.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 15  2017,9.2,We did not like that there was NOT a refrigerator and that you charged $3 for bottled water!!!  Restaurant was overpriced for dinner,The included breakfast buffet was nice.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 15  2017,7.5,The service at the restaurant starting the first morning was very slow. The second morning we didn't eat the as the wait was to long with a few open tables.  The lobster roll the first day was not that good. Couldn't taste the lobster at all.,The bed was very comfy.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,William,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,October 14  2017,8.8,Menus for dinner were not exciting but the chowder was excellent,Staff were very warm . attentive and efficient. Views over harbour were beautiful and proximity of harbour taxis a bonus.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Stacy,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 14  2017,10,The only negative (which really isn't anyone's fault) was that our toilet over flooded. however staff took care of the situation immediately and moved us to another room.,Everything was great. Staff were very attentive and friendly. Bed was heaven. the view was amazing. breakfast was yummy.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Primoz,Slovenia,17 Reviews,October 11  2017,8.8,Whenever there are two options of something - one included in your reservation and another you need to pay extra. the staff will always kindly offer you the second one. You have to be always on alert and inquire about everything or you will end up paying a lot more.Another thing I dislike about pricing scheme in the US overall is advertising the price without taxes. and only giving the price you will pay in the small print. I don't really care how much of my money goes to city tax. state tax etc. since there is no way I can avoid paying them anyway.,This may well be the hotel with the best view in Boston. Even though the planes are practically next to the hotel. you don't hear the noise. Clean and professional. Well connected with the free Boston Logan airport shuttle which stops practically in front of the hotel.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Lisa,Australia,10 Reviews,October 10  2017,7.9,Didn't process my breakfast order and then offered that I didn't have to pay but it was included in price anyway. No apologies,Convenience and comfort. Magnificent views.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 8  2017,9.6,Seating for breakfast seemed a little unorganized. charge for water in the room when you are paying $300 a night seemed ridiculous,Wish they were more clear as to what is included in breakfast when you purchase breakfast option
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Christopher,United States of America,1 review,October 1  2017,6.3,Blood on the sheets.  Moved us to another room. but connecting room door would not lock.  They sent up a support person who was able to close it with a wrench.  Offered only a breakfast to go in the morning for our trouble.  The breakfast they packed for us was inedible.  The bagels had cottage cheese on them. instead of cream cheese.Was a very poor experience.,Good location.  Picked us up from rental car location.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,Canada,2 Reviews,September 29  2017,9.2,Again. the in-house restaurant was a disaster.  Over-priced meals. poor service. slow service. and average food.  After eating here once we got outside food for breakfast and brought it back to the room.  On the last morning we ate breakfast at the airport.,The view and quietness from the room on the 15th floor.  The discount water taxi tickets were a pleasant surprise.  The short walk to the water taxi across Boston Harbour and the airport shuttle.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Marion,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,September 26  2017,8.3,From a bookings.com perspective Iâ€™d like to see total costs per night when reserving rather than the cost minus taxes. We were also told at check-in that breakfast was included however as it was a business package this was breakfast for one and we had to pay for the second breakfast.,We had a lovely waiter called Isa who couldnâ€™t do enoughAndrew in the bar was also very helpful and friendlyThe hotel has fabulous views across the harbour and although itâ€™s very close to the airport runways the soundproofing meant you hardly heard a thing.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,FJB68,United Kingdom,29 Reviews,September 22  2017,9.6,Only issue was there was only one bar with very limited seating which was also the only eating place - it's always nice to have a separate bar if you only want a drink. Very pedantic so don't let it put you off!,Amazing view of the city across the harbour. Good fitness suite. Great staff and food.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Elaine,United Kingdom,11 Reviews,September 18  2017,9.2,The restaurant was expensive with not much choice.,The location was excellent with views over the harbour of Boston. Excellent shuttle bus service from the hotel to airport/blue line (underground) straight into downtown Boston.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Dc,Portugal,5 Reviews,September 17  2017,9.6,The breakfast is quite expensive for what is offered. Unfortunately this a trend in hotels in North America.,The hotel location is a must for short stays arriving/departing from Logan. Water taxi and T Blue line Maverick station are a plus.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Nicole,Switzerland,2 Reviews,September 17  2017,7.9,TV didn`t work properly when we tried to rent a movie.  Technician came to fix it but it still didn`t work.  Air conditioning was loud.,Beautiful view. good restaurant. nice staff. quiet room
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Mary,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,September 16  2017,10,N/A,Lovely large rooms.complimentary Starbucks in the morning.regular shuttle to the terminals and a really great welcome from the front desk.Fantastic view of the Boston skyline. Will defiantly be our Logan hotel in the future.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Kevin,United States of America,1 review,September 14  2017,8.3,The maid service was hit and miss...a few times we came back to our room and there were old cereal bowls from breakfast still in our room. The majority of the staff were great and I would recommend this hotel.,A beautiful view of Boston Harbor and we loved the complimentary shuttle rides to and from the airport and subway each day during our stay.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Zachary,United States of America,36 Reviews,September 13  2017,9.2,N/A,--Excellent location. easy access to downtown via water taxis. very close to the airport--Airport shuttle makes getting to and from the airport easy
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,United States of America,11 Reviews,September 12  2017,8.8,Food and service at restaurant and breakfast roomservice food quality very disappointing....,Room and Bed very comfortable... Location and view with harborwalk path wonderful.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Guy,France,7 Reviews,September 12  2017,8.8,The back gound little noise from the air system on the roof.(This happens in all big hotels in usa but europeens are not accustom on those very low noise),The locationClose to the airportClose to the water taxi station (to take the ferry the next day)
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Michael,United States of America,1 review,September 11  2017,7.1,I had asked for a room looking at the water. I would have liked seeing a discount looking at the airport instead.,The staff was helpful and provided any information I asked. The food was good.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Mrs,Spain,63 Reviews,September 11  2017,7.1,Disappointing. quite old fashioned. very noisy air conditioning. No fridge in room and no ice machine on our floor. No coffee type shop where you could grab a coffee and croissant. full breakfast or nothing. Expensive for what it is. Hyatt Regency in Dubai is much nicer!,Good location for the airport and useful shuttle
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Gerda,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,September 11  2017,8.8,Was given an  interconnecting room and could hear chatting next door. Not too bad but a shame.,Lovely staff especially breakfast team and Elizabeth. View across water to Boston skyline. Very comfortable mattress. Good quick shuttle service.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Frederica,Canada,3 Reviews,September 9  2017,10,N/A,The location and the staff were phenomenal.  I will definitely return !  This hotel provided a great waterfront experience with a Coamipolitan city just a boat ride away.  Best of both worlds
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Nancy,United States of America,12 Reviews,September 4  2017,8.8,It would have been nice to have a second armchair in the room.,We loved the view from our room on the 9th floor even though it was the lesser view - it was of the runways and the bay alongside the airport. The view from the restaurant. and rooms on that side. is of downtown Boston. looking across the bay and really beautiful. especially at sunset. The evening we had dinner there the bay was full of boats of all kinds. from small sailboats and water taxis to huge barges and freighters. Dinner was wonderful - blackened salmon with truly excellent asparagus and bok choy at a table by the window. There is a very popular terrace just outside the dining room which must be booked in advance. And a lovely short walk along the bay.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Swissmiss,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 30  2017,9.2,The only thing we didn't care for was the state of the bathroom. It is clean but very small. we were three people and doubted we could have stayed very long without this frustrating us. There is no fan for fresh air. There was no towel rack. just one or two small hooks.  The bathroom needs a make-over for a high end hotel like this. but they won't be able to make it bigger.  Business people will be fine.,The perfect location to stay at when one wants to be near the airport.  The views of Boston from our room. the restaurant. and the outside property are utterly spectacular!  The staff was both friendly and professional and offered all kinds of help.  There is a water taxi right next door to take a fun trip across the water to Boston.  The airport shuttle and shuttle to the car rental were easy and super convenient. There is a long outside riverwalk for a leisurely stroll or a morning run.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Evans,Ireland,1 review,August 27  2017,7.9,the restaurant was a bit limited in choice. could have done with some better quality meal choices,shuttle to/from airport easy and driver very courteous. reception staff good.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Gary,United States of America,1 review,August 27  2017,8.8,Having to leave so earl in the morning to catch the plane. Our meal at the hotel was pricey.  $83.00 for a meal for two with no extras is more than we usually pay. No drinks or desert. the scallops were good but not that good.  I would look for a different place to eat. Didn't get to try the breakfast.,As we were flying out the next day we didn't get to enjoy the Hotel but like being close to the Airport. We would like to come back and enjoy the city and stay at Hyatt Regency.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Sheila,Switzerland,15 Reviews,August 26  2017,9.2,There wasn't a lot of seating at the lobby restaurant so clients had to wait in line to be seated. I think the lobby and lobby restaurant bar could use a bit of refreshing. Compared to the open views and general lightness of the rest of the hotel it seemed a bit rundown and dark.,Love the location on the water and along the airport. Immediate access to water taxi into Boston a great convenience.Large comfortable room with spectacular view of Boston skyline. Also great views of the busy runways with no accompanying noise!
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Orlene,United Arab Emirates,6 Reviews,August 19  2017,6.7,Very expensive.  We payed a little more than USD 450 per room (two double beds) and that didn't include breakfast or parking.  Parking was USD 44 per day; it should've been free considering the ample space all around the hotel. No restaurants nearby.,Although the hotel was located opposite the main town the hotel provided a free shuttle service to the nearest subway station. The views from the room were excellent. The food from their in-house grill restaurant was very good.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,France,1 review,August 15  2017,6.3,Bsthroom outdated tub. Bathroom. hairs on floor and in tub. Elevator all scratched up. Expensive. Coffee not good.,Room decor. room clean(except bathroom needs a redo). View from restaurant. Nice tv.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Jayadev,Bahrain,6 Reviews,August 13  2017,7.5,1.Breakfast buffet spread could improve. Had included breakfast in the room while booking. the same not communicated to the restaurant and had to specifically make a effort after the server brought the bill. No explanation of what was included in the buffet. the server on the day 2 told us the option and only then did we come to know. the day one we had to make do with what was on display which was really very basic.2. location far from downtown and not exactly good for tourists. more of a business hotel with good conference facilities.,The location was excellent  at the harbour side and friendly and helpful staff. Extremely close to the Boston Logan airport and complimentary hotel shuttles available to subway and airport. the water taxi to get to downtown was a great experience and gets you to the heart of the waterfront in 15 min. a bit expensive though at 12$ per head.Also sightseeing tours - old town trolley tours have a pickup so not much trouble to get to the tours.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Barry,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 8  2017,9.6,Parking spaces (see above).,Certainly one of the best views of the Boston skyline. Very convenient to airport. Rooms very clean and comfortable. Restaurant offers spectacular views and relaxed setting. Walking trails along the harbor are right outside the door. Parking lot spaces are too narrow. I know of two incidents. including my own. where one car was scraped by another going into or out of their parking space. The person who tapped our car was nice enough to admit it. another driver was not so fortunate.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Paul,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 7  2017,7.5,Sheets on the bed were either dirty or worn.Property felt like it cost about 33% more that it was worth.,Staff. particularly those in and around the restaurant. we very. very nice.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Hannah C.,United States of America,1 review,August 6  2017,9.6,N/A,Polite. helpful. and accommodating staff. Clean. bright room with beautiful views of Boston Harbor. The dining was also excellent. with great. healthy. and delicious choices. again with fantastic views of the harbor. Shuttle service to and from Logan was efficient and drivers were helpful and knowledgeable about the airport and hotel needs.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Carmen,United States of America,1 review,August 3  2017,10,Food took forever to get there when we order breakfast and dessert.  Food was kind of bland no salt.,Clean rooms and friendly staff.  Overall still good place to stay very convenient and close to water and city.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Casey,United States of America,1 review,August 2  2017,10,N/A,Wonderful harbor view !  I couldn't believe how beautiful it was being literally right next to the airport.  Lovely harbor walk with my husband and 18 mo during our last night of vacation.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Christine,United States of America,1 review,August 2  2017,9.6,Price for parking my rental was more that the actual cost of my rental for the day! The dinner food needs improvement Ceasar needs shaved parm and croutons.. Cod was dull...some pieces of the lobster in the lobster mac n cheese were old tasting ... not fresh and tender like it should be for your location.One of the bell hops said he would come up to get our luggage and never did... so we took it down ourselves in order to get to the shuttle to catch our plane...,The shower was heavenlyThe view was amazingThe beds were comfyShuttle to airport and trolley was great...very helpfulAJ (Manager of the Bell Station) = amazing!! I think that was his name...

Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Iyad,United Arab Emirates,19 Reviews,July 31  2017,8.3,Limited restaurant choices.,The views of the Boston Harbour were amazing! Location very convenient close to the airport. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. We got connected rooms which was great since we had our kids with us. Easy commute to the city in our rented vehicle. They gave us a discount on the parking fees since we stayed for 6 days at the hotel.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Pamela,United States of America,1 review,July 29  2017,8.8,Every thing except staff who were serving in the restaurant. They made us feel different. They didn't treat us well and I didn't want this to spoil my good days so Everyday I would catch a water taxi to take us to downtown and spend money there.,View and location perfect for any one looking for a getaway. stress reliever. fun and just everything good.I probably will be going back soon. It has been added to my list of the best places. I encourage everyone to visit this place and prove me wrongğŸ¤™ğŸ˜�
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,catherine davignon,United States of America,6 Reviews,July 29  2017,10,Nothing could have been better.  The person who checked us in lives about thirty minutes from us in NH&gt;,We were spending the night prior to putting family members on a flight to Japan.  We almost always stay here when we do that.  The view from the room is wonderful....oceanside.  We took the water taxi to the Sea Side Grille at the Hilton and it was fantastic.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Bonnie,United States of America,1 review,July 28  2017,10,That the City taxi company took us to the downtown Hyatt and left quickly. He was told several times what hotel but still took us to wrong one so we had to pay for another hotel.,N/A
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Clare,Australia,18 Reviews,July 27  2017,9.6,N/A,The staff were very helpful. We arrived early and stored our luggage. They phoned us when our room was available. about an hour before check in. We ate lunch and dinner at the restaurant. both meals were delicious! The shuttle to the airport was quick and the driver assisted us with our luggage.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Melissa,Canada,1 review,July 21  2017,6.7,Some of the staff on the evening shift. located outside minding the fire pit guests.One girl could not be bothered. when I asked to order a drink she forgot 3 times...and then when she would walk past me she literally looked the opposite direction to avoid eye contact.Then we sat on empty chairs outside to watch the sunset and were told to leave and ask inside. while another couple had done the same and was not told anything ! Incredibly bad service. I would solely not return because of this. especially after the cost of the room and the cost I WOULD HAVE paid if the waitresses were actually attentive. Ruined our sunset experience as we are newly engaged . Also - a waiter saw us with a case of beer in our hands heading back to our room (we are 30 years of age) and said "Come on man. atleast hide it. have a bit of decency" ....I didn't realize buying alcohol and bringing it back to our room was an issue ! Will definitely be telling others of our experience at this hotel and NOT returning.,Beautiful scenery from the hotel. located right next to the airport.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,James,United Kingdom,1 review,July 15  2017,10,N/A,Great value. can't fault the hotel. Amazing view even having booked late. The location is perfect as connected by water taxi to downtown. but away from the madness!
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Sheila,United States of America,1 review,July 14  2017,10,N/A,Giaseppe the shuttle driver was magnificent.

Please tell he and his boss THANKS. Sheila and David!!!
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Diane,United States of America,12 Reviews,July 12  2017,9.2,The shuttle to the airport was good. but the driver didn't know there was an international terminal.,The bed was wonderful. The food excellent but you should make a reservation at the restaurant.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Christopher,United States of America,1 review,July 9  2017,7.9,I chose not to park out rental vehicle at the hotel. but instead return it.  However parking would have been $40 per day...too expensive!,Great view of downtown Boston
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Kathryn,Australia,11 Reviews,July 8  2017,10,Absolutely nothing at all.,The view from the room across to the city of Boston at night especially was so stunning we did not close the curtains at all!
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Jamin,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 3  2017,9.6,The only issue I had with this place was the restaurant.  Food was just "ok. staff was unorganized and errors were frequent.  The wait to be sat was long as no tables were cleaned off yet.  The wait to order was long due to the wait staff being unorganized no communication.  ie 3 different waiters thought they were taking our table after 20mins of sitting there waiting.  Would 100% stay at this hotel again as it was great but would definitely eat out.,Hotel is great and clean.  Staff was super friendly and knowledgeable.  Views from the room was great overlooking the harbor into downtown Boston.  Overall. Great value for the money and nice experience.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Kara,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 25  2017,10,N/A,The view from our harbor view room was amazing especially at night.

I very much recommend this hotel for your stay in Boston.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Cynthia,United States of America,4 Reviews,June 24  2017,10,N/A,The proximity to the airport was wonderful. Since our flight got in late at night. we went directly to the hotel and the shuttle service took me to the rental car center the next day to get our car. The view of the harbor both at night and at breakfast was great too. Delightful stay!
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,June 19  2017,4.6,The room seemed worn and not worth the high price. Our experience at the restaurant there was the worst we have ever had. The service was beyond terrible. We had to ask to be seated multiple times. and were completely ignored for over 30 minutes after we sat down. We finally flagged down a passing waiter and ordered drinks. Two for each of us because who knew when we'd see them again. Another person came much later to take food order. Food was actually pretty good when it arrived. but that is all that was good about the experience. We had to flag down yet another person to pay and finally get out of there. This restaurant needs staffing help. NOW. We felt trapped because there were no other restaurants within walking distance from this isolated hotel. We only ate at the hotel restaurant because the pizza place we tried to walk to was blocked off by a padlocked chain link fence! Will never stay at this hotel again.,location was good
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Sylwia,Poland,5 Reviews,June 14  2017,9.2,The price was quite high.,Staff was helpful and kind. My room was quiet and clean. There is a beautiful view on Boston financial district from the hotel lobby and restaurant. Overall. I was very satisfied.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Gail,United Kingdom,1 review,June 11  2017,5.4,Location was a bit isolated. you have to get a water taxi over  to Boston costing 12 dollars one way. a bit expensive for drinks glass of wine and a pint of beer at the hotel cost 20 dollars.,Room was very comfortable. views were fantastic.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Katharina,Switzerland,1 review,June 10  2017,7.9,A bit on the expensive side. while some equipment starts to be in less good shape (e.g. doorknob in bathroom. bathroom tiles).,Great location for arriving from across the Atlantic.
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Daryl,United Kingdom,1 review,June 5  2017,9.6,As it seems to be the norm in the US these days the food and wine was very expensive,We had a complimentary upgrade to a harbour view which was sensational. Great subway links straight into Boston makes this the best hotel to be in!
Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor,Viki,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 30  2017,7.9,The pict of the property is very miss leading at time of booking. I thought I was booking next to Science Museum.

Bluebird Suites at Boston's Theatre District,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 26  2017,8.8,Sofa was filthy. The master bath tub drained very slowly. bathroom floor had hair on it. towel bar was on floor laying against wall. 2nd bathroom shower door wouldn't close all the way.

Bluebird Suites at Boston's Theatre District,Anonymous,United States of America,21 Reviews,October 20  2017,7.1,The venetian blinds in the bedroom don't work. there was no coffee maker when we arrived but they did bring one but I had to hold on to the phone for 20 minutes to tell them there was no coffee maker.  Bring ear plugs because noise from street in one bedroom is very loud.,Big comfortable apt.  Near three subway lines and good shopping. Fantastic olympic length pool.
Bluebird Suites at Boston's Theatre District,Sigurbjörg,Iceland,8 Reviews,October 20  2017,6.3,I wrote an e-mail to Bluebird Suited the 2nd day there with my complainings but I still haven´t got any response from them (today is 28 days later). this is what I complained about:Dear customer service departments!We arrived yesterday to our apartment "19G. We were and are not pleased that we had to wait for more than one and a half our after we arrived to move in to our apartment (we should have had it at 4pm). the cleaning people were still cleaning at the time we arrived and they didn´t expect to finish untill one hour later but then we couldn´t have the apartment because the service people who should let us in to the apartment were at a meeting until 17.30. after that a nice gentlemen escorted us upstairs to the apartment and he was very nice. we are not complaining about him.The apartment is not at all what we expected for a 5* apartment especially the bed for the 5th ADULT we booked for. she had to sleep on the sofa bed which was not ok. not even for a child. it is broken and no way to have a good night sleep on it and also there were no extra pillow sheets for her to use. Also we want you to know that the apartment is not fully equipped for 5 people._____________________________________________________________________________________________I can add to this that the 5th adult had to take the mattress from the sofa and sleep on the floor for the last 3 nights and she didn´t have any pillow sheets for the whole time. In the lobby we could not have any help because they said the were the 3rd party and this was not their problem.Both on the day of arrival (waiting for the room) and the day we checked out we could not keep our luggage there for few hours which is very unconvenient.,The shower in one bathroom was nice and with plenty of water but in the other room there was almost no water coming out.

Bluebird Suites at Boston's Theatre District,Makarov Yuanivc,Hong Kong,2 Reviews,September 22  2017,5.0,Their service at first is slow and then they stopped responding me. not replying my email and not answering my phone calls. I supposed to check in at 4. but I arrived at 6 and there is no room for me. had to wait an extra 4 hours to get a room that booked and paid a long time ago.,Suite is big. staff is friendly.
Bluebird Suites at Boston's Theatre District,Kristin,United States of America,1 review,September 20  2017,5.8,Upon arrival we find that we were moved from unit 26C to unit 22C with no advance notice. When asked why the person at the front could provide no further details. Upon entering the condo we immediately noticed the very noticeable dirty area rugs in both the dining and living area.There was a cotton blanket in the masterbedroom closet that was either dirty or stained leaving no blanket for the pullout bed since there was also no duvet cover provided for the down comforter in the closet. On night two the unit to the left if you were leaving the unit was extremely loud. finally at 2 AM I had my husband go ask them to politely quiet down which took an additional 30 minutes.,The location was fabulous;walking distance to pretty much everything! The gym.pool. and toiletries were nice as well.
Bluebird Suites at Boston's Theatre District,Anonymous,United States of America,15 Reviews,September 16  2017,7.1,Check in was late - while the concierge tried to help. there is seriously a disconnect between the leasing company. the cleaning crew. and the concierge.  Also. note.  this is a complex which is rented to mostly college students.Also. price on booking.com  - did not include all of the costs.  Beware - this raises the total price by over $150.  We also tried to stay another night due to flight cancellations.  They don't have a good point of contact and way to stay another day - totally inefficient.,The apartment was very nice and clean.
Bluebird Suites at Boston's Theatre District,Julie-anne,Canada,22 Reviews,September 4  2017,9.6,It's just a small thing but we needed it each morning and had to buy one. an egg flip.,Great location. really nice apartment. close to everything. We arrived to a lovely care package. great host.
Bluebird Suites at Boston's Theatre District,Jean,United States of America,10 Reviews,August 31  2017,7.1,Our apartment was not ready when we arrived at 4:30 (check in was 4:00). It was a Sunday and no one had come to clean. We contacted blue bird but the operator said she would forward our message and it would be dealt with the next business day since the office was closed. After several calls and 3 hours later. thanks to someone at Booking.com the apartment was cleaned and we were able to get in. Terrible service!,Size of apartment. location.

Bluebird Suites at Boston's Theatre District,Welltravelled&amp;wellheeled,United States of America,1 review,July 20  2017,5.0,Hallways reeked of marijuana daily during our 5 day stay.  Parking within the attached garage is horrendously overpriced and rates not clearly outlined on the signs.  Sofa bed isn't a piece of trash-in what decade was this piece of furniture purchased-during the  70's?  We will not be staying here again and we will not recommend it to friends.,Location is the only thing good about this place.
Bluebird Suites at Boston's Theatre District,Alison,United States of America,3 Reviews,May 29  2017,10,N/A,Conveniently located with a great price- wish we had known of this site before as we travel to Boston often. and this is ideal for business and family travel.
Bluebird Suites at Boston's Theatre District,Wei,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 15  2017,9.6,The parking in the attached garage is expensive. Since it is separate. the multiple in-out of the garage makes it much more expensive than other hotels with valet parking which would only charge you a fixed amount per day.,N/A
Bluebird Suites at Boston's Theatre District,Paul,United States of America,5 Reviews,April 14  2017,3.3,The property is NOT in a child friendly neighborhood. and it's falsely advertised - it's China town. not "theater district". The area is very noisy. lot of weird characters. homeless people. The property is NOT smoke free. our apartment had strong smoke smell. probably leaking from other apartments. hallways also have smoke smell.,The area has lot of restaurants. close to metro.
Bluebird Suites at Boston's Theatre District,Jane,United States of America,1 review,January 30  2017,9.2,Checking in was a bit stressful. I gave my name at the desk and then I was asked which company I booked through. I named the two companies that I spoke to. yet neither of those were the booking agency. I was asked if we were sure we had reservations and had to go digging through my email to find my apartment number. I wish they were able to look this all up using my name. I was worried that my reservation got lost for a few minutes!,The apartment and building were easy you get into with the fob. and I liked that there was the added layer of security. The apartment was nice and the product samples provided came in handy.
Bluebird Suites at Boston's Theatre District,Damien,United Kingdom,17 Reviews,January 30  2017,9.2,The property took more money out of my account than the price shown on booking.com but have said this will be rectified.,Great location. very clean and comfortable
Bluebird Suites at Boston's Theatre District,Winnie,China,4 Reviews,January 14  2017,6.7,the beds are making noises as bed frames need some repair work. The towels do not look clean as they have black marks on them. The supply is low. We stayed 5 days and only one coffee sachet provided. We looked in all the stores nearby. can not find the right fit coffee sachets we can buy and use in the room. They did not arrive even after we called.,The room is spacious and the location is great.
Bluebird Suites at Boston's Theatre District,Sasha,United States of America,1 review,January 5  2017,10,N/A,Bluebird Suites provided excellent customer service. They helped me with all of my questions and check in was smooth. The room itself looked exactly like the photos listed and the balcony view was exceptional. I will only be staying here when in Boston from now on.
Bluebird Suites at Boston's Theatre District,Claire,United States of America,1 review,December 21  2016,10,N/A,The management at BlueBird really went out of their way to accommodate us during our stay. We had a flight from Seattle arriving at 7:30am and then another flight to Edinburgh leaving at 8pm the same day. Needless to say. there are no hotels where you can just book a whole day - that would be too easy! Typically. you have to check in in the afternoon and be out the following morning - but we needed a place to put our considerable baggage and. most importantly. take a serious nap.  for a whole 12 hours in the middle of the day with no overnight stay. Paying for two nights someplace seemed ridiculous. but was nearly what we had to do.Once the situation was explained to their customer service (immediately after booking to ensure I could secure the early check-in we needed). they worked with me to establish the best solution. They then escalated the situation to management. who were very sympathetic and made sure we would be able to have a place to call home during our brief and inconvenient stay in Boston. It took several emails but. in the end. all was arranged and the rest of our trip was as smooth as can possibly be expected.Once we arrived at the property (which is beautiful). the Concierge on staff was very helpful in finding our reservation and getting us checked-in as quickly as possible.The apartment was on the 20th floor. offering a wonderful view. and had everything you could need. There was a very helpful welcome kit in the kitchen - complete with paper towels and other kitchen necessities. While we didn't need to make use of these during our brief stay. they would have proven vital if we'd been staying longer. and were really very thoughtful touches - no one wants to go shopping for kitchen supplies when they arrive in a new city.The bathroom was large and well equipped. including another little kit of essentials - toothbrush/paste. mending kit. shampoo etc.Most importantly. the bed was amazing. Beautifully made and very comfortable.
Bluebird Suites at Boston's Theatre District,Shi,Australia,6 Reviews,December 13  2016,10,N/A,What an incredible apartment and building!!After 2 months of travelling and only 2 nights left. this 1 bedroom apt was perfect to finish up with and felt like "home"From the very helpful and courteous concierge to the the moment we walked into the apartment and felt like we were in a display home. to the added bonus on a washer and dryer in the apt was fabulous. Not to mention the added complimentary supplies which were really very appreciated.As a property manager of some amazing holiday houses myself. this property really exceeded my expectations.
Bluebird Suites at Boston's Theatre District,Stephanie,United States of America,1 review,December 9  2016,8.8,It would have been nice to have a few extra towels in the unit because there were none by the pool. but the guest service person in the building was able to help us with that.,Great apartment!

The Lenox,Brian,Canada,2 Reviews,October 9  2017,9.6,ALL hotel restaurants are too fixed on computer menu/price programs. ALL restaurant Staffs are unable to fill a request for a small dish of fruit because the menu/price/charge protocol requires them to charge a specific item. You cant get a coffee with a small dish of fruit because it is not on the menu. The waiter can't write it up and the chef can't produce it. What the customer receives is a dinner or lunch version of the request.,Staff excellent.  Staff really excellent. morning coffee station. afternoon cider station. restaurant open early for breakfast. morning paper available. great location. bus and subway nearby. staff really excellent. ...

The Lenox,Simon,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 3  2017,9.2,Nothing negative about the hotel.,We stayed in a superior king room which was very large with an equally large tv! Free water in the room each day with more available on request. The City Bar off the lobby had a great intimate atmosphere. good service from very friendly staff with good food and excellent cocktails.
The Lenox,Sally,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 2  2017,10,Bed was firm. but because of back issues I need a pillow top mattress. I had a back ache every day. I was back to normal in my own bed.,Very helpful and pleasant staff. Very close to metro system. restaurants. bars.

The Lenox,Bernhard,Germany,5 Reviews,September 29  2017,9.6,N/A,This is a luxury hotel. We had to shift our stay one day ahead - which was no problem and we even got an upgrade to a junior suite. Great location because it is a historic building in perfect condition. There was even a present for the children.
The Lenox,John,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,September 28  2017,9.2,Air con was very loud. view of alley was crappy. my wife wouldn’t let me ask to be moved. No coffee making in room but free coffee available in foyer. Wasn’t overly pressed with the service at the bar. waited around 10 mins for staff to appear so I could get my bill.,Staff are extremely friendly. room was pretty big with great bathroom and tv. Location can’t be beaten. It rained when we were going out for breakfast. guys at the front door were there with umbrellas. pretty slick. Oh I also liked the old school lift (elevator).
The Lenox,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 28  2017,10,N/A,The Lenox is a delight from the moment you step through the entrance.  There is a lovely scent in the air. the staff are all smiling and helpful and the décor is pleasing.  Housekeeping is outstanding; our room was always well cleaned and fresh.  The concierge could not have done more to aid us.  This is a superb property.  I cannot recommend it more highly.

The Lenox,Jonathan,United States of America,1 review,September 18  2017,9.2,Thought the drywall finish work around the bath tub was a little shoddy and took away from the overall quality. TV remote was just a little to far away to change channels when laying down in bed.. I know I know... I hate to admit my laziness but I had to sit up and stretch to edge of bed for the remote to work.,The staff made you feel like you were the most important guest there. Room was large with a great layout. large bathroom and a large closet. Complimentary robe and slippers was very much appreciated by my wife. Enjoyed the toiletries located on the shower wall instead of the standard little bottles. Though it's an old building located on a busy street noise never seemed like much of a factor.
The Lenox,S,Kuwait,23 Reviews,September 17  2017,8.8,The hotel is classical so it has this 1940's look. which is fine. However. the carpeting looks a bit old and the painting on the walls could be more recent.,Excellent location. Active bellmen. Responsive reception desk. Next to Boston Public Library. Close to Newbury street (shops). Close to Eataly (excellent Italian food) at Prudential Center.
The Lenox,Christine,United States of America,5 Reviews,September 13  2017,8.8,Food in the restaurant was mediocre.We had breakfast there.Also there is no coffee maker in the room.  You must go down to the lobby toget it.,Comfortable beds.  Courteous helpful staff.  Great location.

The Lenox,Miguel,Mexico,1 review,September 11  2017,10,N/A,Unfortunetely I had a medical emergency very late at night but the staff was really helpful and called 911. I am very thankful for all their support and i can honestly say everyone can trust in their own wellbeing by staying in the Lenox.
The Lenox,Vivian,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 8  2017,9.2,N/A,The location is excellent.  Many restaurants and shopping in surrounding area.  All staff were welcoming.  Room was very clean.  Had to rent a car for one day.  Car rental office one block away which allowed after hours return.  Great alternative to big impersonal chain hotels.
The Lenox,Lisa,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 3  2017,10,The drain in the tub didn't work but not a big deal.,Very courteous staff. Great location and right on the green line. Late night menu was a plus! An item I ordered didn't come my room service so they took it off my bill! Amazingly awesome! Great beds. very clean and smelled good! Classy and simple. Only there for one night but will definitely go back.
The Lenox,Erika,United States of America,1 review,September 2  2017,9.6,The bathroom was a bit small. Alittle more counter space would have been nice.,LOVED the location. The staff was pleasant and the room was always kept clean and stocked. The turn down service was also nice.
The Lenox,Sommers,Australia,1 review,September 2  2017,9.6,Only 1 turn down service out of 4 nights.

The Lenox,Victoria,Canada,9 Reviews,August 27  2017,9.6,Will need a renovation in the near future,Located in the heart of the Back Bay this fabulous hotel is steps away from many touristic sights including all levels of shopping and great restaurants. Spacious rooms. Staff attentive and accommodating to your needs. Lightly scented ambiance makes you feel comfortable and relaxed.
The Lenox,Craig,United Kingdom,19 Reviews,August 26  2017,7.9,Bar tender was presumptuous and took 25% tip without asking. hoping I wouldn't notice!  One of the queen beds was very uncomfortable and noisy. meaning we had to sleep on a sofa bed.  Cleaning was ok. but could be better.,We were upgraded to a queen suite which was terrific.  We were also presented with a bottle of wine and chocolates due it being our anniversary. which was top class!  Location is magnificent!  Staff. in the main. were excellent. especially the reception and dining staff.  Very nice looking hotel. and great food!
The Lenox,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 24  2017,10,N/A,Hotel  was very close to public transportation and  in a safe open area - a "good part of town".  The décor was warm and inviting with a historic feel. the bathroom had little touches that were nice.  Staff was very helpful and friendly.   The room was a bit small but I was traveling alone and had many things to do in the city so did not spend a lot of time there and it was not a problem.  The view was nothing special but I wasn't there for that and it wasn't terrible.  A very pleasant  hotel where a woman traveling by herself would feel safe and comfortable.  I hope they never change the decor - it's a nice contrast to the cold gray and chrome look that so many hotels have adopted.  The Lenox is not cold and sterile - has an old warm classic feel with modern conveniences!   I will go back.
The Lenox,Teo,Panama,2 Reviews,August 24  2017,10,We wanted to stay an extra night. but the price jumped too high.,The location.  the staff as well as the security are perfect. My family and I had a great vacation. Thank you.  Lenox!!!
The Lenox,Amanda,Bermuda,4 Reviews,August 21  2017,8.3,No complaints.,Staff were helpful and pleasant. Location is fantastic. Our room was very spacious. We were happy with  everything - it's not state of the art in every way. but has character that  is refreshing.
The Lenox,Stephen,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,August 18  2017,8.8,N/A,We stayed in a Junior Suite with our late teenage son.  The room was very spacious and the beds comfortable.  Reception was great as we arrived from an intercontinental flight just after 2pm and were checked in early.  The location is very good being in a nice area and within a couple minutes walk of a T station. The hotel is very clean. has good facilities. but retains a early 20th century ambience (the corridors and lifts being very like Disney 'Tower of Terror' Hollywood Hills Hotel - which we loved). We would recommend this hotel and will stay again on a return visit to Boston
The Lenox,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 14  2017,9.2,N/A,Peter the doorman remembered my husband and daughter from 4 and 5 years ago. He asked about me and was so upset to find out I have terminal lung cancer. He was genuinely concerned and too extra care of my family.
The Lenox,Tony Bishop,New Zealand,65 Reviews,August 9  2017,9.2,Bathroom tired with cracked handbasin and grout missing around the bath. Shame that they don't have an electric kettle in the room.,Location is excellent
The Lenox,Darin,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,August 2  2017,9.6,N/A,I wasn't sure where to stay having researched for hours.  I would highly recommend Back Bay.

You won't go wrong here.

The Lenox,Elaine,United States of America,1 review,July 10  2017,9.6,My wife and I just got married and our welcome letter said "Welcome Mr. and Mrs.".

Beautiful room and comfortable overnight stay.
The Lenox,Nicola,Hong Kong,27 Reviews,July 8  2017,9.2,One of the lifts wasn't working for the whole 3 days we were staying there. Being on floor 11 sometimes meant a long wait for the lift. You could also hear the dull hum of the air conditioning unit if you stayed in the odd numbered rooms. Ask for a room facing the street.,Superb hotel in a wonderful location close to everything in boston
The Lenox,Carol,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,July 8  2017,8.8,Better gym. it was ok however very dark and smelled of damp.,The room was very comfortable full of all the little extras that make a hotel stay pleasant and the complimentary tea. coffee and water each day was very nice touch.

The Lenox,William,United Kingdom,1 review,June 25  2017,10,It would have been nice to have somewhere to shower and change before leaving for the airport. Only the restroom or foyer available.,The head doorman Joss or Josh (apologies if I am wrong) greeting our party when we pulled up outside the main entrance was outstanding. We had a lot of stuff and a hire car to drop off. all dealt with professionally and politely.
The Lenox,Phillip,United States of America,1 review,June 10  2017,9.6,The mattress was a little too firm for me.,The hotel was beautiful and in an historic building. My room was beautiful as well. The back bay location was excellent. a short walk to the convention center.
The Lenox,Colleen,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 5  2017,10,The only thing that we didn't like is how expensive parking our cars (we had 2 cars with us) per day.  $49.00!  But we were in the city.,Upon our arrival.  we were greeted and treated like family!  the staff made sure we had everything that we needed and answered all our questions.
The Lenox,CSelfridge,United States of America,9 Reviews,June 1  2017,10,The fireplace didn't work but they made it look nice.,The hotel is in the best location near Newbury street and shops.  They offered me a glass of wine at check in after I told them about the turbulence on my flight that made me think it may have been my last flight :(.  My room was spacious and comfortable with the right blend of old and new which made it feel classic and sophisticated at the same time. The king bed was beyond heavenly with nice crisp white sheets and a fluffy duvet.  My room service dinner of crab cakes  and bread pudding was fabulous.  They also have a very nice bar and comfortable lobby area.  My daughter. a Freshman an BU. met me for breakfast and we really like the exposed brick and high ceilings.  The waiter was extremely friendly and patient with her vegan oder.  Fun fact: The RedSox victory parade (with the Duck Boats passes right by this hotel) and the Boston Marathon finish line is right down the street.  This hotel really has everything going for it!
The Lenox,Ruth,Australia,2 Reviews,May 21  2017,9.2,Total lack of storage in the first room we had - we got movedCity and state taxes - nasty!,Nice touches like tea or coffee in the lobby in the morning and a big bowl of bananas at reception and iced tea or lemonade in the afternoon.Fire in reception on chilly daysCharacter filled hotel in great location so close to Copley Square and Newbury Street
The Lenox,Gavin,Australia,5 Reviews,May 20  2017,8.8,What's not to like !,The location in Back Bay was brilliant. one street away from the amazing shopping of Newbury street. in the heart of shopping and restaurants district and walking distance to Fenway Park.

The Lenox,Melissa,United States of America,1 review,May 16  2017,10,N/A,This hotel is exceptional in every way!!!! The staff at the lenox are simply amazing.  Upon checking in we spoke to Stephanie and we told her we were on our mini honeymoon so she upgraded us to the king suite with a fireplace.

The Lenox,Russell,United States of America,8 Reviews,May 14  2017,10,Nothing not to like.,Beautiful condition of this historic 127 year old hotel. Breakfast restaurant. dinner. and bar were excellent. Somewhat expensive but a great place to stay in the Back Bay area.
The Lenox,Vlad Laslau,Romania,35 Reviews,May 14  2017,9.2,The only downside is the price.

The location couldn't get better than this. the room was large and comfortable. they had quality amenities. and the staff was always very helpful. One of the best hotels I have stayed at in the whole US.
The Lenox,Amal,Saudi Arabia,2 Reviews,May 14  2017,7.9,Extremely small room. It was unpleasant to stay in because it was so small.  Even after I requested a bigger room. I was told that I have to contact booking.com to do that and that they could not help me. Also. front staff at times were a bit brusque and not welcoming.,Very comfortable bed. and nice soft towels and good toiletries. Liked having complimentety coffee and fruits in morning in lobby. Concierge staff pleasant and very helpful.
The Lenox,Mike,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,May 7  2017,10,Only one thing - no coffee making facilities in the room. Coffee is available downstairs in the morning.  and is both complimentary and good. but I'd prefer to make it in the room.,The staff were consistently superb. We were upgraded to a corner suite which was very much appreciated. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. The neighbourhood was great. with lots of restaurant choices both nearby and a short walk away. The T (public transport) is easy to reach. We walked to the hotel after arriving on Amtrak at Back Bay station.
The Lenox,Christina,Denmark,12 Reviews,April 23  2017,9.6,If we should point out one thing. the bathrooms are old (but clean and functional) and there is missing shelves / places where you can put you toiletries / cosmetics.,The staff was brilliant - very service minded with a good feeling of the situation. E.g. my husband returned from a morning run and as he entered the lobby he was offered a bottle of water. During check in the tone was more like amongst friends - it wasn't stiff at all.The cleaning lady came before we was ready to go. and besides being friendly she also asked if we needed anything and again offered bottles of water to take out during our day. The hotel is self is charming. but it is the staff that gives is the "extra".
The Lenox,Janet,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,April 21  2017,9.6,N/A,Excellent location. stylish and slightly quirky hotel. Great staff. Food from restaurant tasty with great range. Room had a fire place which could be lit for extra coziness.
The Lenox,Anonymous,Singapore,21 Reviews,April 14  2017,10,Old noisy heating and ventilation. Old shower nobs.,Complimentary morning coffee/banana and afternoon tea/cookie service every day. Clean and spacious room. Walking distance to Newbury/Copley shopping area and so many nice restaurants in Back Bay.
The Lenox,Vk,Thailand,11 Reviews,April 11  2017,9.6,N/A,The staff were very energetic and attentive. There are cleaning services 2 times a day. once in the afternoon and once in the evening so that we can ask for more toiletries. water. etc. It is also a short distance from the hotel to shopping centers such as the Prudential building and Newbury street.
The Lenox,Tony,United Kingdom,1 review,April 10  2017,9.2,Complimentary coffee could have been warmerToo many private functions in the city bar. especially as other areas of the hotel were unavailable due to refurbishment work,Room was great
The Lenox,Dawn,United States of America,1 review,April 9  2017,10,N/A,Room service breakfast was very fresh. and delicious.  The room was beautiful and comfortable.

The Lenox,Judith,United States of America,1 review,March 6  2017,7.5,We did not like that the room did not have abureau to store our clothes.  We had to keepeverything in the suitcases. it was very strange.,The restaurant was very nice.  Our waiter wasexcellent.
The Lenox,Delphine,United States Minor Outlying Islands,8 Reviews,March 5  2017,5.8,We had asked for late check out twice - once when booking the room and once at check in - however we were not given that possibility. and the staff communicated very poorly with us on that matter (they couldn't care less). Also. the staff prepping the rooms was extremely loud. we could hear them from our room and it was really inconvenient.Overall. we found that hotel much too expensive for the level of service provided.,N/A
The Lenox,Delphine,United States Minor Outlying Islands,8 Reviews,February 26  2017,6.3,We asked twice the hotel for late check out. once as we booked the room. and once when we checked in. Despite this. we weren't provided with this opportunity. and the staff lacked completely of open and transparent communication on this topic.Also we were quite bothered by the amount of noise. especially as the staff was preparing the rooms by the one we were staying in.,Restaurant and bar are great
The Lenox,Hannah,United Kingdom,1 review,February 18  2017,9.2,N/A,The staff here were amazing and made the hotel for us. They couldn't do enough to help you! The location in Back Bay is perfect for exploring Boston.
The Lenox,Marcella,United States of America,1 review,February 4  2017,9.6,They did not tell me there was an extra hundred charge at the time of check out.  That would go away in a couple of days if no extra charges.....they should inform one about this. I saw it when I logged into my statement.,N/A
The Lenox,Eamonn,Ireland,20 Reviews,January 9  2017,8.8,We were there New Years Eve and could not get into the bar even though we were residents as it was filling up with non residents and I felt we should have been giving priority as we were guests.It would have been so easy to arrange.,We liked the location. it was close to the common.shops.restaurants and metro stations although you could walk everywhere .The concierge  a chap with ginger hair  was amazing with knowledge and could not be more helpful so sorry I can not remember his name . We loved the coffee and tea plus free bananas in the morning . The room was spacy and comfortable with a large TV . the bed and pillows was superb . We ate in  the 3 restaurants and  rated them City Table 1st . City Bar 2nd . Solas a poor 3rd .service was very slow upstairs in it the other two were great and good value .

The Lenox,Nakul,Philippines,5 Reviews,December 29  2016,6.3,minimal room amenities - you have to request for everything. Tiny bathrooms. Clean and comfortable but very very basic,Good restaurants in the hotel. quick room service. excellent location
The Lenox,Mariah,United States of America,1 review,December 24  2016,10,The bathtubs are not very deep but soaking in there deliciously scented products is still a joy.,The Lenox was truly wonderful. My partner and I stayed here after our Civil Ceremony and The Hotel was kind enough to sprinkle rose petals on our bed upon request and congratulated us with free bubbly. The lobby of the Hotel smells like heaven. it was decorated impeccably for the Holiday season. and staff were helpful and kind. I cannot recommend this beautiful gem enough!

Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Richard,United States of America,1 review,November 2  2017,9.2,Had difficulty with malfunctioning air conditioning for a day.

Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Karen,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,October 30  2017,9.2,N/A,Really well equipped apartment. Everything you could need. Great location.

Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,James,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 12  2017,10,I did not receive the check in email so our check in was a bit of a drag. I had to do the form on my phone and it didn't go easily.,Location and apartment were excellent
Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Marta,Portugal,2 Reviews,September 22  2017,8.3,The only negative thing was that no card key for parking was left for us. wich complicated our journey. and this house deserves better mattresses - especially the coach. that requires urgent replacement.,The house excedeed our expectations. Not only was bigger than we hoped for. but it had everything you could think of - coffe. detergent... It has a great location and it´s a great house. I coul'd live there.
Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Vincent,Ireland,2 Reviews,August 24  2017,8.3,Bad stain on the carpet in the master bedroom. Quite expensive. we stayed in a 5 star hotel in the Logan airport area later in our trip for less money. although the extra may be worth it as the property is very central and one can save time and money on transport in and out of the city,Ensuite bathroom. air conditioning. spacious bedrooms. roof terrace on top floor. secure entry with a concierge and key fob entry. excellent access to the T and close to the Boston Gardens home to the Celtics and Bruins.
Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Geri,United States of America,1 review,August 23  2017,10,There was no place open for a late snack. (11:30 ish),The views of the city were great. we were able to walk everywhere . and if we didn't want to walk buses and the subways were very convenient. We took the subway when we went to Fenway. The apartment had everything we neededFamily trip 5 adults and were very comfortable in the apartment.
Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Graham,United States of America,1 review,August 23  2017,7.5,Main entrance access was not well explained. We were unable to leave our bags there for 2 hours prior to check-in.,The overall quality of the apartment and its furnishings
Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Luann,United States of America,12 Reviews,August 21  2017,7.9,The sheets on the bed were very rough and the skillets were old.  I was disappointed that the front desk would not store our luggage for us.  We did find an alternative but other apartments we have stayed at have accommodated that.  Checkout was 11 and our flight was not until 7.,The apartment was large and the location was wonderful. close to the train. restaurants and within walking distance to all of the sites.   The kitchen was well equipped and the appliances were good.  It included a washer and dryer that came in handy.
Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,TheJoshuaLee,United States of America,6 Reviews,August 16  2017,10,Stay Alfred generates a bunch of automated emails right after a booking. requiring me to sign a rental contract. send a copy of my license among others.  The most worrying one was an email that said my credit card was invalid. 30 minutes later I received and email that everything was taken care.  The initial emails were so scary that I almost cancelled the reservation and booked at a traditional hotel.  Luckily I didn't because it was by far the best place we stayed at on the entire trip.,This was my first experience staying somewhere other than a chain hotel. and I was blown away by how nice the apartment was.  It was an amazing experience for a family of 4 and I would stay here again in a heartbeat.
Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,David,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 10  2017,8.8,The beds were very hard and uncomfortable,Very easy to collect keys!  Location was right next to a T station     No rooms were above us so the apartment was quiet.  T is easy to get around on!
Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Linda,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,July 29  2017,10,Nothing,Amazing apartment in a fantastic location within walking distance of all the major sights.  It is right by North Station which gives you easy access to the whole city and beyond if need it.  Canal street is great with a few good bars. restaurants and a coffee shop.  The Boston Beer Works across the road is excellent - we ate there twice!  The apartment is a short walk from North End/Little Italy where you can find lots of Italian restaurants.  We visited the Aquarium. Science Museum. Quincy Market and walked the whole Freedom Trail in just 2 days.  All of these are within walking distance.  The apartment is huge and really comfortable.  I would highly recommend staying here.
Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Andrei,United States of America,1 review,July 7  2017,5.0,No concierge when I wanted to check in. I had to wait 30 minutes for somebody to show up.Hallway was blocked with furniture and other crap throughout my entire stay.Maintenance work in apartment was performed during by stay disturbing me and my family.Neighborhood does not seem very safe.,Large apartment with W/D and full kitchen.
Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,June 23  2017,8.8,We only received ONE KEY and ONE FOB.  We were promised two sets of keys and two FOBs.We called 3 times and were promised another set of keys and FOBs.  We NEVER received it!!!!,The location was great and the apartment was very nice.The people at the front desk were friendly. but they couldn't help us at all.
Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Frequent,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 19  2017,7.9,1.  Garage fee was $30 extra per day -- this pricing wasn't disclosed up front. until after booking.2.  Parking garage access card was missing upon arrival -- requiring calling to front desk to ask them to open gate each time.  A parking card was finally made available the next day after arrival.  The explanation for the delay was that the designated local contact individual was away that day in Philadelphia.  (Shouldn't provisions be made for a back-up when that local contact is away?)3.  Toilet was not working and several bathroom fixtures were loose. The Stay Alfred team took out call.  Again. this took a day to fix.4.  Through repeated interactions. the front desk concierge David was unmistakably and consistently impatient and annoyed at having to deal with us as Stay Alfred guests as compared to his helpful and warm attitude toward the apartment tenants.  We are accustomed to being appropriately greeted by front desk staff when checking into a hotel and having staff be respectful rather than annoyed when asked to help with questions or with problems that are beyond our control.4.  The value proposition for the customer is just OK -- although the price per night seems quite reasonable when quoted on the website. one must take into account the added cost of the fixed cleaning fee plus the absence of on-site staff to address any problems that arise.  The garage access fee ($30/day) and cleaning fee ($40/day) were additional costs; the imputed cost of not having problems addressed in a timely fashion must also be considered.  When comparing this property to others. it should be considered more akin to a short-term rental rather than a hotel.5.  Overall. it was a mixed experience.,The location was fantastic. literally next door to the North St. station and within 2 blocks of Government Center.  All major sights were located within less than 1 mile. so we could walk everywhere.  The Stay Alfred concierge team was friendly and helpful. although their effectiveness was limited by the lack of available on-site staff.  The apartment was quite new and was in a newly constructed building that was partially tenanted.
Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 30  2017,9.2,N/A,Very comfortable space for a family reunion.  We had 2 apartments. Wish they could have been next to each other but it worked out.  Great location. Very clean.

Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Jennifer,Ireland,1 review,March 28  2017,10,We were changed from a different location 1 day before we were to arrive. It was inconvenient for us as we had planned our days around the original location. Once we were able to rearrange our dinner reservations and friend meet-ups. the new location worked out just fine.,Clean. great location and easy to check-in/out. The apartment was gorgeous and we were spoiled for choice when it came to restaurants and pubs.

Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Peter,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,January 8  2017,7.5,Beds to big for the bedrooms which meant there was little space in the bedrooms.Only one small bottle of shampoo per person.

Pubs and food across the street. convenience store and coffee shop below. Boston Garden and 2 major train stations around the corner.  Highly recommend this apartment.
Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Anonymous,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,December 8  2016,8.3,The kitchen tap was broken on arrival and there wasn't any sign or information to let us know.  After a wet ceiling incident. we called to report it and were told that they were aware but it wasn't a priority.  However. they did fix it next day but it would have been more helpful if we were aware of the problem so we didn't soak the kitchen and ceiling.  However. I'm fairly sure it was an unusual incident.,The location was great for exploring Boston - close to the T. the North End and North Station for day trips away.  It was easy to find and easy to access.  The staff were friendly.
Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Anonymous,United States of America,8 Reviews,November 12  2016,9.6,The garage pass didn't work and I was only able to get into the garage after a car exited. I found the check-in process a bit confusing.,Very attractive and comfortable apartment.

Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 11  2016,7.5,I understand that the staff there is not affiliated with Stay Alfred. but they were VERY unfriendly and some what rude.  It was like we were the bad tenants that they wished would just go away.  Parking instructions were not very clear and had to call to get directions on those.  Some small repairs need to be made.  The toilet in the master felt like it was loose and the shower leaked terribly. They are currently doing construction right next door. so be prepared for noisy mornings!,Location was wonderful.  It was tucked away a bit form downtown. but so very convenient to everything!  So glad that they had a parking garage for our rental.
Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Christine,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,October 7  2016,9.2,Cleaning fee is excessive as you have to empty bins before you leave and put the dishwasher on.Had a problem with cooker .

Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Harmen,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,August 23  2016,8.8,The apartment should have be cleaned better. There was a used bottle of milk in the fridge and we found a small pot with marijuana in one of the drawers. which stank the place out. Guess the previous guests must have been too high to remember to take it back with them. but the cleaners shouldn't have missed it. We binned it.,The location is great. close to the Italian district and the old. historic centre of town. Depending on which floor you're on. you'll have a great view of the city. The T (underground) is just around the corner. so it's easy to move about town from the apartment. It's a fabulous apartment. I could happily move in there for a longer stay.

Canal Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Michelle,United States of America,2 Reviews,February 14  2016,9.6,I am very upset over paying a cleaning fee for each day when no one came in to do any type of refresh on the second day.

Our whole party was seriously considering booking another date until we realized we were paying for something we weren't getting.,I loved the apartment. The location couldnt be better. The apartment had everything we cpuld have ever wanted.

Hilton Garden Inn Boston Logan Airport,Gerry,United States of America,6 Reviews,September 14  2017,10,The Wall Mounted HVAC unit is the only source of ventilation in the room (Supply and Return Air).

Hilton Garden Inn Boston Logan Airport,Gary,U.S. Virgin Islands,2 Reviews,July 5  2017,7.1,The flow rate of the shower. though cleverly designed. is entirely too generous -- it wastes water.

Hilton Garden Inn Boston Logan Airport,Courtney,United States of America,1 review,June 17  2017,9.6,The on-site breakfast was rather expensive.  We chose to buy groceries the night before instead.  This worked out well with an in room fridge and microwave.  A small pillow and better blanket for the pack n play would have been appreciated by our toddler.,The hotel was immaculate.  I didn't hesitate to let my young children explore. and I'm usually very worried about germs.  The exercise room looked superb; it made me regret not bringing appropriate clothes.  The restauarant menu read deliciously. but we didn't have the chance to try it.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The in room bathroom was clean and well maintained.  Excellent cable choices gave us the ability to put on cartoons any time of day.  Constitution Beach was within walking distance.  We also passed another community playground just a block away.  If we ever return to Boston as a family I would absolutely plan to stay here again.

Hilton Garden Inn Boston Logan Airport,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,June 6  2017,6.3,Paying nearly $300 per night and getting paper cups in the room was a real disappointment.  This is not a Super-8 or Motel 6.  When I mentioned this at check-out. the front desk staff explained that it was corporate policy . but that if I had called ahead they would have been happy to replace the paper cups with real glassware.  How would I know to do this ahead of time?  Again. I expect more when I pay close to $300 per night.,The bed was comfortable. check-in &amp; check-out was easy.

Hilton Garden Inn Boston Logan Airport,Jeremy,Hong Kong,6 Reviews,May 17  2017,8.3,N/A,A truly legendary team of dedicated hospitality professionals- from the front desk right through F&amp;B. Housekeeping. maintenance and shuttle operations. Property is clean and well maintained. If I were to make 2 improvements. I'd like to see the paper cups provided in room upgraded to China. and showering would be more comfortable if the water pressure could be strengthened. But- I'd stay there again in a heartbeat! The great team makes up for any potential negative. Shouts out to Jessica at the front desk. the F&amp;B Director I saw diligently working the floor on Mother's Day and Kathy at the front desk who made sure all our needs were always met. Nice job you guys!~
Hilton Garden Inn Boston Logan Airport,Jennifer,United States of America,6 Reviews,May 14  2017,10,That I couldn't get food after 10pm. although the front desk gave me take out menus.

Hilton Garden Inn Boston Logan Airport,Irene,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 5  2017,8.8,The price. but Boston overall is expensive.

There is a free airport shuttle that we didnt know about ahead of time until we left. The breakfast is all you can eat and great! Custom omelets and a reasonable price.
Hilton Garden Inn Boston Logan Airport,Marlin,United Arab Emirates,36 Reviews,April 30  2017,8.8,Very expensive.  Not sure that the cost of the room is appropriate to the location.  4 days at a cost of 1400 USD! Whew!One cook (chef?) in restaurant could definitely learn to turn his frown upside down.  No need to verbalize his dissatisfaction with number of persons eating in restaurant. If he can't meet expectations. maybe he needs to work in a smaller facility.,Excellent shuttle service to access subway and airport.
Hilton Garden Inn Boston Logan Airport,Rohan,United States of America,1 review,April 20  2017,9.2,The breakfast was good but the hot items were a bit bland.,Convenient to public transportation. loved having a free shuttle from the airport.

Hilton Garden Inn Boston Logan Airport,John,United States of America,1 review,April 17  2017,8.3,It's a little out of the way and there isn't much around the hotel. It's also a little pricey for the location. I went during Easter break and the marathon was the Monday following Easter so that may have had something to do with it. Still. a little expensive for the location.,The staff was excellent. Super helpful and very friendly. The hotel. rooms. facilities are all very clean. There is free onsite parking.It's close enough to the city and there is a train station (the T - Orient Heights station) about half mile away and a Starbucks down the road. Uber was about $18 from the hotel into Boston.

Hilton Garden Inn Boston Logan Airport,Micah,United States of America,1 review,January 3  2017,8.8,Our room door sealed very poorly. and the air coming around it made so much noise that I had to plug it with towels so I could sleep.,Getting a crib sent to our room for our little one was free. and the bartender gave me a couple bags of tea for free.
Hilton Garden Inn Boston Logan Airport,Megan,United Kingdom,1 review,January 2  2017,10,Nothing- everything was great :) Only thing to be aware of is that there is a Hilton hotel actually at the airport which we got confused about! (Not this hotel) But the staff there were also very helpful.,From start to finish our stay here was lovely.

We also had dinner and breakfast- both delicious fresh meals. with the breakfast in particular being great value for money. Would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Boston.

Hilton Garden Inn Boston Logan Airport,Chris,United States of America,1 review,December 18  2016,2.5,My family did not feel safe or comfortable at this hotel. Ron the head of maintenance came into our room twice unannounced without knocking &amp; without a legitimate reason. 1st time I had just gotten out of the shower &amp; literally was standing in a towel. Accidents happen so I blew it off.The very next day exact same thing happened. This time Ron came into our room unannounced my children were in the room alone while my wife &amp; I were downstairs doing laundry. This Scared my kids &amp; made entire family feel unsafe. When you pay the kind of money this hotel charges you expect some privacy &amp; certainly don't expect to have hotel staff just popping into your room whenever they feel like it for no apparent reason. We stayed 3 nights &amp; this happened 2 out of the 3 nights. There is a nicer hotel just a block away. We stayed 2 additional nights at the other hotel because we did not feel safe at this one. We would never recommend this hotel based on safety &amp; privacy alone. Boston is a wonderful city &amp; this hotel was our only bad experience while there.,N/A

Hilton Garden Inn Boston Logan Airport,James,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 26  2016,5.0,First off. I believe that Booking.com should make a very clear message to prospective  clients that this property is NOT on the Airport property. We waited an hour at the airport for the Garden Inn Hilton to pick us up from the car rental return to take us to the Hotel.   The rooms are not exceptional in any way. The alarm clock we needed to wake us early the next day in order to catch our flight had NO VISIBLE display. so it was useless.  Calls to Customer Service were not answered. This booking is NOT a good value. not convenient. and poorly staffed.,N/A

I didn't like that the hotel services were meant to just get by. Clean the lounge area and up the offerings just a bit and it will make a difference to your business.,The rooms were clean. but we were only left one hand towel and one wash rag for a room meant for two people. This seems to be the norm because the couple we traveled with experienced the same thing. They brought more when asked. but I thought that was odd. It seems to be the theme of the whole hotel. Nothing horrible...it was just get by with as little as possible. Offerings in the lounge were limited. The fruit was very unappealing and the biscotti was crumbled. This hotel is in a great location and if they upped their game just a little it would do a lot more business. When we booked it was the only room we could get in the area and now I know why. Not a good value.
Club Quarters Hotel in Boston,Mark,United States of America,1 review,October 19  2017,5.8,Booked a queen. they put me in a twin. Paper-thin walls. Lots of construction noise nearby. Not very clean. It also turned out that there were much better hotels nearby that actually had lower rates.,N/A
Club Quarters Hotel in Boston,Tim,New Zealand,6 Reviews,October 14  2017,8.8,The  TV signal would drop off occasionally on some of the channels. CQ in A Chicago has it's own guest laundry. unlike this one. :-(,Comfortable bed. and spacious bathroom.
Club Quarters Hotel in Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 11  2017,8.8,Noticed that the towels had stains on them when we first tried to use them. Sheets and towels were not replaced when housekeeping cleaned our room. We had to ask for new towels. which was no problem at all. Also had to ask for more toilet paper in the room. but staff was always helpful and fulfilled the request.,The staff was very helpful and friendly. Free coffee. bananas. and granola bars every day. The suite was a great size for 2 people and came with a microwave and fridge. The location was perfect - quieter than being right in the center of downtown. but only a 5 minute walk.
Club Quarters Hotel in Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 11  2017,7.9,Disappointed with price paid for 2 nights thinking there would be the pullout couch I booked for.

Club Quarters Hotel in Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 9  2017,7.9,My shower wouldn't turn off and it took 45 to address and fix.

Club Quarters Hotel in Boston,Ashleigh,United States of America,1 review,August 28  2017,5.8,We didn't like that when we arrived. they didn't have our 2 room reservation in the system. Luckily I had the booking.com  reservation number to prove that I had booked 2 rooms. The staff was not apologetic at all with the mix up. The small rooms are too small for the price. They ended up having to put our reservation into their system manually which took a good 20 minutes to do.,The beds were comfortable.
Club Quarters Hotel in Boston,Melanie,United States of America,1 review,August 18  2017,9.6,N/A,Our room was tiny. but super hip and seemed like plenty of room if you're like us and don't spend much time there.  The location of the hotel was terrific - short walk to Faneuil Hall. the North End. Downtown Crossing. the Park and Public Gardens and more.  Quite near the waterfront. as well.  Bed was comfy (firm. but not hard) and while our bathroom was a little dated. everything worked well and and the necessary amenities were provided.  Restaurant/Bar (English Pub) next door was nice to have so close. too.  We would definitely recommend this hotel.  We felt we more than got our money's worth - as this was the least expensive option we had on a quick. spontaneous overnight to Boston.

Club Quarters Hotel in Boston,Anonymous,France,28 Reviews,August 11  2017,8.3,N/A,Room was nicely laid out but the suite was really just a large studio. which was a bit of an issue since there were 3 adults.

Club Quarters Hotel in Boston,Richard,United States of America,1 review,July 23  2017,8.3,The room was small and there wasn't anyplace to set our open suitcases. We had to leave them on the floor.

Having cold filtered water &amp; plastic bottles was a nice touch. especially when it's 90 &amp; humid. I would stay there again on my next trip to Boston but it might not be a convenient location for someone that is new to Boston.

Club Quarters Hotel in Boston,Leanne,United Kingdom,19 Reviews,July 9  2017,6.7,Check in had to be done at a kiosk. did not feel very welcoming. Often had to ask for new towels/toiletries as they were not restocked when room cleaned - did not feel welcomed when asking for replacement things and on one occasion felt that I was being an inconvenience by asking. but 2 of us could not share 1 towel! Staff were hit and miss. some very welcoming and said hi when you went through lobby. others ignored you.,Great location for sightseeing. Comfy bed. Water bottle filling station really handy and coffee machine downstairs. Toiletries included. but had to ask for more when ran out as they weren't replenished automatically. Good WiFi and TV channel selection. Breakfast bars and fruit provided in the mornings and sweets and cans of pop in fridge downstairs in afternoon on weekdays. The Elephant and Castle restaurant next door is great.

Club Quarters Hotel in Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,5 Reviews,July 1  2017,8.8,I needed to check in early because I was going to be gone all day. arriving back late that night.  I wanted to secure my room. just give them my credit card number. and store my suitcase in my friend's room (she had already checked in and had a room).  The front desk attendant said that the hotel was overbooked and that I should leave my bag with her and that she'd put my bag in my room when the room became available. and to not store my bag in my friend's room.  Since I had valuables in my bag. I wanted to leave it in my friend's room.  But the front desk attendant said that if I did that then I probably wouldn't have a room when I got back to the hotel at night.  In that case. I would be given a room at another hotel.  She said my bag needed to physically sit in the room to secure it. which I thought was quite strange.  She was very helpful and really was trying to watch out for me so I would have a room to come back to. which I really appreciate.  I know she was just following the hotel's policies. I was very uncomfortable with this but I didn't want to risk not having a room late at night. so I left my bag at the front desk and accepted this policy.  When I came back to the hotel 30 minutes later. my bag was left out in the hallway around the corner from the front desk. out of her sight.  Anyone could have taken my bag and she wouldn't have noticed.  I asked that it be put somewhere else but she said that this is where they store bags.   When I got to my room late that night. I was relieved to see my bag in the room.  Overall. a very strange and unsettling experience.,It was a great location. room was spacious.
Club Quarters Hotel in Boston,Jann,United States of America,5 Reviews,June 26  2017,8.8,Access. The entrance doors are difficult to negotiate with luggage in tow.,Free coffee in the lounge area and water bottle filling fountain on our floor were both unexpected bonuses.

Club Quarters Hotel in Boston,Meri,Finland,4 Reviews,June 25  2017,6.3,A decent hotel but nothing immemorable. I felt a bit irritated having to do the check-in myself on a machine after a long travel from Europe and feeling very tired.,The location was good.

Club Quarters Hotel in Boston,David,United Kingdom,13 Reviews,June 2  2017,10,Had a prepaid travel card which i paid my bill with. On checkout they then kept back money for incidentals which then stopped me using money which was held back on the card until released. i think i should have been prewarned. This is probably an oversight on both of us. but beware if paying this way. This is no reflection on how good the hotel was.,To visit the sites of old Boston or travel and see the RED SOX you could not find a better location. Everything was easily in walking distance. even for these old legs.The hotel pub/restaurant was always busy. so good atmosphere and good food.Would definitely stay again if in these parts.
Club Quarters Hotel in Boston,Keiko,United States of America,1 review,June 2  2017,4.6,It was not worth for the price. We paid almost 1300 for 2 nights for 2 rooms. but the room was very very tiny and we could not get connecting rooms.,Convenient location

Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Theoracle,United States of America,1 review,October 5  2017,6.7,Front desk staff was not very helpful. and acted like they could have cared less if I stayed there.  Clerk just handed me a key with a room number on it with no explanation as to where the room was located; hotel has 3 separate buildings and no map layout of the facility.  There were no bellmen to assist with luggage.  Parking is an extra fee. and the Sunday breakfast buffet was very pricey.,Location was great for touring Boston.  Housekeeping staff was wonderful. as was the room itself.  Little Italy was close. with lots of great restaurants. as well as the post office and CVS.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Margery,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,October 5  2017,9.2,N/A,Great location on waterfront. easy walking access to Downtown Boston. A great breakfast cafe 5 mins walk away - Golden Goose cafe. try the bacon and banana brioche sandwich.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Coleen,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 30  2017,10,The room could have used a bit more lighting. but nothing major. The only disappointment was the hate restaurant : while the food was good. the dining room is very bland and somewhat uninviting. For a hotel this lovely. I expected I higher end restaurant.,I loved the location: within walking distance to many attractions and transportation. The room was beautiful and very quiet. Most important. the staff was super friendly and helpful. Morris the doorman was the best!Also. great bar.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Catherine,United States of America,1 review,September 28  2017,9.6,N/A,Loved the location. It was along the water which was beautiful. It was also centrally located to numerous restaurants and shopping. Staff was friendly and hotel was very clean and fresh.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Larry,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 27  2017,9.2,Restaurant pricing way too expensive.  Be nice if they did "free" breakfast.,Excellent location.  Close to every thing. but just a little off the tourist congestion. Close to hop on hop off. subway and water taxi.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Matthew,United States of America,5 Reviews,September 25  2017,7.1,Lots of little things.   Room was not ready at 3 PM. Elevator Key they gave us didn't work. room service tray left in front of the door. front desk and bar staff seemed indifferent towards providing good service - almost like they'd not been trained.  Breakfast the following morning served till 11.  At 10 PM there was 1 bagel. 1 muffin. a few warm yogurts. few utensils. no cream for coffee .,Location is great - walk to great restaurants in the North End. Fanueil Hall and Seaport. Beautiful property on Boston Harbor. Room was clean and had pretty water view as advertised.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Courtney,United States of America,1 review,September 25  2017,10,N/A,The room had an amazing view and the staff was so personable and friendly. They sent up champagne and chocolate covered strawberries as an anniversary gift. So nice!
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Anonymous,United States of America,10 Reviews,September 25  2017,6.3,The only thing great about this hotel is the view and the service out front at valet. We arrived early so we were told to come back at 3. The people inside were snappy and sarcastic and I found this to be rather insulting. At one point making "man" stabs in front of my husband about how women are stronger. Super awkward and uncomfortable. I had even asked why the manager was so unenjoyable when we first came to the hotel to which she replied that he didn't feel well. I said that shouldn't matter he should stay home then. To which the man jab came out. Then we were going to have lunch and stood in the empty restaurant for 10 minutes to which no one even asked us if we wanted to sit and dine. Bartender could have cared less. So off we went to spend our money elsewhere. The room was fine and the view was what we came for. We had a sleepless night due to the condition of the bed. I felt like the princess and the pea with sheets that felt like hospital sheets not sheets of a fine hotel. Not to mention no mattress pad. pillow top or nice duvet. Even at the Sheraton two nights previously we had a comfy bed and pressed soft sheets and nice duvet. And the bed was to die for. Upon early check out I explained how uncomfortable the bed was to which I got an "I'm sorry." That's it? How about gee we should check that bed to see what's going on!! Not one single person except the valet smiled the whole time. I find this really strange. Last week I stayed at the Andaz in Arizona and everyone smiled and laughed. When I mentioned how nice this was to several employees they replied that "we love our jobs!" You could tell!! This hotel needs some lessons in customer service and some new duvet covers and sheets along with some mattress checks to make sure that the next princess that comes for a stay doesn't find a pea lurking in her sheets and grumpy employees who hate working.,The room was fine and the view was what we came for.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Mary,United States of America,1 review,September 25  2017,9.6,Had to walk across the road to yoga and sauna.  reception was always busy. had to wait each time I wanted to ask any questions or directions.,Great yoga. sauna. spoilt for choice.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Janet,United Kingdom,1 review,September 19  2017,5.4,Contacted hotel through booking.com to arrange transfer from Logan airport as water taxi pictured in on line info. Reply (Jessica) was that they didn't offer any transfers and asked where  we got that information. I replied. but no response so then contacted  booking.com customer services (Sabrina). not helpful. After arrival at hotel found water taxi right outside which had free shuttle to airport on the other side. why didn't they know this?More like apartment buildings than a hotel. our room was in a second building behind one on the waterfront. so no view. unlike photos on website.Very expensive £404.26 ($508.33) including taxes one night room only!Coffee machine. no kettle and water had a disgusting taste.Bought drinks from bar but not allowed to sit in outside bar area on waterfront as we were not eating.We often visit Boston and on this occasion we were there for our sons wedding but we will not be returning to the Battery Wharf Hotel.,Size of room

Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,David,United States of America,1 review,September 3  2017,9.6,Sink drain was very slow. Location of our room was too near the main lobby. thus some noise was an issue. Parking was $50/day. View out our window wasn't quite what we expected.,Bed was very nice as was the room size. Location in the North End (Italian Village &amp; Hanover St.) and being on or close to the harbor was nice.  Staff was good. especially the female staff.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Anonymous,United Kingdom,9 Reviews,August 28  2017,8.8,The eating facilities were poor for us.

Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Anne,Finland,1 review,August 27  2017,5.8,We didn't the room by 3 p.m. as was promised. We had no access to the execitive lounge even if that should have been included in the rolm price.,The hotel was situated by the sea shore away from disturbing traffic.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Sal,United States of America,1 review,August 23  2017,5.0,The carpeting in the room was frayed and caused a cut on my foot. The temperature in the room and not go below 65. The sink in the room  was not working properly. The water pressure in the shower was poor as well. For $350 a night it was definitely not worth it and I would not return,Location
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,ASunman,United States of America,4 Reviews,August 21  2017,8.8,Slightly misleading in that there was suggestion the Valet parking was included online. but on checking out it turned out that parking was $50 per day. You'd be better parking down the street for the $22 all day parking.  The pillows were also seriously weak. some enjoy soft pillows. but I came away with a really sore back having not slept well at all.,Great location if you prefer to be out of the hustle and bustle. Right next to Northern Quarter and Boston Harbour. it's a really nice escape. with wonderful views. Easy to get to and central in terms of the city of Boston and great cycles to use while staying.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Jill,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 21  2017,8.3,Front desk phone attendant and parking attendants left much to be desired.

Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Krista,United States of America,1 review,August 20  2017,6.7,For as much as we paid for one night. we should have had a much nicer room. Maybe it was a fluke but our room was a little dingy. The paint was peeling off the bathroom walls and ceiling and the shower seemed old and outdated. The fixtures were old and a little gross. Also a complimentary breakfast would be nice. I mean come on...even the bargain hotels offer SOMEthing....even if it's just cereal.,Great location
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Lesley,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,August 19  2017,6.7,N/A,Good size rooms. but poor first impression on arrival to find confusion about our booking.  Unnecessary stress and too much joking by the member of staff and not enough assurance and apology!

Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Maria,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,August 17  2017,9.2,N/A,We are a family of 3 and the room we had was a queen double. it had two double beds in which was super for the size of our party.  there was free wifi and the hotel was lovely and clean.  The location was super for us as it was just on the Wharf so really quiet. not in the centre of the town but only a five minute walk to reach everything. the cafe's and restaurants were all around and we ate in some super places.  We even found a laundry to do our washing for our next move to NYC!  The staff were always polite and eager to help.  A really good find if you want to be in the centre but not with all the noise!
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Anonymous,United States of America,4 Reviews,August 15  2017,6.7,The customer service was terrible. They penalize you for booking through a third-party. The Wi-Fi is almost nonexistent. Overall the property feels like  A business apartment complex in a good location. Zero charm. Room feels like an Ethan Allen showroom.,Location is very convenient for early trip to airport. Only 10 min drive.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Brad,United States of America,37 Reviews,August 11  2017,9.6,Would have been nice to have an outdoor pool.,Very nice corner room with a nice view of the Harbor.  The exercise/gym was very nice with great equipment and hardly busy.  Bed was very comfortable; loved the coffee machine in the room.  Well stocked mini bar as well.  It felt like we were staying in our own condo.  We were in a building separate from the lobby with very secure access.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Chell,United Kingdom,1 review,August 11  2017,8.3,Often took a while for them to answer the phone at front desk and for them to action things like room service or general enquiries.,The view was beautiful and they gave us champagne for our honeymoon. It was an amazing stay.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Anonymous,United States of America,13 Reviews,August 10  2017,5.0,The breakfast buffet was awful! Sorry. it was not well presented. and the eggs were not prepared well. they were bland and  didn't taste like eggs. I hate getting in a shower with mildew it makes me wonder about other cleaning practices.The decor is too manly with black leather. The room needs a lighter touch. Black leather is too weird. Glass on toilet area did't  give privacy and door banged when shut.,The view was good  though obstructed. The front desk was helpful.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,tuckeredout,United States of America,4 Reviews,August 7  2017,9.6,We booked with the free breakfast buffet. Unfortunately. their buffet needs a lot of brushing up.The usual eggs. bacon and potatoes. Only cake and some fruit. We travel quite a bit and eat very healthy food. No yogurt. cereal. or otherwise healthy choices. The price for this was astronomical. gladly it was included in our booking.,Walking distance to the North End and all restaurants. historical sites. markets.  no need for a car.Very pleasant staff. beautiful room overlooking the harbor. very comfortable King Sized Bed!
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Andrew,United Kingdom,9 Reviews,August 3  2017,6.3,We had arrived as advised at 11:00am. but room not ready until 04:00pm. we had left NY hotel at 04:30 for early flight and really wanted a cap nap. but fair enough rules are rules.Our room started with a 4xxx. which includes residential properties too. so when the hammering. drilling and what seemed to us to be a bathroom refit was occurring above. whilst we were trying to desperately rest ahead of a visit to the Red Sox match that night reception and management couldn't do anything about it. we were reassured that the noise wouldn't last past 6pm!The Red Sox game went to the bottom of 15. we had to leave at the bottom of 7 as everyone was falling asleep. so it all kind of ruined the experience.,Nice layout on the hotel. nice greeting and welcome with some pleasant looking communal areas. which we didn't really utilise. meet at the door was good and room was of a good standard.

Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Ana,Brazil,19 Reviews,July 23  2017,9.6,Breakfast at the hotel was the downside of our stay. They serve a breakfast buffet but it is very limited. Apart from the buffet options were also minimal. We only ate there once (on a 5 nights stay). Luckily there is a Starbucks two blocks from there.,Location is quite nice. It is by the water at one of the water taxi stops. It was a nice way to reach the hotel coming from the airport. It is only a 20 minute walk to Quincy Market or the Aquarium. and a 5 min walk to several restaurants.  Rooms are big with good amenities.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Oleg,Russia,51 Reviews,July 22  2017,9.6,Buffet breakfasts was poor.

Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Lori,United States of America,4 Reviews,July 15  2017,9.6,For the price I would have liked a better view of the harbor but we weren't in our room for much time anyways as we were out and about.,You can't beat the location to all the historical North End sites. Room was very nice and comfortable.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Sybil,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 13  2017,10,I was in one of the outbuildings so had a view of the water but it was slightly obstructed.,This is a beautiful hotel on the waterfront.

Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Sarah,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 8  2017,5.0,I didn't like that I looked out at the street when 90% of the hotel looKS out at the harbor.Second. the air vent blew the air right at you at your bed and that the kitchen was under my room .which was noisy at 430 a.m.!My espresso machine was missing a part and the room looked dusty which meant they do not use it too much! I wonder why?,The staff and location.The food was good too.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Kf,United States of America,1 review,July 3  2017,6.3,Bartender were very inattentive and one was definitely not friendly. Service was slow on patio. Menu had been changed in dining room because they were out of a lot of things. Very expensive for glasses of wine. Grilled cheese sandwich from room service was terrible-not even grilled and hardly any cheese.,Desk clerk on check in. Location on the water.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Jeff,United States of America,1 review,July 3  2017,6.7,Other than the smoky room all was well,The room was fine but you could tell someone had been smoking in the room. but we didnt complain so I can't say what the management wouldve done for us.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Luis,United States of America,1 review,July 3  2017,2.9,The room the price to much for one day and not a good view.,Nothing bad service and bad Representatives wasn't satisfied to pay a lot for the room we got. And not great service.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,David,United States of America,4 Reviews,July 3  2017,6.3,When I arrived at my room. it had not been cleaned. I called the front desk and they said they would come over and move me to another room. I waited 20 minutes for them to move me. In the meantime cleaning people kept throwing more towels and sheets into the room. When the person finally arrived there was barely an apology.,The North End of Boston is great if you want an old. authentic city neighborhood. Great Italian food is within walking distance. But if you are looking for something else. it's not that close.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Cynthia,United States of America,1 review,June 30  2017,9.2,Wish the advertising had made clear that no queen rooms have waterviews.  If so. we would have chosen differently.  It was disappointing to be staying on the water without a scridge of view.,Bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was lovely...large and very well appointed.  And we found the room to be extremely quiet.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Diane,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 29  2017,9.2,I found the bed to be too hard. We had a bit of trouble getting into the room with key card. but it was resolved quickly. The bar/restaurant area is rather small. restaurant was undergoing renovations at the time of our visit.,Loved the location of the hotel. accessibility to the North End and beautiful waterfront view along the harbor walk. We were there for the Tall Ships Grand Parade and it was a perfect venue for viewing. Loved the outdoor patio and valet parking.  The  room was very large and comfortable. The bathroom was huge with large walk in shower. Lovely. comfortable lobby.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Robert,United States of America,1 review,June 27  2017,10,The windows don't fully open.,Be sure to ask about a room facing the water.

The concierge knew of a fantastic indian restaurant and was able to direct me. all by memory.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Lori,United States of America,1 review,June 25  2017,9.6,Wished there were full size beds instead of doubles... Although the breakfast smelled delicious.

She was friendly. helpful and greeted us with a big smile.The room was immaculate and the bathrooms were luxurious.  Chris from valet was extremely outgoing and helpful as well.  I would highly recommend the Battery Wharf Hotel and will definitely book my stay with them again.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Anonymous,United States of America,10 Reviews,June 23  2017,9.2,The parking was by valet; and a bit confusing where to wait.

Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Sally,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 22  2017,9.2,We booked 3 rooms at Battery Wharf for our wedding.  It was a small intimate wedding and we were getting married on the property. We stayed a total of 3 nights and our in-room phone was out of service.  They were made aware of it our first night and reminded several times but it was not fixed. Very inconvenient for us. We had to use our phones to call the front desk and they were always understaffed which resulted in constant wait time.  You cannot run a high end hotel on a holiday weekend with one receptionist at the desk.  Our ceremony room was locked when guests arrived and not set up at time of ceremony.  We had sent CC info &amp; booked room but the woman misread email.  Staff was very accommodating but hotel extremely understaffed which resulted in a very stressful stay (with no phone service) on such an important weekend for our family.,N/A

Hotel is close to north end restaurants and is in a great location.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Laura,United States of America,4 Reviews,June 20  2017,10,N/A,The front desk was incredibly helpful no matter what questions we asked! The decor was beautiful in the common areas and the room was extremely well maintained and comfortable. Our view from the room was unexpectedly great - - we could watch the boats go by unimpeded. The beds and pillows were so welcoming that my travel partner and I were stunned to sleep in the way we did. It was our first visit to this property but won't be our last. Parking was a perfect 10 because frankly - it's Boston and it's waterfront and it's not easy no matter where you go but the valets made it as seamless as they possibly could. A wonderful property all the around. Thank you!!
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Carol,United States of America,1 review,June 19  2017,6.7,No ice machine accessible to guests in evening after staff was gone. called front desk and they were going to bring some...they never came.

Ordered Breakfast and it never came. finally walked out.  Waitress only stated that the manager could come over and over and talk to us.  For a Luxury hotel which was expensive it was not worth the money.  Will not be stopping or staying there again.  My rating overall was poor.  Reception at check-in was poor.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,gharda,United States of America,1 review,June 15  2017,7.5,A little pricey...,Good neighborhood. Taking the water taxi is a fun (and quicker) way to get to the airport. but keep in mind there is a shuttle you need to take on the other side (by land) so leave a good amount of time.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Angela,Canada,3 Reviews,June 15  2017,6.7,We were placed a room right above the entrance door. It was very noisy and we couldn't get much sleep. We asked to move and they advised us it would be a $60 upgrade. We were not pleased.,Facility was clean and modern.

Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Kenton,United States of America,7 Reviews,June 8  2017,8.3,Being in a separate building from the main hotel made me feel a bit disconnected. The business center was difficult to find. and once I got into it. the computer did not function and I was unable to print documents. The front desk staff was polite. but not outgoing or especially helpful.,The room was clean. secure. comfortable and quiet. Great bedding. great shower. Housekeeping staff does a great job! My room did not face the harbor. but there was a nice "side view" of the water. Nespresso coffee maker in the room was a nice touch. The bar was nice and while I didn't eat at the hotel. the food looked well-prepared.

Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Derek,United Kingdom,13 Reviews,June 1  2017,8.3,Valet parking is extortionate ($50 per day). although there are several lots within a short drive. The staff seem somewhat disorganised. Since our flight didn't leave until 9PM on the day of check-out. we left our bags at the front desk and our rental car in the lot. When we returned to pick them up. the person at the front desk told us to ask the doorman instead. He then told us to ask at the front desk. It all worked out eventually. but it was frustrating to be pulled in multiple directions. No space in the fridge due to so many minibar items.,Fantastic room with a comfortable bed. a Nespresso coffee machine. a large bathroom. and ample room for storage. The location is ideal for most city centre attractions. The beginning of the Freedom Trail at the Bunker Hill Monument is a short walk over the bridge and the hotel is ideally located for the harbour walk. There are several restaurants and convenience stores nearby. Very close to the airport.

Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,May 31  2017,9.2,Service at restaurant Saturday morning was slow. Exhale spa was being renovated. and noise from construction interfered. This was not told to us at time of reservation. Pro Park valet service damaged our car and tried to cover it up. Hotel response to this was lukewarm and less apologetic than expected.,At booking. staff arranged amenities in room for special occasion happily. Waterfront and North End location was great. Low key no pressure atmosphere appreciated. Room service response quick.

Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Madeleine,Kenya,16 Reviews,May 22  2017,9.6,The service at breakfast was awful- one snowed under waitress that took so long to take orders that guests were having to go catch her to place orders- which she then got wrong! I ordered an omelette with various things added- but no peppers (as I'm allergic- but did not say that) so of course my omelette arrived with peppers in it- which I then had to pick out. No offer of other drinks either after my initial juice.,The luxury of a hot bath and a comfortable bed after a long series of flights! Great location within walking distance to restaurants and shops. Brilliant view over the sea from the room.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,May 21  2017,10,The weather! It was raining the entire time we were there but you had no control of that. It just put a damper on the entire experience.,Great location with very helpful staff.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Brittany,United States of America,3 Reviews,May 15  2017,8.3,Breakfast servers were short handed so service was really slow.  We got stuck in the elevator and all lights shut down had to call emergency number.  Our room was on 4th floor it would only get to 3.,The bed was comfortable and front desk staff friendly.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Debora,Brazil,15 Reviews,May 13  2017,8.8,N/A,Very spacious room and bathroom. Hotel was very clean. Good location close to several restaurants. Wifi throughout the hotel including rooms. Very friendly staff. Would definitely stay here again.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Jay,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 11  2017,6.7,truck was parked on the curb all night because there was no room for it in the garage. we still had to pay $50 per night when all other parking in Boston was $24. per day. way too much when we already paid well over $600. for 2 nights.,was a nice place but very expensive since we spent almost no time in the room.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Matthew,United States of America,12 Reviews,May 10  2017,7.9,I received two invoices. The second invoice stated we took items from the in room snack tray. We did not I am trying to get this straightened out.,Staff and location.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Weekend,United States of America,1 review,May 1  2017,9.6,Breakfast was subpar and expensive. Booking.com nearly ruined our trip after failing to communicate the fact of our reservation-which had been made several months prior to the trip and could well have resulted in a loss of available rooms! Unfortunately. I spent several hours trying to resolve the problem-which I learned of the day before departure fortuitously. Disappointing Booking.com!!,Hotel was well-maintained. Staff. including concierge. were absolutely wonderful. Hotel is located in a great spot: central but off the main drag.
Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront,Joanne,Canada,28 Reviews,April 29  2017,4.2,The room was exceptionally poorly sound-proofed. We could literally hear the person next door flipping their light switches on and off. I know what neighbours watched on TV. how they spent their days and how long they were in the bathroom. Unfortunately. they were loud and came in late while I was doing 5:00 wake-ups. Despite speaking to the concierge. no attempt was made to resolve the matter. There was also a lot of noise from construction and fog horns in the harbour. Additionally. the room was advertised as having a harbour view. Instead. it has a sliver of the harbour view that is mostly just the patio and walkway.,This is a nice enough hotel and conference space - fairly typical of this kind of hotel. Nice enough room. reasonably comfortable bed. decent bathroom. Ok staff.
Temple Place Suites by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,October 30  2017,7.1,Room was slightly grimy - hairs left and dust in bathroom. Furniture is a bit mix and match. like they’ve just collected bits and stuck them in different rooms. Blinds broken in many places. Not clear that bunk beds were going to be in the room or that there was no kitchenette. The photos made it seem as though there was one in the room. We had a room directly opposite the shared kitchen. which was open in the corridor not in a separate room. Extractor fan did make quite a lot of noise and we could hear people using plates and cutlery etc. Also looked messy every time we walked past. which was every time we left or entered the room. Also. on our last morning before we checked out the lift was being used for over half an hour constantly. It seemed like the maids were keeping it open on one floor to load it up. The door was being held open as we could hear it attempting to close but reopening on another floor. With 4 big suitcases to move. we couldn’t do it down 4 floors and had to wait for the lift to become free again. Annoying.,Amazing location for seeing Boston. Can’t really get more central. Easy to access the property with the instructions provided. Shower very hot and good pressure. Rooms spacious but bunk bed was not our first choice. Having said that. the bed was unbelievably comfortable. Like sleeping on a cloud. Seems very expensive but is good value for money when you see how expensive other places are!
Temple Place Suites by Short Term Rentals Boston,Sonja,United States of America,4 Reviews,October 26  2017,8.3,Everything was great. apart from one thing. On our last day. as instructed in the email we have received prior to coming to the accommodation. we left our luggage in the room to do some last minute sightseeing. However. the password to the front door has changed overnight. and we were not notified of this. so we only learned about it when we ran into the visitors who were supposed to be staying in the room after we had left. I tried calling. texting and emailing the management. asking for the new pass code. but I haven't received the response. even though I stated that we have a bus to catch. Luckily someone walked out of the building and let us in. however. it's wrong that one has to depend on such things.,Very clean and comfortable. the location was excellent. It was very easy to access as soon as we got into Boston by bus - no hassle with picking up the key. as premises are accessible by using the code that was emailed to us prior to the arrival.
Temple Place Suites by Short Term Rentals Boston,Susan,United States of America,7 Reviews,October 26  2017,8.8,You don't receive info on how to access building until 2 days before arriving so you're not sure if it's coming or not. Also. could never get a straight answer about parking until 2 days (we finally returned rental early and used Uber to get to airport) before when the instruction manual attachment came with access information. Also. we had bunk beds which was not on the booking site! However. we only used the bottom bunks. Supposed to be recycling bins on site but could never find them. Air conditioning unit had been disassembled but handy husband put it back although maintenance would have been there the following day to reassemble (they answer your texts immediately).,Location was right near Boston Common and very easy to get around. Great little breakfast place right across street and many more restaurants nearby. Very clean. Felt very safe after having to put 3 different codes for doors at different levels although I would not stay here alone or venture out alone at night.
Temple Place Suites by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anonymous,New Zealand,6 Reviews,October 26  2017,8.5,The elevator was out of action being serviced when we left.  Had to get our suitcases from floor 5 to street level down the stairs.,The location beside Boston Common
Temple Place Suites by Short Term Rentals Boston,Ronda,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 23  2017,6.7,outside keypad didn't work. our room was on the 6Th floor but elevator only went up to the 5Th floor. so we had to carry our luggage up a flight of stairs.

Temple Place Suites by Short Term Rentals Boston,Marion,France,4 Reviews,October 21  2017,6.3,Bad soundproofing. We didn't sleep very well because of that. Plus. the location is great but there was weird people in the street that tried to come into the building when we got out. It didn't feel too insecure. though. Besides. the lower bed was fine (really comfortable) but the upper bed was not firm at all. and moved a lot when below people moved. The TV was low-quality.,The appartment was clean. the equipment description was accurate. we appreciated the wifi. the air conditionner. It does not come with keys but with codes. so that any of us 4 could come and go as they wanted.
Temple Place Suites by Short Term Rentals Boston,Elena,Canada,28 Reviews,October 17  2017,6.0,The apartment was very hot and there was no possibility to open the window.

Temple Place Suites by Short Term Rentals Boston,David,Australia,2 Reviews,October 15  2017,5.0,Hosts are never on premises. Did not answer/return phone calls. Did not return emails. Access is by 4 coded locked doors. My instruction lead to the wrong apartment number (I still have them). How was I supposed to enter my apartment? (No one around. no one answers the phone. while arriving to Boston from Sydney Australia.) Tried to contact several more times. There were burnt lights. and no operating instructions. One is there at their own risk:  no recourse for any mishap. The Owners seem to believe that they have a money generating device that needs no attention. Other tenants had similar experiences. One was assigned a floor with no elevator access . having to carry a baby and a trolley up the stairs. failing to contact the owners for days... Setup and interiors highly fundamental. but acceptable.,Location. cleanliness
Temple Place Suites by Short Term Rentals Boston,Borys,Canada,1 review,October 12  2017,3.8,There is no communication with actual property  staff  or stuff of booking.com- nobodies responsible for your stay. Dirty entrance to building with 6 guys smoking weeds at the door. DIRTY - Dirty room with dirty never been cleaned bed . All you have its a phone numbers that nobodies is answering on. You cannot cancel your stay and cannot ask for "Clean the f room! I am in need to sleep".   Property's Staff have begin to answer by Messaging (?!) when it was closer to midnight . They ask me to go in to some room with new bed sheets  and to have change them by myself. Next day - the room was clean but at 11pm the were people coming to my room (room with one bad . and no - you cannot lock yourself from inside) - apparently they have got  the same room booked  by email. Will never recommend to any one and will try to stay away from Booking .com,Only Location

Temple Place Suites by Short Term Rentals Boston,Dom,United Kingdom,15 Reviews,October 2  2017,7.5,I had room 501 which looks onto the main street below - it gets noisy so if you don't like noise then ask for a room away from the road side of the building. There were bin lorries and street cleaning going on all night. There is a double bunk bed which was fine but it doesn't leave a lot of room in the sleeping half of the room.  If the beds are designed for 4 the seating/living area is only designed for 2.,The whole apartment is operated by key pads on doors (you get the codes in an email a couple of days before arrival) so you don't actually meet any staff or need a physical key. The bar across the road is excellent.
Temple Place Suites by Short Term Rentals Boston,Larae,United States of America,8 Reviews,September 27  2017,8.3,There was a group of teenagers having a party a couple floors down.

Temple Place Suites by Short Term Rentals Boston,Rim,Switzerland,3 Reviews,September 13  2017,2.9,Smelly. dirty bed (hair on bedsheets). I cleaned floor under the bed. cracked windows. cold air draft through windows. not sound proof. could hear every word said on the noisy street below although we were on the 3rd floor. staff not available on weekends. nowhere safe to leave luggage. tiny room. not at all in line with published pictures! This was the worst experience ever. this place is a shame and shouldn't even be listed as part of Booking.com selection!,Worst property ever!! Ridiculously expensive. pictures do not at all reflect the reality of a filthy. badly kept place! We left after the first night although we had booked 2 nights in Boston. and for almost the same price were in a beautiful clean Hilton Hotel room!
Temple Place Suites by Short Term Rentals Boston,Jos,Netherlands,12 Reviews,September 8  2017,4.2,Photo's on booking did not represent reality. Room was very small. about 13 m2. and very narrow and packed. Indicated was that shower and toilet would be shared. Apart from that. the kitchen is also shared. This sitting area in the picture is also outside the room. The pictures give a false picture of the actual situation.It was difficult to enter the room. The landlord mentioned the wrong floor and the wrong entrance door. The phone number to call in such situations was initially unreachable. but responded by SMS after some time.When I complained about the difference between picture and reality. the landlord offered a refund of 24% of the rent.In a SMS message the owner blames Booking far changing the description of the house. That does not sound very convincing.,N/A
Temple Place Suites by Short Term Rentals Boston,Kathryn,United States of America,1 review,September 2  2017,7.9,No nice view out windows. Only looked out at outside bldg.  corridor. Needed shelving and hooks in bathroom. Limited spot to hang wet bath towels. No bathroom bathmat. No clean bath towels supplied half way thru stay.  No secure spot to leave our luggage prior to leaving later in the day,Great location right across street from Boston Commons and convience to Logan airport.  Kitchen well supplied with appliances but no dish washer. Great security for entrance into bldg as well as entrance to elevator. entrance to floor and finally entrance to room.
Temple Place Suites by Short Term Rentals Boston,Tannera Ingram,United States of America,1 review,September 1  2017,6.7,The entrance was a little run down and the elevator was kind of gross and smelled weird.

Temple Place Suites by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anonymous,Switzerland,1 review,August 27  2017,8.3,Overall it was very noisy. A lot of people had parties. thus. it was not easy to get sleep.,The appartment and the kitchen were well equipped with everything needed for a comfortable stay.
Temple Place Suites by Short Term Rentals Boston,Colin,Australia,6 Reviews,August 26  2017,6.7,We had a three night stay. The check in time of not until 4pm is inconvenient when you have been travelling all night. No one on site. It would be nice to know this at the time you see the add on bookings.com Yes we could leave our luggage in the lobby but at our own risk which we chose not to do so we were on the street all day towing our luggage. Information to gain access to the building doesn't come to you until two days before you arrive and by email. This is inconvenient if you don't have access to wi fi as you don't when you are travelling in from overseas. Again it would be nice to know this on the booking.com ad. The weather was very hot and when we gained access to the room it was very hot and humid. The small portable air conditioning in the room was of no use so we eventually turned it off and opened the windows. The management were not easy to contact and many of our calls went unanswered and invited to leave a message or send SMS. The TV didn't work and wasn't fixed until the afternoon before we left. As for cleanliness. the room was fine except for the cooked rice still in the sink from the last guest.,The location was excellent. The beds were very comfortable.

Where it stayed for three days. Cleaning woman showed up 20 minutes before we were supposed to leave. Hotplate was dirty. shower rod is rusty. Just added to the uncared-for feeling.,The bunk beds were very comfortable. though it was hard for old. adult me to clamber up the ladder made of pipe. once I got up there I was happy enough.

Temple Place Suites by Short Term Rentals Boston,Mostly,United States of America,1 review,July 31  2017,7.1,When I booked this room. I did say it was for 4 guests. but only 2 towels were provided for the 4 of us. which was sub-ideal. Additionally. no toilet paper was provided. even though the email I received said it was included. The hotel doesn't have weekend hours. or any onsite staff. so there was no one to help us out with towels or TP. so we had to buy our own.,The location is in an area that's changing a lot. so its got access to a lot of things. but not ideal for walking around alone at night. The room was very clean (some of the drawers in the bathroom had hair clippings from previous guests. so. could have been cleaner). The beds were very very comfortable and the linens were very cozy!Definitely good for an inexpensive place to stay. when you're looking for a crash pad in Boston.

Chandler Inn Hotel,Debbie,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 8  2017,8.8,First impression of the bed was that it would be uncomfortable. However. it turned out to be comfortable to sleep in although it was noisy. i.e.. each time my husband sat on the bed or got up. it made a creaking noise so I feared that would keep us both awake all night but it did not.,The hotel location is ideal for walking to restaurants. The bar was bustling. drink prices were reasonable. and the hummus and tzatsiki were outstanding!

Chandler Inn Hotel,Dartv,Italy,21 Reviews,August 28  2017,8.3,It has no many additional services.

Compared with other hotel in Boston. it has a goor price-to-quality ratio
Chandler Inn Hotel,Merlyn,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,August 5  2017,7.5,Very basic for the money but then Boston seems to be an expensive place to stay.

Specially Zac. They were so helpful and we laughet a lot during check in. The room was small but very ok. And the location was in a very nice neighbourhood. close to the T and everything else actually. Very cool shower. you didn't have to stand under the ice cold water when turning the water on. since you turned it on in the back. where you didn't get wet while waiting for the warm water. This really is a first world "problem" but still. it is a very nice feauture ;-)

Chandler Inn Hotel,Jonathan,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 12  2017,8.3,N/A,small boutique hotel - perfect if you don't need a lot of room to spread out.  Food in the bar downstairs is really good too - check out the "Appy Hour from 4-6" all appetizers are $8.00.  For me. wasn't a lot of choices for my taste. but I'm a bit picky.  Staff is friendly and helpful. though night staff is not as attentive (IMO) as the day staff.  Evenings get a bit exiting with the bar -which gets busy and stays busy late into the night (you'll hear the music and people on the street).  If that bothers you -just bring some ear plugs - Perfectly located near great food and neighborhoods.  Close to public transportation as well.I stay here every time I come to Boston! (Wish they had a frequent stay program).

Chandler Inn Hotel,Nick,United Kingdom,17 Reviews,June 1  2017,6.3,Unfortunately. although in a convenient location. for me the hotel has little character.

The Trophy Room restaurant is very convenient for an 'on the spot' supper. with tasty food.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Derek,United Kingdom,13 Reviews,June 1  2017,6.3,The toilet wouldn't stop running despite attempts to fix it. the heater wouldn't work unless it was turned all the way up. and the walls were paper-thin.

Chandler Inn Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,8 Reviews,May 22  2017,3.3,Staff members at the front desk are some of the most unprofessional. disrespectful people I've ever come across in hotels. Not only one. but two of them. were visibly irritable when asked about simple logistical questions. Rude manner on the phone as well. showing no empathy toward travelers. As a South End resident and hospitality professional myself. I feel ashamed of this disappointing establishment in my own neighborhood and would never invite my visiting family and friends to stay here ever again. Too bad.,The location
Chandler Inn Hotel,Steve,Australia,1 review,May 19  2017,8.8,Older design and decor could put some people off this place.,Clean and comfortable with easy access to what we wanted to see and do.  Public transport within easy walking distance.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Raymond,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,May 17  2017,8.3,Saturdays And Sundays breakfast does not start until 10am.Could not put meals or drinks in the bar on the hotel bill.No tea making facility in the room.No wardrobe only one bedside cabinet full of blankets,N/A
Chandler Inn Hotel,Mark,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,May 2  2017,6.3,Tired decor. no kettle in room. some of the staff rather grumpy - not the usual standard we expect from American hotels.,Good location in the trendy South End and convenient for walking to  most of the sights in Boston.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Olafur,Iceland,3 Reviews,May 1  2017,7.5,It could use a little update. The wallpaper was coming loose and the carpet worn out.,The bed was very comfy and the location is great. The staff was very nice and the room was clean.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Laura,United States of America,1 review,May 1  2017,7.5,There was nothing that I couldn't tolerate. Bathroom is small. I like hot showers and the water didn't stay warm long enough for me.,Chandler Inn is a no frills place to stay. but the price was okay. Free Wifi.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,April 24  2017,4.2,No closets. tiny bathroom. no insulation from noise of neighbor's TV. teenie size room. very overpriced. no restaurant,Location otherwise this hotel offers NOTHING.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Angela,United States of America,1 review,April 24  2017,7.9,The bathroom walls/door were extremely thin so you hear absolutely everything from the bedroom area. The shower also never really got hot enough but was fine for a quick shower.,The bed was comfortable. It was a fine size room for just my fiance and myself for the weekend.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Vitoria,Spain,28 Reviews,April 23  2017,7.1,Rooms need some maintenance  although bathroom was better.No window blinds.Our room 7th floor much older than photos on web page.,Great staff.Good bar/restaurant downstairs.Location good.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Jo-anne,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,April 21  2017,8.3,Wifi was on and off (intermittent) in the suites which was annoying as it was my only method of communication with family during my stay. A shame the cost was so expensive. obviously the prices were put up due to the marathon which is the major downside.,I got upgraded to one of the suites across the road and thank god I did as the hotel restaurant was so noisy on the weekend!! Lovely clean suites though.  Location perfect for the marathon.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Ishan Khanna,India,7 Reviews,April 18  2017,5.8,The room was extremely small for the price I paid. Didn't have any facilities. All in all. not worth spending this much money for this hotel. You're better off in a hostel if you are traveling alone. than in this hotel.,Quite close to the financial district of Boston. The prudential tower is walkable from this place. Boston common and the back isn't far either. on foot.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Christopher,United States of America,1 review,April 17  2017,7.9,The  room was a bit small but thats to be expected for an old building.,The hotel was a hidden gem. and was recently renovated. Great location and great service. The room was clean and well appointed. Best of all the prices were lower than other hotels. Definateley reccomend this hotel.
Chandler Inn Hotel,ChanCynthia,United States of America,7 Reviews,April 17  2017,7.1,Ran out of coffee in the morning so we didn't get to have any.  A bit musty smelling in the room.,Close proximity to restaurants and everything you would want to see in Boston.  Room was small but comfortable.  Bathroom was clean.  Staff was nice.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Jun-hua,Taiwan,1 review,April 14  2017,8.3,I stayed in the second floor and just upon the bar. So it was extremely noisy during nights. Besides the price was a bit high when i booked. but I supposed it might be caused by the AAG conference in Boston during the period.,The location is perfect. That is the main reason why i booked this hotel few months ago. Staff here is also helpful. and is always willing to help me and answer to a tourist's question. I feel comfortable in this hotel. You can get free coffee when coming back to the hotel. Coffee is important to me. as a coffee-holic. Besides. I also enjoyed the restroom in my room. Comfortable and warm water is always ready.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Nancy,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 12  2017,9.6,Rooms were a bit small. Wifi is slow. Not in the main part of town but within walking distance.,They allowed us to check in early. Very clean. very nice staff. Restaurant is next door. Reasonably priced.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Stephen,United States of America,13 Reviews,April 10  2017,5.0,My room was situated on the second floor and the attached bar downstairs had very loud music thudding out until 2am. This meant I was unable to get to sleep until it had closed for the night - and I can sleep through anything. I called down to ask but was told that 'yes - it is always loud but there are no other rooms'. I think that when this is a known problem they should probably let you know when booking or upon check-in. This was very frustrated and when spending more than $200 on a hotel room. I expect to be able to get to sleep in it.,The hotel is a nice local hotel with friendly staff.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Gina,United States of America,3 Reviews,April 8  2017,6.7,The beds were very uncomfortable. Our room was right next the door that separated the hall from the stairwell/elevator area. People kept slamming the door all night waking us up and making us uncomfortable how close it sounded to our door.,Everything was very clean. The room decor was very modern and neat. It met our needs for a one night stay. Location is great to walk and hangout on Newberry St ect.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Bryn,United States of America,1 review,March 18  2017,9.6,N/A,Pleasantly surprised. Good location and great value. Room was pleasant and clean. staff was very helpful. Upper floors are better. though (I was on 6th floor). Otherwise. you might get spillover noise from the very popular attached bar.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Daniel,Canada,10 Reviews,March 17  2017,7.5,The wifi was not that good. Rooms were a little small and bathrooms were quite cramped for a hotel but there was a charm to the place.,Location was great. Right in the heart of the city. easy to walk places and only 20m from the airport.
Chandler Inn Hotel,victorliu,China,4 Reviews,March 15  2017,3.3,I have booked twin beds. but they offered small queen bed for two big size men. the heater was with problem when we settled down our six big luggages. then we had to change the room. final we got a twin beds room by strong request after three days.The sheet is dirty. bed is very small. room is noisy,Very poor hotel
Chandler Inn Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,March 10  2017,9.2,The room and bathroom were small but very updated and clean.,The attached bar (Trophy Room) was packed when we finally got back in the evening. Fun crowd - very friendly. Couldn't hear anything from the room when we left
Chandler Inn Hotel,Dnipropetrovsk,United States of America,3 Reviews,March 8  2017,9.2,The bed was a little uncomfortable and I could not figure out how to turn on the air system. It was very complicated . No instructions.,The room was very neat and clean. The bathroom was exceptionally neat and clean.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Visitor,United Kingdom,1 review,February 27  2017,5.8,The bed was very uncomfortable. It was tough to get a good night sleep,The location was great. and it was easy to walk to everywhere we wanted to explore!
Chandler Inn Hotel,Shameika,United States of America,1 review,February 26  2017,7.5,Thr room was smaller than what it looked like online!!

Chandler Inn Hotel,Zachary,United States of America,1 review,February 20  2017,8.3,The front desk staff was unclear about the parking situation and ended up causing  me to spend a lot on it. There is no free parking at The Chandler - instead. they direct you to a nearby garage that gets a meager discount and still runs you $28 a day. I tried explaining to a staff member the confusion in the hopes that he would maybe apologize or learn to be more clear. but he became defensive and rude. Just a heads up!,Excellent location. mostly friendly sraff
Chandler Inn Hotel,Barbara,United States of America,5 Reviews,February 13  2017,9.6,Our only two less-than-stellar comments would be 1) improve the strength and brand of coffee offered in the lobby and 2) have housekeeping use a neutralizing odor freshener in the vacuum for the hallways. (I'm a Property Management Professional by trade :-) ) it won't deter us from coming back!! Great spot.,We loved the staff! The Trophy restaurant was an absolute plus. Travis was a fabulous server and Mike the bartender knew his craft! Our room was warm and very comfortable! Loved the shower and cleanliness of the room.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Miranda,United States of America,9 Reviews,February 1  2017,7.1,I waited about 10 minutes at the desk before someone arrived to check me in. The bed was not very comfortable and top sheet had stains. The walls were very thin and privacy that way was an issue,The location and restaurant were the best parts!
Chandler Inn Hotel,Danielle,United States of America,1 review,January 31  2017,9.6,the room was a little small besides that great experience.,the location was prime. staff were fantastic and the rooms and facility where very clean. there is a nice bar next to the hotel with great staff and food. the bathroom has a very nice stand up shower that was a bonus :)
Chandler Inn Hotel,Kenzie,Canada,1 review,January 30  2017,7.1,N/A,The Chandler Inn is a great place to stay. It in the south end of Boston. but Boston is a city where you can basically walk anywhere. and the transit system is amazing. There's great places to dine all around the neighbourhood and the bar attached to the hotel. the Trophy Room was always busy at night and really fun!  The beds were comfortable and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel rooms are very small and the wifi was a little bit weak ( was still able to check social media and email. but if you're streaming it may be difficult for you) Yes. the rooms are very small. so if you intend on staying in your hotel room for your entire trip. this place might not be for you. Rooms were very clean and our towels and tolietries were kept well restocked during our weekend there! Great place overall!
Chandler Inn Hotel,Bradley,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,January 28  2017,8.8,N/A,This Hotel is in a Great Location with most of Bostons sights a 5-10min walk away. Close to Back Bay Station. so ideal for transfers to Logan Airport.Hotel looks small from the outside but the rooms are a fair size. clean and moden.For a Good nights Sleep request a high floor. level 5 or higher. this is because of a bar on the ground floor.....you can't hear it but just in case...go high!!Staff friendly and always happy to help. I'd return here if I return to Boston
Chandler Inn Hotel,Sean,Ireland,8 Reviews,January 28  2017,8.8,Shower leaked water out on the fault (poor design)  and so after any shower the floor was soaked and we had to put towels down on it. That said.  that was just a design fault.,Very friendly and helpful staff. It was great that the bar was attached to the hotel and that the hotel is centrally located.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Erik,United States of America,12 Reviews,January 27  2017,9.6,Need a shelf for personal items in the bathroom.Need at the minimum:-one vertical grab bar at the entrance to the shower. to stabilize a guest entering the shower area-One short horizontal grab bar over the shower control to prevent a guest from using the shower control handle for stability.-one horizontal grab bar in the shower area to stabilize a guest.-a horizontal contrasting color line in the shower area about 60" high to provide a visual reference for level and wall proximity. Can be either replacing some tile. adding decorative tile over the existing. or even painting a permanent line.I am happy to share more ideas!,N/A
Chandler Inn Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,January 26  2017,6.7,The bed was uncomfortable to sleep on for more than a few hours.

Chandler Inn Hotel,Neckdanger,Finland,5 Reviews,January 16  2017,4.2,Really noisy and cold place. They will not accept any requests about the room because when I reserved the room I asked for a quiet room and what did I got? The loudest room of the hotel which was right on top of the bar downstairs and in the corner of very busy street. Then I asked different room and got it. but it was next to this couple who partied all night long and smoked marihuana and the smell came to our non-smoking room and almost made me throw up. Room keys stopped working twice so they have problem with that.Bathrooms are very small and cold. Wi-fi doesn't work properly.,None.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Kelsey,United States of America,1 review,January 6  2017,5.4,Honestly one of the jenkiest hotels I've stayed in. They had to change my room initially twice. The first room was full of cigarette smoke in a nonsmoking room. The second the toilet wouldn't flush. In the third. the sink drain was closed shut. the heater didn't work properly. the TV wouldn't turn on and the dresser drawers wouldn't shut. I didn't feel like moving to yet another room with unforeseen issues so I just dealt with it. This place is old AF so the walls are paper thin and drunk people were screaming from 2-4am every night. Stay here if you don't want to go to a hostel and can't afford anything else in a good location but bring earplugs. Otherwise avoid completely.,The location is ideal and this boutique hotel is cheaper than most other central Boston hotels. The waitstaff was friendly and helpful.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Jessica,Canada,18 Reviews,December 19  2016,8.8,Wifi wasn't the best.,Room was comfortable. pretty standard. Comfortable bed. linen was clean. Excellent shower. hot water and great pressure. TV had a lot of channels. Quiet location. Boston Common 10 minute walk.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,4 Reviews,December 16  2016,4.6,So overpriced it was mind-blowing. Other than the decency of the location you get so little for your money. The rooms are small and old. the adjacent restaurant is also expensive. and there are very few amenities. I paid $275 a night for this underwhelming place. Read that again and try your best to avoid it.,Location was decent
Chandler Inn Hotel,Jonathan,United States of America,11 Reviews,December 12  2016,7.5,The bathroom is a bit cramped. with no counter space and the walls are a bit thin.  There is also no iron in the room. so I had to call and ask for one to be delivered.,Location was great. also bar/restaurant on site that's open pretty late.  Rooms are decorated nicely. with most standard amenities.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Amyneumy,Australia,3 Reviews,December 10  2016,6.7,The room was always too hot I had to open my window as I could not get the air conditioner to change from heat to cool as it always came out hot. Also when the air conditioner was turned off it still made such a loud and annoying noise.,Location is good for walking to back bay station and only took 10 minutes to walk to the old trolley tours stop.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Dylan,United States of America,1 review,December 9  2016,5.4,There were long black hairs on my pillows when I first arrived (my hair is short and brown). The WiFi is essentially nonexistent. and there is poor cell reception in the building as well. My TV wasn't working and the staff gave me instructions to fix it that took about 35 minutes and seemed quite annoyed that I had called.  I couldn't control the temperature of my room and roasted in an arid 90 degrees. I would only ever stay here again as a last resort.,The location is decent and the shower is fine.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Stephen,United States of America,1 review,December 8  2016,2.9,Unfriendly. Dirty bathroom. cable didn't work. bedding was tread-bare.  Odor in hallways.  this is not a European-Style guest house. its more of a run down hostel -Beware.,Checking out
Chandler Inn Hotel,Håkan,Sweden,28 Reviews,December 6  2016,8.3,Complicated and unreliable tv-system but the personell were very helpful,The hotel is connected to a local pub where you can enjoy a drink.

Chandler Inn Hotel,Kent,,1 review,December 3  2016,9.2,N/A,Good vibe in a cool neighbourhood. Convenient. Great pub in the hotel. Wifi is much better (stability + speed) than most hotel connections I experienced.
Chandler Inn Hotel,Anonymous,Philippines,11 Reviews,November 24  2016,6.7,The staffed said "system" was down and handed us keys to a room where someone was already staying in. When we were reassigned to another room. the wifi didn't work.,Location

Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 23  2017,9.6,The amenities and fixtures are a bit dated. Some of the furniture was on its last leg.

Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Denise,United States of America,4 Reviews,October 18  2017,7.1,The pin code on the lock did not work.  Had to call to get the correct code.  Once in the building. the door to the apartment was open but we were never able to lock the door when we left because the keys never worked.,Great location!
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Three,Canada,2 Reviews,October 16  2017,5.8,Carpets were dirty. windows and balcony door difficult or impossible to open and close. Maintenance did respond on the windows.Biggest issue: we arrived in Boston early morning and could not check in until 4 PM. The host company made arrangements for us to drop off our cases at another property some distance away and pick them up later. This was a big hassle for three weary travelers coming off an overnight flight. and involved extra taxi rides and a visit to their cleaning crew HQ (or that is what it appeared to be).  Similarly. on check out we had a late flight and could only stay at the unit for one additional hour free of charge. again with no facility for storing baggage. which is all we needed. Luckily. a major hotel just around the corner was able to accommodate our needs on this. Phone did not work. Toaster temperamental. Two bedrooms. one bathroom with cheater ensuite (so two toilets). One hairdryer fixed to the wall in cheater ensuite. so all of had to use that one.The unit has the feel of a timeshare sub-rental. We had to strip our beds and take the garbage down to the garage. If we had not had to pay the full amount upfront in advance. we would have canceled and moved to a different property. For the time we were there it provided a comfortable base. although the price we paid was definitely too high for what we received. There was no "luxury" in Global Luxury Suites.,Beds were comfy. location was excellent.
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Edward,United States of America,4 Reviews,October 16  2017,10,I think more strategically placed outlets and USB chargers would be helpful.,I traveled for a business trip with two other colleagues. We took three rooms with global luxury suites. two in Back Bay and one in Kenmore Square. I must say we were most impressed with the service received. All three rooms were immaculate. The furnishings were modern and up to date. the linens luxurious and the gift packs of toiletries and kitchen goods were a nice added touch.The building concierge. although not on Global Luxury Suites' staff were courteous and helpful. They gave me directions to my meeting and even called a taxi for me. Check in was a breeze. The water pressure in the shower was really powerful. (Which is a real game changer for me.)I do a lot of business traveling with short stop overs. I will definitely be checking out other locations with Global Luxury Suites.
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Dr,United States of America,4 Reviews,October 16  2017,10,N/A,Very clean and comfortable. Everything was as expected. Concierge was helpful and accommodating. Everything was provided as described. I will definitely book again at global luxury suites.Fred
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Aidan,Ireland,1 review,October 12  2017,2.5,I never write reviews: I paid for a service to sleep inside a safe apartment instead it's outside on a corridor and absolute no security for my valuablesWe had to slept on a corridor outside the room - Global Luxury Suites were informed and the typical ignorance of no reply or action is just unreal - it's beyond a disgrace and Booking.com should investigate their connection to their siteNever again will I use this company - in the strongest of terms - never. never book an apartment with this company God forbid a child. family. or elderly person was put in this position.,Would like to write some positives but just can't - won't ever use this organisation again - an absolute disgrace and something I feel strongly enough to follow up with legal action.Look at the pictures I've put up. to give a small sense of the issue.Spent a fortune and had to sleep outside the room &amp; for half my stay the door was open as the lock was broken.  Sleepless night on a corridor and no security for valuables for remainder of stay.No support and all emails / phones calls ignored after checkout - I've given 3 weeks since leaving the apartment for a remedy and nothing
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,T,Canada,1 review,October 10  2017,6.3,Communication from Global Luxury Suites was very limited. Information provided was there was on site parking that simply required a ticket from a machine. This proved to wrong. I only found out the night before our arrival. after I asked for a third time. that I was required to arrange parking through the property management and that they only took money orders. When I called the property I was unable to get anyone to answer. Luckily I got one person at Global Luxury Suites who was good enough to follow up and get us a spot. The building itself was very noisy. There was a party each night on our floor that went until 2 am. and the people beside us had small children who began screaming at 7:00 am. On our last day the people beside us were moving out. The movers slammed doors every couple of minutes and yelled back in forth. This was also early in the morning. It is a beautiful building but I am not sure I would go back.,The property was clean and had excellent amenities. It is in a good location in the city for walking.close to everything.
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Kevin,Australia,1 review,September 24  2017,5.4,The beds. They where the most uncomfortable beds I've slept in. There should be local information. like a map or what's around the area. where to eat etc.,N/A

Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,mcfm,United States of America,3 Reviews,March 13  2017,8.5,Finding a place to park was difficult.The complimentary coffee. soap. etc. wasn't replaced. So this stuff is only good for one day. If you stay more than one day. bring your own stuff.There were three of us. One bed in each bedroom. And a futon in the living room. There are extra sheets. but no extra blankets. So only two of us were able to sleep under a nice. warm blanket. The third person got to shiver all night.I never saw any staff the entire time I was there.,It's an adequate apartment for 2 people (in separate beds) in a decent location.
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Kathy,United States of America,1 review,February 25  2017,10,N/A,Absolutely beautiful apartment in gated apartment complex with lovely courtyard and great views.  Within walking distance to everything--we will definitely go back!
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Anonymous,United States of America,27 Reviews,January 15  2017,5.8,No pots and pans. fireplace not cleaned of old ashes. and worst of all. the TV. DVD and more were all disconnected and couldn't be connected by us because they needed a power strip. We complained and it took 5 days to get the company to send the appropriate technician. meanwhile giving us simplistic suggestions we had already tried and told them so. and sent "inspectors" who were nice but didn't have the power strip or the technical knowledge to let us have TV or play DVDs.At the outrageous price of the rental. this is unforgivable. But I did force them into a small. very small rebate; you have to ask for the manager and not any of the simplistic folks who answer the phone.Also..(my fault too for reading too quickly). the minute you make the reservation on Booking.com. you cannot cancel without paying the entire rental fee for the entire time you booked. Plus. if you check in even a couple of hours early. they charge.,The location can't be beat. and the set up of the apartment was excellent. The concierge. who doesn't serve Booking.com tenants. only long term tenants or owners. was pleasant. He told us of the huge wonderful supermarket. Star Market. one block away so we could save money by making our own breakfast etc. And the Prudential Center one block way has all the restaurants (including the new Eataly) and shops you might like.
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Nora,Canada,1 review,January 10  2017,2.5,Horrible service. Not clean. Apartment smelt like burnt plastic so we had to sleep with the windows open in freezing weather. Very little furniture and the beds were really poor quality.,Good location

Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Hyung,United States of America,1 review,November 4  2016,2.5,Absolutely terrible customer service. Found a live bug that we suspectedto be a bed bug. When we called customer service to request an inspectorto confirm. no one was able or willing to take care of the issue. Calledmore than 8 times in the span of a month to figure out whether this wasconfirmed to be a bed bug issue but not a single call was returned. Whenwe requested to speak to a manager. it seemed the manager was neveractually in office and asked me constantly to call them back at anothertime. As someone who has been on copious business trips in the past.this place had by far the worst customer service. I would not recommendit to anyone regardless of the price. While it is true the bug wediscovered may not have been an actual bed bug. this was never confirmedby the management. All I do know is that. from what I was told. the sameplace where we had this issue was rented out to other people when thisproblem has not been investigated in the proper manner. It'sunfortunate there's no figuring out whether people who rented theplace after us had same issue and the company is taking the same stolid.irresponsible attitude towards poor customers.,Fast &amp; free internet only.
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Scott,United States of America,1 review,October 10  2016,7.5,The furniture is a bit worn and there is a community dog area that was right below our window so be prepared for barking in the morning before people go to work and early evening.,The location was great. close to all.The kitchen was upgraded and the floors were new and nice. Close to all transportation and sites. Easy to get around. The place is very safe and secured.
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Anna,United Kingdom,16 Reviews,September 27  2016,4.6,After a long flight we arrived to find that we should have been sent a code to retrieve our keys - after 12 attempts to phone the 'concierge' after constantly getting cut off. we were given the code. but not the room number.  A further 45 mins and endless cut off calls before we finally got in - to find the beds not made up as we asked. parking had not been arranged as requested. no cutlery in kitchen ... I could go on!,Comfortable apartment in a nice block
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,George,United Kingdom,14 Reviews,August 13  2016,8.8,Perhaps a map of the exact position of the apartment in the complex would have been useful. along with the waste bin location. But found all eventually.,Very clean and comfortable. Staff great in storing late departure luggage.
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Arif,Turkey,1 review,August 11  2016,3.3,Terrible company. They have no idea what is going on. The apartment was not as promised. when i told them they returned to me in 7 days and said that they are sory and offered me 100 usd discount for a 16 night stay.In one of the rooms the ac was not working properly they send someone to fix in 4 days and the guy said he has been working there for 15 years and never been fixed and said that in order to fix we gad to evacuate the building. I can count many other dissapointments with photos. I dont recomend this place to anybody and i am a very easygoing and understanfing character.,N/A
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Irene,Singapore,26 Reviews,August 7  2016,8.3,It was difficult to locate the unit. We had to check through many entrances before finding the right one.No parking facilities and it was hard to find any on the street in the middle of the night when we arrived. luckily we found public parking in the Prudential Plaza Mall not too far away.,The apartment itself was lovely. And the welcome pack with all necessities like kitchen towels. dishwasher detergents. even shoe flannel. etc was thoughtful and very well received.
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Jennifer,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 23  2016,4.6,Running toilet... Had to shut off water in between usesNot much seating in living room; not very comfortable overall. Master bedroom... Over sized furniture makes it a pain to get to the bathroom.Lacking kitchen utensils and not even a cookie sheet or pizza pan to cook in the oven.,The amount of space was nice. Air conditioning worked well. Loved the building and courtyard.
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Anonymous,United Kingdom,38 Reviews,June 21  2016,5.0,To call this property luxury is stretching it greatly. It was tired and past it and the furniture was uncomfortable. especially the sofa bed.,The apartment was clean
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Amy,United States of America,1 review,June 16  2016,6.3,The beds were terribly uncomfortable. very firm/cheap mattresses and scratchy sheets. The living room furniture was also cheap.,The location was great and the space was comfortable.
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Ian,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,June 16  2016,9.6,The TV in the living room did not work and it took two days to replace it. The staff were very apologetic and kept us well informed of progress. And we had TVs in the bedrooms anyway.,Spacious. modern apartment with all facilities in an excellent area of Boston. Good transport. restaurants and shops close by.
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Lára,Iceland,1 review,May 29  2016,6.7,The service. lightbulbs were broken in one of the rooms. we were 5 people and the apartment only had 3 coffee cups. it took a long time to fix and they only fixed one lightbin the room and not the other and we stayed for 5 nights,Beautiful apartment with a balcony. enough space for 5 people. short walk to the main shooping area in Boston

Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Russ,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 25  2016,7.5,Paying $40 a night to park our car in their garage when we could have gone a block or two for half that price. The bedroom tv. wifi and dishwasher didn't work. This was a very expensive apt and everything should have worked.,Location was in walking distance of several sights and restaurants we wanted to try. We felt very safe in the area.
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Brian,Australia,27 Reviews,May 17  2016,7.5,The old and damaged plastic vertical drapes rattle all night with the AC blowing on them.  They also do not block out the several street lights outside the bedroom window.  Suggest that the owners replace these with drapes. blackout preferably. especially in the bedroom.Advice as to the actual apartment number and key return information would have been helpful.,Property well located in Central Boston.  If you are traveling with a vehicle there are several Parking Buildings in close proximity with cheaper rates than offered by Global.  Good restaurants and shopping nearby as well as the Metro and Tour operators.
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Michael,Ireland,3 Reviews,May 12  2016,9.5,There is no face to face receptionist so have all your phone numbers and contact details in case you need help.,2 very large comfortable bedrooms at each end of a large sittingroom/dining room and kitchen. Great if you're sharing with friends as the bedrooms are far apart. 1 shower room with 2 connecting bathrooms. Lots of toiletries and everything in the kitchen to get you started. Storage everywhere!! Coffee machine in the reception area.
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Cristian,Italy,7 Reviews,April 30  2016,4.6,the check-in procedure was a DISASTER. for information but also the confusion to find the place. There were works in the apartment making it impossibile to access the place and having to go through a back door with many stairs and in trouble when carrying (as I did) heavy luggage. No one there to help as well as many of the electric plugs were old. some partly pulled out the wall.,the flat was spacious and well equipped
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Kyle,United States of America,1 review,April 26  2016,9.2,The check-in procedure was a bit confusing but once explained not bad at all.,Excellent location. Clean and comfortable room. The day concierge was very helpful and friendly.
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Sirivong,Thailand,12 Reviews,April 16  2016,5.8,During our stay for 3 nights. the hot water system didn't work for 2 days and the weather is -3 degree celcius. also snow in Boston. For the first day we informed management and got fixed. Unfortunately. happened again on the last day that we had to check out. We had to boil water from kitchen and mix it to shower. imagine that 3 persons had to do that. it's kind of chaotic. We called management and they said will send someone to fix but we have to leave the apartment by 11Am the check out time. No flexibility from them as I requested for. This is unacceptable. We made a complaint and they said they will compensate 10% of its rental. This should be in the total amount plus tax and cleaning fee not only the rent. And worse they called me back around 4 pm. said that the maid told them that we still in the apartment but we left since 11am. This is another unacceptable treatment. Now. i am waiting for their compensation which will refund to my credit card.,The location is superb. Close to Prudential mall . very convenient. The compound is nice and quiet. The apartment i stayed is good but HOT WATER didn't work for 2days!
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Thomas,United States of America,1 review,April 11  2016,3.8,The place was filthy. stained rugs. hair on towels. blinds missing in living room. bed was like sleeping in a hammock. the hall has never been vacuumed in months. mold in the shower. a toxic smell in hall and apartment. the furniture and décor were outdated and no where like the on line pictures. and management never returned my phone calls about my complaint. I checked out 1 day early because of our problems and 5 phone calls later. I was told I would not get a full refund for the last day. This appears to be a sham operation without management onsite or available to discuss problems. I would never recommend this global luxury suites to anyone.,location good.
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Gregory,United States of America,4 Reviews,April 3  2016,3.8,Check-in was difficult.  The number on the key is a different apartment number than the actual number of the apartment. which is. frankly. simply confusing.  We stood outside another apartment trying to get into the wrong unit.Parking was a disaster:  We had confirmed via email that we had reserved parking. and the Global staff said - via email - that there would be a parking pass and parking instructions in the apartment.  There were not.  We telephoned to find out where the parking info was.  They said that they do not handle parking.  I reminded them that they confirmed our parking via email. I had the email. and read it to the representative. They said they'd have to send it over to another department and hopefully get it sorted out and get back to us "sometime today."  I told them that was unacceptable. as my husband and daughter (asleep in the car) couldn't even come into the apartment until we had a place to park.  They told me to go to the concierge and he would sort it out.  The concierge had no info about our parking.  After going around about it for a couple of hours. the concierge finally just gave us a spot.  Although our red-eye flight didn't arrive until Monday morning. I had booked the room for Sunday night so that we would be able to sleep immediately upon arrival.  However the parking debacle didn't get resolved until well after noon. making the full extra night that we paid for virtually useless.  Global should have compensated us for that wasted time - I asked the phone representative to put me through to a manager. and she refused. saying that I could only send an email.  Evidently. the supervisory staff (if it exists) will not communicate directly with customers.  That is absolutely unacceptable.In addition to the check-in fiasco there were a few minor as well as two SIGNIFICANT issues:1) Minor issues:  the pull out bed in the front room had not been cleaned.,The apartment itself was fine - theoretically a good space for a family of four.  Two bathrooms was a nice perk.  Washer/dryer was useful (or. more accurately. would have been. had the dryer not made an awful screeching sound. which must have been audible in surrounding apartments - unreal).  The location is very good.  Nice baskets of amenities in bathrooms and kitchens.
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Stephen,Canada,2 Reviews,March 22  2016,8.8,there wasn't enough cutlery or dishes . the suite only had 2 glasses . 2 knives. etc. if you have a 3rd party or a guest visiting for lunch or dinner you'd have to go out and buy extra dishes . you'd better not mind the sound of barking dogs because there is an urban dog park right behind the unit . I happen to love dogs so it didn't bother me . also the T line runs basically right under the building so you hear the rumble of that about every 5 - 10 minutes . not super loud but you definately hear it,I liked the location with a major grocery only 2blocks away . the suite was comfortable and clean . having an on site consiare was a plus
Global Luxury Suites at Back Bay,Cynthia,United States of America,11 Reviews,March 16  2016,5.8,very disappointed that we booked a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apt in back bay.

Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Brian,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,November 2  2017,6.3,After paying $200 plus for a room it was a bit much asking an extra $7 or so for wifi. Cheeky greedy beggars!!!! Even the meanest motel we stayed in offered free wifi.,Next to airport.

Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 31  2017,6.3,Over-priced for value.

Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Marion,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 28  2017,7.0,Found the nightly room rate expensive but I suspect its indicative of the high costs of hotel accommodation in the Boston area. There was nothing wrong with the hotel. the staff or the facilities.,Room was comfortable and had a good range of amenities (tea/coffee; full range of toiletries. etc). Only stayed for one night as we were flying to our next destination the following morning so didnt make use of the gym/pool or have breakfast.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,William,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 25  2017,9.2,N/A,Traffic in and put of Boston Logan is always congested. so allow some time.

Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Amy,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 21  2017,6.3,I was a Hilton Honors member and my second visit the front desk clerk couldn't find my account and wasn't very accommodating and I never was able to access the wifi.  Our bathroom shower plug didn't work - so you had to pull the entire plug out for the water to drain.  And some of the hand towels had makeup stains on them.  I could live with both of these issues but at over $350 a night - was not pleased.,The bed at the Hilton is the greatest!  The location cannot be beat.  Shuttle drivers were great!

Will never stay at this hotel again.,Not much
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Dig,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,October 14  2017,6.3,Booking com quoted $310. When I arrived I was told at reception it was $404. I think that’s an unacceptably large difference. Receptionist was grumpy. I was the one who’d just flown the Atlantic!,Convenient. Bed comfy.

Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Susan,United States of America,4 Reviews,October 9  2017,4.6,I arrived early and was required to pay an additional $25 for early check in. Since room service ends at 12 a.m.. and I didn't return from a ball game until 12:04. I ran to the bar to get some dinner. The food was not worth the price. I can buy a bottle of wine for the price of that one glass. and I got to eat with plastic utensils. The clam chowder was a gluey mass of flavorless. lumpy goo. My room smelled pretty bad. like no one had used it for months. After leaving the fan on all day while I went out. it was much better. Would not recommend staying here unless there is absolutely nothing else available in the city.,The shuttle bus to the airport and train station were the high points. Tried to like it. but couldn't.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Linda,United States of America,10 Reviews,October 8  2017,4.6,Charging for the internet in an over $300 room is ridiculous.  There were very few toiletries and they were not quality.  There were not enough plugs in the room.  The room was tired and worn. The front desk clerk was rude to my friend who arrived before me.  This was not a pleasant experience and I cancelled my return booking. However Dante was very helpful.,The pillow and bed were comfortable.  Plenty of hot water.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 7  2017,7.5,They overcharged my account as of today my account still has not been corrected. More importantly. they are saying they don't owe me the $149 they charge for incidental fee of $50 per night. I have spoken with five different representatives from the hotel three different times. The first representative told me it will automatically fall off and credited back to my account. I have inquired additional fees due to this issue. I will advise future guess to pay close attention to your account and invoice. They didn't inform me about the incidental fee although I booked via (Booking.com) and paid at the time of check-in. They had two large authorization and one processed payment somehow the $149 was lost in transmittal/ processing. I am asking for a full investigations on deceptive practices.,Location
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 7  2017,3.8,Not convenient from terminal C... a 25 minute. poorly-signed walk through very strange areas of the airport. Walls were paper thin... any conversation in the hallway or the room next door we're easily heard in our room. and the plumbing sounds when he room next door used the toilet or shower were very. very loud. Truly no frills... $28 extra for breakfast. $7 for wifi. even local calls were a $1/minute. For $380. I expected much more.,Check-in at midnight was easy.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Jane,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 7  2017,9.2,N/A,The staff was so helpful.  I realized at breakfast in the hotel coffee shop that while at dinner in the hotel the night before I had left my credit card on the table with the signed bill.  The waitress immediately checked with the front desk and determined that they had it in the safe.  Every member of the staff was very professional and friendly.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Lb,United States of America,9 Reviews,October 7  2017,5.0,Service wasn't great and neither was the property. It's fine. It served it's purpose. but I wouldn't stay here again.  Checked in at midnight but it took an hour to get a rollaway bed and I had to call to find out where it was. The room wasn't that clean. The carpets were filthy throughout the hotel. It needs a major refresher. It's connected to the airport. but for most flights you still need to take a shuttle.,--
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Anonymous,United States of America,16 Reviews,October 5  2017,10,Breakfast price was way too high: clearly set for a "captive audience ". $50 for two with tip-just pancakes. French toast. coffee/tea. Buffet $27.00!,Very convenient to terminal at airport

Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Andre,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 29  2017,6.7,The price. 390USD for a night in a single room at an airport is an absolute rip-off and a good example of a hotels take advantage of stranded passengers. which was my case. Yes. the hotel is in good condition and good location (if by chance you need a hotel there). but the price is nowhere close to being justifiable! Stay away from this place unless you want to waste your money or that of your company!!,Close to the airport. pretty much the only hotel close to Logan
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Amanda,Bermuda,4 Reviews,September 28  2017,7.5,The fact that you don't have movies on demand.

The view over the river on a sunny morning: unexpected and exceptional!
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Christopher,United States of America,1 review,September 27  2017,8.8,N/A,Waitress from Yugoslavia in the formal breakfast room was the best. Attentive. quick to correct an minor error in the kitchen; delightful. Person who waited on my partner at the outside coffee/snack bar around 2:30pm was rude.

Hilton Boston Logan Airport,John,Canada,8 Reviews,September 14  2017,7.9,see above,Location! Location! Location! Other than that the hotel was very 'standard' vis-à-vis dozens of other hotels I have stayed in.  Perfunctory service. I am a member of the Hilton Club and received points. but you may want to consider some extra 'incentive' - perhaps a free drink at the bar or a fruit basket. or something that says - 'we recognize you as a MEMBER guest'.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Julie,United States of America,1 review,September 10  2017,5.8,There wasn't a refrigerator. no microwave. and no free breakfast.

I am a retired military veteran. and when I brought this up. hopefully for some kind of break on parking. or at least some breakfast vouchers. the staff just rolled their eyes and said that they don't have military discounts.,We had an amazing room with a view of the city skyline and harbor.  The shuttle service was very convenient. just a phone call away so we could get picked up from the train station.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Anonymous,United States of America,9 Reviews,September 6  2017,4.2,rude staff...cold. awful snacks and had to buy wine at $16 per glass ....in the very noisy restaurant downstairs wine cost was $6.50,business class lounge terrible and not worth the cost in any way...four hotels we booked on this trip were not as booking.com represented them and I have great doubts we'll book with you again.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Ellen,United States of America,16 Reviews,September 1  2017,6.3,Being handed a bottle of water at check in when I had all I could do to manage my luggage.Also there was only 1 bar of soap and no shower gel in the bathroom.,Location
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Taken,United States of America,1 review,August 28  2017,6.3,Room service took me for granted as if I had no common sense.I had ordered (1) bottle of wine and (1) order of French Fries. After waiting the hour. we then received a phone call from R/S stating that they were on their way up in just a minute. but the wine we selected was all out.  We selected another bottle and waited.  After waiting approx. 20 more minutes. I called down to find out where they were.  Was told they were on their way up.  When they arrived just a few minutes later. they didn't even have the 2nd bottle that I chose.  Instead. they brought a 3rd one (which we did not choose) and told my wife and I. "We have upgraded your selection but at no additional cost".They must have thought me for a fool. and so I must have been for just "taking it".First. how do you know what type and brands of wine I like/don't like?Second. to bring me a bottle that I DID NOT select...that cost only 1/2 the price of the one I chose but still charge me the same is extremely offensive once I find this out.I understand upcharge and profit margins.  I did not have a problem with the fact that the first two bottles had a profit margin that equated to between 145% to 170% markup from normal off the shelf pricing.  However. when I am told that I have been given a "complimentary upgrade" at no additional cost......only to find out that the wine is only 1/2 the cost of the other 2 I had selected. then that is not only offensive. but extremely deceitful.  Either they were out of the 2nd wine I chose as well. or the impression it gives is that the hotel is trying to boost their profit by providing a cheaper. less valued. lower standards wine out while charging the same price as a more desirable and expensive wine.Did we object or refuse?  No...we didn't.  it had been a long day after attending a funeral of a fellow Marine and we were tired both emotionally and physically.,Thermostat worked properly to keep the room cool.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Patrick,Singapore,26 Reviews,August 27  2017,8.8,N/A,Perfect location for catching our early flight in the morning. Easy to get into the city centre if you have time. You can see the planes taking off and landing but you can't hear them.Great if you have an over night layover.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Gavtodd,United Kingdom,1 review,August 27  2017,6.7,When we arrived it took 45 minutes to find our booking. despite showing them the booking.com receipt. Staff at the front desk were generally rude. The cleaning staff barged in at 9:00 am to clean the room and we were still asleep. Need to remember to pop out the do not disturb sign I guess!,Bed and room were great. Slept very well. nice and quiet.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Emily,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 24  2017,8.3,I thought you could walk to the terminals from the hotel based on other reviews I read. but that's not the case for all terminals. We had to take the shuttle for our united flight unfortunately.,The location at the airport was excellent for our early morning flight. They also had a crib they brought up for our baby which was very helpful! Overall. it was a perfectly fine. no frills hotel for a quick stay.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Eric,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 21  2017,7.1,The Hilton airport shuttle was very crowded and a bit chaotic early in the morning. I walked to the hotel from my arrival gate in Terminal B. but the path through the garages and sky bridges wasn't very well marked - could use better signage.,Clean and quiet. Pub food pretty good and deli/coffee bar in lobby well stocked.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Patricia,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,August 21  2017,8.8,We thought the price was excessive at £350 per night with no breakfast. Will avoid arriving so late to the destination in future as we didn't feel we could take full advantage of the hotel facilities. However. we enjoyed a fabulous swim in the morning. We were the only ones at the pool which made it special.,It was really convenient as we arrived quite late in the evening so it was great to walk to the hotel via the sky walk. Directions through the car park could have been clearer.Comfortable room. clean. quiet and had a great sleep before going on our American adventure.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Glenn,United States of America,10 Reviews,August 17  2017,9.6,Restaurant was having some kind of problem. took over a half hour to get an order of scrambled eggs and a yogurt off the menu.

Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 7  2017,9.6,It was much more expensive than I would have like to pay,The hotel is great because it is within Boston Logan airport. We had a 5:30AM flight. so we returned the rental car the evening before our flight. this hotel shuttle picked us up from the rental return and then the next morning at 3:30AM delivered us to our airlines. How easy could it be!
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Mike,Cyprus,49 Reviews,August 6  2017,3.8,Old hotel that needs renovation. We found hair in bathtub and in the toilet.The bed was really comfortable though.For $100 would be ok but for $350 just crazy.,It is located within the airport.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Angie_bd,United States of America,1 review,August 4  2017,7.9,It is rather expensive. so at least regular wifi could be included into the room price. I was charged an extra $7 for a few minutes online. $30 for a breakfast is also too much. Sure enough. we did not eat there. Like many other guests I believe. Also. I booked under a special offer of $250 - and it transferred into $295 with 3 (!) types of taxes plus extra fees! Guys. you charge $300 for a regular room - why not include at least free WiFi into this price???,Very close to the airport. When you arrive late no need to mess with a rental car - just walk there. The signs should be better positioned in the terminals though. Some tips how to walk from the terminals to the hotel would be helpful on the hotel page as well.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Christopher,United States of America,1 review,August 2  2017,7.5,Price was steep for a breakfast buffet. With tax. it was around $34.,Good buffet.

Hilton Boston Logan Airport,vicky35,France,17 Reviews,July 7  2017,5.8,Considering the price paid for a room. parking could have been included. The restaurant was terrible.

Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Kelly,United Kingdom,23 Reviews,June 19  2017,7.5,Don't try to find your own way to the hotel from the airport. unless you've landed in Terminal E. The hotel is quite right to recommend that you call their shuttle service. so even if you do fancy a walk after many hours sat in your aeroplane seat. don't be tempted. Call the shuttle!,The room was comfortable and check in/out was very easy.Very close to Terminal E (Delta). I woke up at 3.30am for an early flight and was checked in by 4am.

The refrigerator selves were not set up properly and we left a note so the next guests wouldn't damage anything before it was fixed.,The place was brand new! It was beautiful! The beds were comfortable and having the washer and dryer in the apartment helped so much since we are traveling for 15 days with three kids. It had everything!

Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Marion,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 28  2017,7.0,Found the nightly room rate expensive but I suspect its indicative of the high costs of hotel accommodation in the Boston area. There was nothing wrong with the hotel. the staff or the facilities.,Room was comfortable and had a good range of amenities (tea/coffee; full range of toiletries. etc). Only stayed for one night as we were flying to our next destination the following morning so didnt make use of the gym/pool or have breakfast.

Our bathroom shower plug didn't work - so you had to pull the entire plug out for the water to drain.  And some of the hand towels had makeup stains on them.  I could live with both of these issues but at over $350 a night - was not pleased.,The bed at the Hilton is the greatest!  The location cannot be beat.  Shuttle drivers were great!

Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Susan,United States of America,4 Reviews,October 9  2017,4.6,I arrived early and was required to pay an additional $25 for early check in. Since room service ends at 12 a.m.. and I didn't return from a ball game until 12:04. I ran to the bar to get some dinner. The food was not worth the price. I can buy a bottle of wine for the price of that one glass. and I got to eat with plastic utensils. The clam chowder was a gluey mass of flavorless. lumpy goo. My room smelled pretty bad. like no one had used it for months. After leaving the fan on all day while I went out. it was much better. Would not recommend staying here unless there is absolutely nothing else available in the city.,The shuttle bus to the airport and train station were the high points. Tried to like it. but couldn't.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Linda,United States of America,10 Reviews,October 8  2017,4.6,Charging for the internet in an over $300 room is ridiculous.

This was not a pleasant experience and I cancelled my return booking. However Dante was very helpful.,The pillow and bed were comfortable.  Plenty of hot water.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 7  2017,7.5,They overcharged my account as of today my account still has not been corrected.

The first representative told me it will automatically fall off and credited back to my account. I have inquired additional fees due to this issue. I will advise future guess to pay close attention to your account and invoice. They didn't inform me about the incidental fee although I booked via (Booking.com) and paid at the time of check-in. They had two large authorization and one processed payment somehow the $149 was lost in transmittal/ processing. I am asking for a full investigations on deceptive practices.,Location
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 7  2017,3.8,Not convenient from terminal C... a 25 minute. poorly-signed walk through very strange areas of the airport. Walls were paper thin... any conversation in the hallway or the room next door we're easily heard in our room. and the plumbing sounds when he room next door used the toilet or shower were very. very loud. Truly no frills... $28 extra for breakfast. $7 for wifi. even local calls were a $1/minute. For $380. I expected much more.,Check-in at midnight was easy.

Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Lb,United States of America,9 Reviews,October 7  2017,5.0,Service wasn't great and neither was the property. It's fine. It served it's purpose. but I wouldn't stay here again.  Checked in at midnight but it took an hour to get a rollaway bed and I had to call to find out where it was. The room wasn't that clean. The carpets were filthy throughout the hotel. It needs a major refresher. It's connected to the airport. but for most flights you still need to take a shuttle.,--

Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Andre,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 29  2017,6.7,The price. 390USD for a night in a single room at an airport is an absolute rip-off and a good example of a hotels take advantage of stranded passengers. which was my case. Yes. the hotel is in good condition and good location (if by chance you need a hotel there). but the price is nowhere close to being justifiable! Stay away from this place unless you want to waste your money or that of your company!!,Close to the airport. pretty much the only hotel close to Logan
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Amanda,Bermuda,4 Reviews,September 28  2017,7.5,The fact that you don't have movies on demand.

Pub was only food option. mediocre and over priced.,Best thing about the stay was the airport shuttle and the very accommodating drivers.  Worth it for that reason.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,James,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 22  2017,4.2,Parking expensive $45.00 a day and no alternative. Not even coffee was included. Seems trivial but toilet seat was broken. Staff at desk unfriendly made you feel like a pain.,Location
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Anonymous,New Zealand,39 Reviews,September 17  2017,8.3,The bathroom was a bit small. We felt that the price of the room the bathroom needed to be bigger and maybe a few thing's like cosmetics cleansers would have been nice,The lovely cosy bed and the breakfasts.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,John,Canada,8 Reviews,September 14  2017,7.9,see above,Location! Location! Location! Other than that the hotel was very 'standard' vis-à-vis dozens of other hotels I have stayed in.  Perfunctory service. I am a member of the Hilton Club and received points. but you may want to consider some extra 'incentive' - perhaps a free drink at the bar or a fruit basket. or something that says - 'we recognize you as a MEMBER guest'.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Julie,United States of America,1 review,September 10  2017,5.8,There wasn't a refrigerator. no microwave. and no free breakfast. During the search. we asked for free parking which brought up this hotel.  When we got there. parking was $42.00 a night.  Ouch.  Plus. I am a retired military veteran. and when I brought this up. hopefully for some kind of break on parking. or at least some breakfast vouchers. the staff just rolled their eyes and said that they don't have military discounts.,We had an amazing room with a view of the city skyline and harbor.  The shuttle service was very convenient. just a phone call away so we could get picked up from the train station.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Anonymous,United States of America,9 Reviews,September 6  2017,4.2,rude staff...cold. awful snacks and had to buy wine at $16 per glass ....in the very noisy restaurant downstairs wine cost was $6.50,business class lounge terrible and not worth the cost in any way...four hotels we booked on this trip were not as booking.com represented them and I have great doubts we'll book with you again.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Ellen,United States of America,16 Reviews,September 1  2017,6.3,Being handed a bottle of water at check in when I had all I could do to manage my luggage.Also there was only 1 bar of soap and no shower gel in the bathroom.,Location
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Taken,United States of America,1 review,August 28  2017,6.3,Room service took me for granted as if I had no common sense.I had ordered (1) bottle of wine and (1) order of French Fries. After waiting the hour. we then received a phone call from R/S stating that they were on their way up in just a minute. but the wine we selected was all out.  We selected another bottle and waited.  After waiting approx. 20 more minutes. I called down to find out where they were.  Was told they were on their way up.  When they arrived just a few minutes later. they didn't even have the 2nd bottle that I chose.  Instead. they brought a 3rd one (which we did not choose) and told my wife and I. "We have upgraded your selection but at no additional cost".They must have thought me for a fool. and so I must have been for just "taking it".First. how do you know what type and brands of wine I like/don't like?Second. to bring me a bottle that I DID NOT select...that cost only 1/2 the price of the one I chose but still charge me the same is extremely offensive once I find this out.I understand upcharge and profit margins.  I did not have a problem with the fact that the first two bottles had a profit margin that equated to between 145% to 170% markup from normal off the shelf pricing.  However. when I am told that I have been given a "complimentary upgrade" at no additional cost......only to find out that the wine is only 1/2 the cost of the other 2 I had selected. then that is not only offensive. but extremely deceitful.  Either they were out of the 2nd wine I chose as well. or the impression it gives is that the hotel is trying to boost their profit by providing a cheaper. less valued. lower standards wine out while charging the same price as a more desirable and expensive wine.Did we object or refuse?  No...we didn't.  it had been a long day after attending a funeral of a fellow Marine and we were tired both emotionally and physically.,Thermostat worked properly to keep the room cool.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Patrick,Singapore,26 Reviews,August 27  2017,8.8,N/A,Perfect location for catching our early flight in the morning. Easy to get into the city centre if you have time. You can see the planes taking off and landing but you can't hear them.Great if you have an over night layover.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Gavtodd,United Kingdom,1 review,August 27  2017,6.7,When we arrived it took 45 minutes to find our booking. despite showing them the booking.com receipt. Staff at the front desk were generally rude. The cleaning staff barged in at 9:00 am to clean the room and we were still asleep. Need to remember to pop out the do not disturb sign I guess!,Bed and room were great. Slept very well. nice and quiet.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Emily,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 24  2017,8.3,I thought you could walk to the terminals from the hotel based on other reviews I read. but that's not the case for all terminals. We had to take the shuttle for our united flight unfortunately.,The location at the airport was excellent for our early morning flight. They also had a crib they brought up for our baby which was very helpful! Overall. it was a perfectly fine. no frills hotel for a quick stay.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Eric,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 21  2017,7.1,The Hilton airport shuttle was very crowded and a bit chaotic early in the morning. I walked to the hotel from my arrival gate in Terminal B. but the path through the garages and sky bridges wasn't very well marked - could use better signage.,Clean and quiet. Pub food pretty good and deli/coffee bar in lobby well stocked.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Patricia,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,August 21  2017,8.8,We thought the price was excessive at £350 per night with no breakfast. Will avoid arriving so late to the destination in future as we didn't feel we could take full advantage of the hotel facilities. However. we enjoyed a fabulous swim in the morning. We were the only ones at the pool which made it special.,It was really convenient as we arrived quite late in the evening so it was great to walk to the hotel via the sky walk. Directions through the car park could have been clearer.Comfortable room. clean. quiet and had a great sleep before going on our American adventure.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Glenn,United States of America,10 Reviews,August 17  2017,9.6,Restaurant was having some kind of problem. took over a half hour to get an order of scrambled eggs and a yogurt off the menu.  Manager did comp the meals after I contacted him and complained.  Also. not the hotel's fault but from midnight to about 2 am had noisy guests in the hallway and kids running up and down the hall yelling.,Convenience to airport and T system
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 12  2017,8.3,Our room was dusty.  with cobwebs on the ceiling abovebedside lamp.,Location perfect for early morning flight. Staff friendly. but professional.Good food at in-house restaurant. Quiet.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Fahy Family,United States of America,12 Reviews,August 12  2017,7.5,You have to pay extra for wifi. Seriously.

Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Dale,Australia,3 Reviews,August 8  2017,6.7,I paid $515 AU and still had to pay for wifi. first hotel in the 5 I had stayed in over the last 3 weeks and the most expensive and the connection was poor. No assistance with luggage.,Room service food excellent
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Wesley,United States of America,1 review,August 8  2017,7.1,Had to wait quite a while for the shuttle. so we had to leave plenty of time for travel.Breakfast was ridiculously priced: $20 for two muffins and two drinks.,Very nice to hold our baggage before and after we were there.

Hilton Boston Logan Airport,mclaudiafcunha,Brazil,17 Reviews,August 7  2017,9.2,I just stayed there because I had an early flight. but it is really far from everything in the city and is not so easy to walk around.,Friendly staff. very clean and neat room. with a really good bed and linen.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 7  2017,9.6,It was much more expensive than I would have like to pay,The hotel is great because it is within Boston Logan airport. We had a 5:30AM flight. so we returned the rental car the evening before our flight. this hotel shuttle picked us up from the rental return and then the next morning at 3:30AM delivered us to our airlines. How easy could it be!
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Mike,Cyprus,49 Reviews,August 6  2017,3.8,Old hotel that needs renovation. We found hair in bathtub and in the toilet.The bed was really comfortable though.For $100 would be ok but for $350 just crazy.,It is located within the airport.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Angie_bd,United States of America,1 review,August 4  2017,7.9,It is rather expensive. so at least regular wifi could be included into the room price. I was charged an extra $7 for a few minutes online. $30 for a breakfast is also too much. Sure enough. we did not eat there. Like many other guests I believe. Also. I booked under a special offer of $250 - and it transferred into $295 with 3 (!) types of taxes plus extra fees! Guys. you charge $300 for a regular room - why not include at least free WiFi into this price???,Very close to the airport. When you arrive late no need to mess with a rental car - just walk there. The signs should be better positioned in the terminals though. Some tips how to walk from the terminals to the hotel would be helpful on the hotel page as well.
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Christopher,United States of America,1 review,August 2  2017,7.5,Price was steep for a breakfast buffet. With tax. it was around $34.,Good buffet.

Hilton Boston Logan Airport,vicky35,France,17 Reviews,July 7  2017,5.8,Considering the price paid for a room. parking could have been included. The restaurant was terrible. Poor service (save for MaryLou). restaurant manager was rude but the food was OK but took a long time to arrive at the table.Breakfast was very slow with waiters pretending not to see you and literaly dragging their feet to serve you.,The hotel was just like another airport hotel; big and impersonal.

Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Marina,United States of America,5 Reviews,July 4  2017,5.4,Rooms needed updating. expensive . Hotel not easy to find from other terminals.,Just ok  We were overnighting for our next connection at Logan airport.  Hotel needs updating in rooms but good for overnight at airport.

Convenient and good enough for an overnight stay

Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Gabriele,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,June 26  2017,7.1,The only option in terms of breakfast was an awful cafe in the main hall. On top of the very limited choice and the ridiculous overpricing. the staff was incredibly rude/unhelpful. Definitely below the par with respect to each and evryone of the Hiltons I have stayed at.,Shuttle service
Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Sue,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,June 26  2017,8.3,Could have been given guest password for wifi when I checked in or information should have been in room.A trouser press would have been appreciated.,Easy walk from airport. Clean &amp; comfortable room.

Hilton Boston Logan Airport,Kelly,United Kingdom,23 Reviews,June 19  2017,7.5,Don't try to find your own way to the hotel from the airport. unless you've landed in Terminal E. The hotel is quite right to recommend that you call their shuttle service. so even if you do fancy a walk after many hours sat in your aeroplane seat. don't be tempted. Call the shuttle!,The room was comfortable and check in/out was very easy.Very close to Terminal E (Delta). I woke up at 3.30am for an early flight and was checked in by 4am.

Two-Bedroom on Hamilton Place Apt 402,Ingrid,United States of America,1 review,October 22  2017,9.2,The residents above seem to be running an overnight daycare- lots of movement form 3 am onwards that unfortunately could be heard through the ceilings. Enough to wake you up and keep you awake.  Apparently they are unaware.,The location was excellent. the apartment was exceptionally clean and comfortable.Didn't hear much noise from outside.
Two-Bedroom on Hamilton Place Apt 402,Travellight,Australia,1 review,July 14  2017,7.5,Very noisy. From the sirens all night long. to the noise from neighbouring apartments. You could hear neighbours walking around as well as bathrooms from neighbouring properties. Would not go outside after dark as the neighbourhood was populated by unsavoury characters.,Decor was excellent
Two-Bedroom on Hamilton Place Apt 402,Mark,United States of America,1 review,July 5  2017,9.6,I have never in all my travels had to go through so much to get the code to a place that we had rented! I was told 3 different times that we are all set and still had to send a picture of my drivers licences AND a selfie holding my ID. The refrigerator selves were not set up properly and we left a note so the next guests wouldn't damage anything before it was fixed.,The place was brand new! It was beautiful! The beds were comfortable and having the washer and dryer in the apartment helped so much since we are traveling for 15 days with three kids. It had everything!
Two-Bedroom on Columbia Road Apt 1D,Nour,United States of America,1 review,August 13  2017,7.1,First of all the apartment is located 1st floor.and to get inside the building wasn't easy.The biggest problem is to find a place to park your car.the company sonder.should provide us a parking spot in the building's garage.,The place was in good neighbor.and I like the harbor walk .

Hotel Boston,Eileen,United States of America,1 review,October 31  2017,5.4,The gentleman at the front desk did it know the area to get simple things like toiletries or snacks which really was around the corner. The hotel didn't have amenities like a wine bottle opener.  Breakfast did not have eggs and bacon.,The price was reasonable for parent visiting colleges weekend.It served its purpose a place to spend the night.
Hotel Boston,Maria,United States of America,1 review,October 30  2017,9.2,I was expecting slightly better breakfast (more American style). I was expecting to find fried eggs or omelettes and mini sausages or bacon but the were not included.,amazing room. I enjoyed the fact that it had a comfortable desk. good wifi.  spacious bathroomand a mini kitchen with microwave and small refrigerator. I found really convenient the fact that in the room an iron and an iron board were also included. very thoughtful. A good stay for many days.
Hotel Boston,Mengyi,China,4 Reviews,October 30  2017,9.2,N/A,The staff are very friendly there. and the breakfast is simple but very good to enjoy. Only thing is the distance from downtown. However. it is still easy access with trains and buses. So overall. it is a good place to recommend.
Hotel Boston,Steven,United States of America,1 review,October 22  2017,10,I really enjoyed everything about the property.,Beautiful place in an ideal location. Beautiful rooms. great shower.

Hotel Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 18  2017,5.8,Beds were definitely older and not supportive (knobbly and uneven); it is a MOTEL. not a hotel; door was difficult to close and could've easily been forcibly entered (from the outside. which was the parking lot...); someone upstairs was very loud in the morning. but I don't even think he was yelling; driveway to road transition would damage any low sports car; off the beaten path/hard to navigate (residential area),It was clean and beds well-made with nice linens.It was not $500/night.Bathroom was clean and bath products were quality.
Hotel Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 18  2017,9.6,Zero,I was expecting a better quality breakfast.  We walked through to see the options and chose no to eat there. we ended up going to a restaurant down the street instead.
Hotel Boston,Tncwatts,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 18  2017,2.9,Construction. not clean. staff.,Renovations were being done all around property. I didn't get a good night's sleep nor did I get to sleep in. Workers from construction company were loud and rude &amp; staff from Boston Hotel were very short with us and rude. Hotel looked very makeshift and I would never recommend. Wish I would have known about construction prior to booking. This was a Major waste.
Hotel Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 15  2017,6.7,Air conditioner broke. too hot. Toilet broke and TV didn't work.

Hotel Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 14  2017,6.7,Parking was limited and construction going on locally so the workers were using parking lot. It left no room for people staying at hotel and we had to pay $20 to park there.,Room was comfortable. We were only there for one night so it was suitable.
Hotel Boston,Allison,United States of America,1 review,October 12  2017,7.9,The breakfast options were limited.

This hotel met the needs of my budget. but was still in a convenient 5 minute walk to the T.
Hotel Boston,Steven,United States of America,1 review,October 9  2017,3.8,This "hotel" is a motel that's showing its age despite being somewhat well-maintained. Boston is an expensive market. but I expect more for $250 per night. especially when parking costs $20 extra. The bathroom had been cleaned. but it needed a deeper clean and some updating.,Staff were nice and professional. The place was relatively quiet. Continental breakfast was fine.
Hotel Boston,Leo,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 9  2017,9.6,I was surprised with the unexpected parking fee of $20.00 for the overnight stay. I am not sure booking.com is / was aware of this charge. This may be new so I wish to share this information.,Great breakfast
Hotel Boston,Vanessa,United States of America,4 Reviews,October 6  2017,3.3,The parking lots horrible hill made getting in and out very complicated- especially for a female in heels. Unsafe. Parking on a slant was also unnerving. The bathroom was disgusting- the bath tub was dirty and there were tiles missing from around the tub. And it smelled like urine in there from the moment we walked in. The continental breakfast machines were turned off before 10:30 when we tried to get pancakes/waffles. The tiny pillows were useless and not comfortable whatsoever. There was an awkward blood stain or something on the curtains.,There was a surplus of locks on the doors. the beds were good sized and the air conditioner worked.
Hotel Boston,Ray,United Kingdom,33 Reviews,October 4  2017,6.7,The hotel (motel. actually) was a long way from the centre involving a fairly lengthy ride on the 'T' (approximately 40 minutes) into and out of Boston city centre and the main attractions.,Booked late - this was the best value for money option available when we booked.  A couple of decent restaurants (Thai and Tapas) with five minutes walk of the hotel.
Hotel Boston,Mamie,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 17  2017,9.2,Not much.  I had everything I needed; especially. heat and hot water. which was working great. I'm always cold. Bathroom water pressure could be stronger. J/S.A complimentary US News in the lobby was a nice touch.,King bed was comfy. Room was big and roomy. Good lighting in every corner of the space. All the comforts of home.I was pretty impressed with the breakfast buffet. Fresh fruit compote was excellent. Everything was very fresh and the buffet was kept clean and presentable.. Coffee was somewhat on the weak side. Waffles and pancakes were a good option. too.I did not have any eggs or cereal.

Hotel Boston,Carol,United States of America,1 review,August 23  2017,7.1,For the price. I don't really have any complaints.

It was nice to have off street parking.
Hotel Boston,Kenneth,United States of America,1 review,August 17  2017,6.3,I didn't like that I had to pay to stay on the property. breakfast was not very good at all. and the cost for the stay could have been cheaper.,I liked that the hotel was close to Boston College.
Hotel Boston,Eric,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 14  2017,3.8,Carpet was dirty.  My socks we Brown after walking around inside the room. Bathrooms are very small and tight. Water only trickled out of the shower head.,Location to our students off campus housing.
Hotel Boston,Anna,United States of America,1 review,August 14  2017,8.3,The temperature was hard to control. We kept having to get up to adjust the air conditioner because it would automatically reset to 85 degrees every couple of hours. We also didn't like that parking was an additional fee. There were plenty of spaces in their private lot. One space per room should be included with your rental.,It was comfortable enough and within a good distance of the concert venue we were there for.
Hotel Boston,Linda Ortego,United States of America,1 review,August 13  2017,5.0,Our only complaint was that the hotel is not the cleanest!  Very simple but lacking space and just felt old and dirty . We were told that they are going to be remodeling it very soon. But...I would not stay there again.,The staff was amazing!  Helpful and very friendly!  We asked how to get to the different colleges and to downtown Boston.....excellent directions!
Hotel Boston,Gabriella,Italy,12 Reviews,August 10  2017,7.1,The hotel is 40 min far from downtown with green lime train. which is ok. Unfortunately.

Good breakfast
Hotel Boston,Sandra,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 3  2017,10,N/A,Everything was fine except for the directions given to me by phone from the hotel on the morning of my trip. I asked about the subway/train.  She all come to the end at Boston College?  Yes.. So I did and imagine at 12 PM at night. me at 77. without a cell phone. in the rain....... was told...oh that is 5 stops back on the train!  Fortunately the conductor looked 1650 Commonwealth up and dropped me off adjacent to the property which is hidden from the road by construction.
Hotel Boston,Catherine,Ireland,6 Reviews,August 1  2017,2.9,The accommodation in filthy. The bath was terrible. If you had it at home you would've replaced it years ago. The air con. tho it worked was archaic. The stinky funky smell when you opened the door to go into the room was wicked. Though you adjusted to it when you were inside for a bit. The breakfast wa dreadful. It was all stodgy food. Prepacked everything. No fresh fruit. There was fruit but I did not try it. I would imagine it was all tinned with syrupy juice for it to float around in. And please. all paper plates and bowls. and plastic cutlery. It was unbearable. The dining was so small you couldn't swing a cat in it which was the reason everyone chatted to each other in the morning while in it as your chairs were so close together. You had no choice. Also one morning I had to show an employee an insect running up the kitchen wall . She didn't do anything but call the front desk guy. who killed with his hand and then proceeded to replenish the milk cartons in the fridge without washing them. The guys at the front desk were very nice. Didn't get their names. And the girl attending th dining room on the first morning was lovely.  You had to clean the tables down yourself before sitting to breakfast as there was not someone attending all of he time.The reason we stayed there was that we were visiting our son who lives on Commomwealth Ave and we thought it was on the same Ave.  but if I had my time over I would give it a wide berth.,The bed was comfortable.
Hotel Boston,Bruce,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 25  2017,7.5,Would still like to find something  less expensive. The only eggs for breakfast were hard boiled eggs. Scrambled with bacon would have been nice.,Location. Close to where our kids live (within walking distance).
Hotel Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 21  2017,5.0,The toilet was plugged up on our arrival. thank god it wasn't actually overflowing.,Breakfast was pretty much carbohydrates. with a slimy looking boiled egg available for protein.
Hotel Boston,Snezana,Canada,1 review,July 21  2017,7.9,The hotel was not fancy or high-end. no bells and whistles. but it was certainly clean and it served our purposes well.  We got exactly what we were looking for.,The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The hotel was exceptionally well lit at night - including the parking area which was a nice safety feature.  The access to close public transit was one of the best features of the hotel.  It was a 2 minute walk to the commuter rail.  It took about 20 minutes to get to Fenway Park and about 30-35 minutes to get to the downtown core depending on time of day.  No transfers required - very easy trip into the city centre.  I would certainly stay there again.
Hotel Boston,Jessica,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 17  2017,5.8,The bathtub was not clean.  I found a hair ball in the pillowcase after stripping the bed the morning of our departure.  There was a bug squished on the ceiling as well.,The staff was pleasant.  The property was close to the T-stop.
Hotel Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 17  2017,6.7,Rooms were dated.  I thought parking would be included as was wifi.,Good breakfast options - Belgian waffle maker. pancake maker. fruit. oatmeal. cold cereals. bagels. toast &amp; hard boiled eggs were all available.  Drinks include OJ. coffee. tea &amp; hot chocolate.
Hotel Boston,Traveler,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 15  2017,6.7,1) Had to pay $20.00/day + tax parking and that information was not given on Booking.Com2) Had to pay for roll away bed $10/day + tax that should have been included with the room since we made a 3 person/room reservation.,The staff was very friendly.
Hotel Boston,Melanie,New Zealand,5 Reviews,July 11  2017,5.0,The room was not as clean &amp; pleasant as what was portrayed in the photos. The decor is long overdue for a freshen-up &amp; new carpets are definitely required.The location was a little further out of the city than we realized. but we were traveling by car so it was no problem to drive into the city &amp; use inner-city parking for the evening.,The beds were clean. The check-in &amp; check-out staff were very pleasant &amp; helpful. The breakfast was a very pleasant surprise. We were expecting coffee &amp; a muffin &amp; so we ate some cereal in our room. On check-out we discovered that breakfast was a real breakfast. complete with fresh fruit. hard boiled eggs. make your own waffles &amp; pancakes. cereal. coffee. juices etc etc. So we sat down &amp; enjoyed breakfast before departing.
Hotel Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 10  2017,9.6,When we arrived our toilet wasn't flushing correctly. But the staff was there in minutes to fix the issue. They were wonderful.,The staff were very friendly and helpful. The property was very clean.
Hotel Boston,Maureen,United States of America,1 review,July 7  2017,9.2,$20 parking fee,Location perfect to take train into city. Neighborhood quiet nestled in a pocket of charm. Staff very professional and attentive.  A little pricy for our standards (we are thrifty) but worth every penny.
Hotel Boston,Frances,United States of America,1 review,June 28  2017,7.5,It is a little outdated. First day the breakfast choices were a little sparce.  There wasn't anyone replenishing,The location was good for what we were there for. It was reasonably priced.
Hotel Boston,Marilyn,United States of America,1 review,June 24  2017,4.2,Room in major need of repairs. Wall paper dirty and missing in some places. Curtains dirty and had holes.  Floor by ac unit unsafe to walk on. Cracks in the ceiling. Bathroom so small you could barely turn around in it. You had to stand in the tub to reach the faucets to turn on shower. You have to pay $20.00 a night to park on the hotel parking lot. The pictures posted are very deceiving . This is an exterior property and the bathroom is at the front of the room by walkway so. even though the windows frosted. people can see the shadow of you in the bathroom . We had the room cleaned while we were there. This consisted of them making the beds. (did not change sheets). removing trash. replacing towels.. No vacuuming done. no mopping done. then didn't leave and wash cloths.,Breakfast was okay
Hotel Boston,Katherine,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 23  2017,5.8,I paid over $500 for 2 nights stay including parking and breakfast. The hotel was basically a Motel 6 in disguise. Breakfast was cold cereal/stale muffins &amp; bagels/make your own pancakes and waffles. limited fresh fruit all served on small paper plates and bowls. I guess its just expensive to stay in Boston. Certainly not value for the $$.,N/A
Hotel Boston,La,United States of America,1 review,June 22  2017,2.9,This property was old and had bugs in the bathroom.  The toilet was cracked  and the options for TV were limited.  There was no availabilty for handicap. no elevator.  The first night. there were police surrounding the hotel.  Pretty seedy area.  The breakfast was horrible. The boiled eggs were in water and nothing appeared appetizing.  The orange juice was more water then juice.  Overall this is not a place that I would ever stay at again.  Requested another room and it was worse. We paid a lot of money.  In california this would be considered the bottom of the barrel.  I cannot believe that your site is offering such a horrible property.  The pavement was uneven and very hard to walk on.  This property needs renovating like yesterday.  The pictures are a false sense of what this property really looks like in person.  The advertisement for the breakfast was totally misrepresented.  We had to dine a different locations for breakfast as the breakfast was substandard.,The person at the front desk was courteous.
Hotel Boston,Mary,United States of America,1 review,June 20  2017,7.9,Not many restaurants within close proximity. although Beacon Street nearby. Could use some writing materials in the room. but not much to complain about.,We were surprised and happy with our stay at Hotel Boston. Went to see Dead show at Fenway. Accommodations were great. parking was easy and easy access to transit. Plus. staff was friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay again!
Hotel Boston,Jennife,United States of America,1 review,June 12  2017,7.9,There is no sign out front. If we would have taken the train from the hotel. we would have never known where the hotel was from the train stop.,The hotel was close to the green line which makes it very convenient. The outside of the hotel looks a little run down but they are remodeling? Our room was clean and the staff was very friendly. I asked my husband if he would stay there again and he said yes.
Hotel Boston,Brandon,United States of America,1 review,June 10  2017,6.3,The facilities were outdated. Could use some modernizing. And we got nickel and dimed a little too much for my comfort. Extra for parking. the price went up after the reservation.,The room was large and spacious as the pictures on the website indicated.
Hotel Boston,Lourdes,United States of America,1 review,June 10  2017,7.1,Parking fee was not mentioned on the website. General outside appearance needs work. as well as room asthetics. Overpriced.,Breakfast was good. Check in and check out fast and courteous.
Hotel Boston,Jeff,United States of America,10 Reviews,June 9  2017,5.8,Fairly long walk to downtown Boston and not many places to stop along the way. You can take the T that's close by. which we learned on the second day.  We returned to our room after midnight and there was a temperature control issue and it was 86 degrees in our room. We had to prop the door open to the outside (not ideal) for at least an hour to cool it off. Front desk informed us there were other rooms with the same problem and no one would be there to fix it until the next morning. I was given a card to call the manager and got 100.00 off that night's stay. Not sure that was sufficient but it is what it is.,Convenient parking. though at 20.00 a night. but at least it's right on the property and not a parking garage. It's probably a great location for college graduations.
Hotel Boston,Cherie,United States of America,1 review,June 6  2017,8.3,GPS kept directing us to the rear of the property but it was not marked as "Hotel Boston" anywhere. so we drove around the block a few times before finding the front entrance by the Hotel Boston sign.Parking was convenient but strange on that hillside.  $20.00 to park one night... not good.,The staff at front desk was polite and friendly.  The rooms were very clean and simple but tasteful. The beds were very comfortable.  Free wifi. coffee maker &amp; supplies. microwave. and fridge a nice bonus!
Hotel Boston,Tracy,United States of America,1 review,June 1  2017,4.2,No accommodation. I pay $179 neat home and it has a heated pool. work out room. got tub. room service. How in the hell do u get away with charging over $300?!?!?!,I have never paid that much money for a "motel" style place. Paying $340 I thought I was getting a nice plush room . I couldn't even fit in the bath tub! There was no pool... no accommodation at all! I will never stay at a hotel for this price again. So very very disappointed
Hotel Boston,Ryan,United States of America,1 review,June 1  2017,7.5,Toilet didn't work very well and eventually stopped working.,The place had short access to the T and was pretty easy to get to. Room was well kept and clean. plus staff was helpful.
Hotel Boston,Kim,United States of America,1 review,May 31  2017,8.8,There was a large gap between the door and the frame. it let in light and could have been a problem if the weather was cold.,The beds were comfy and we were able to walk to our daughter's apartment.
Hotel Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,May 30  2017,4.6,The staff needs to advertise that parking is available BUT at a cost of $20 per night per car. It simply says parking on premises. Hotel Boston is not visible from Constitution Avenue. The bathroom is very. very small for a King Bed Room. I do not like hotels that have rooms that open to the outside for safety reasons. I was traveling with another female. It does not state this on the website or I would not have booked this location. We attended Havard University in Cambridge. The hotel is close to Cambridge which was my reason for selecting it.,There was a refrigerator in the room!! Excellent!
Hotel Boston,John,United States of America,1 review,May 24  2017,2.9,bugs. ants. spiders. silverfish. the walls were scuffed like a college dorm. musty smell. the drawers would not stay closed because the room is tilted downward. and the drapes were outdated and very dirty. I was able to take a few pics and a short video of a very large ant moving along the sink while i brushed my teeth. I did not shower there du to the silverfish bugs in shower.  the window sills are disgusting. The fact that I was asked to even pay for onenight was borderline stealing,the proximity to boston college
Hotel Boston,Susan,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 20  2017,5.4,There was a major construction project next door that started at 7am. no way to sleep after that. Bed was OK. not great. Shower water pressure was poor. Had to switch rooms after AC failed. That room also had failed AC but they did compensate us some for that which was good because it was not worth the price I paid for sure.,Location was good for us. close to daughters apartment.  very close to public transportation. Easily took it downtown to freedom trail. ride was 30 minutes. Décor was nice. and pretty clean.
Hotel Boston,Pedro,Brazil,21 Reviews,May 18  2017,7.9,Parking costs USD 20. Also. location is not the best for tourists. although the vicinity is nice. I ended up choosing this hotel because of the price. but wouldn't recommend to people who wants to walk from the hotel to the touristic places.,The room was comfortable and breakfast was fairly good.
Hotel Boston,Carlos,United States of America,1 review,May 6  2017,4.2,The floor in my room needed padding underneath the carpet to suppress the noise. same as the room above. Every time someone walked in the room above. we heard the noise. Very disturbing when you are tired trying to sleep. The cleaning team did not bother to replace the toilet paper or replace the used towel left on the floor.,One of the staff members was very friendly and answered all of my questions.
Hotel Boston,Daniel,United States of America,1 review,May 4  2017,6.7,There was a hot water pipe running through the the bedroom which made a loud booming noise 24/7. It sounded like I was in the engine room of a ship. When I informed the staff. they just said that they'd had that complaint from other rooms but not ours. It was so loud I couldn't sleep in the bedroom. which had a nice comfortable bed in it. I spent the night on a 5 foot couch in the living area - not very comfortable at all!,Good breakfast. Large. clean room with a separate bedroom. Clean bathroom with plenty of hot water.
Hotel Boston,Meagan,United States of America,1 review,May 3  2017,5.0,Room smelt of wet moldy carpet. Pillows on the bed were the size of throw pillows. And...THIS PAY AT PROPERTY LISTING CHARGES YOUR CREDIT CARD MORNING OF CHECK IN. NOT WHEN YOU ARRIVE!!!!,N/A
Hotel Boston,James,United States of America,1 review,May 1  2017,6.7,No AC. Got as hot as 80 degrees in room. However. when notified at front desk they did credit our bill total .,Location was great in what we were there for
Hotel Boston,Lilly,United States of America,1 review,April 29  2017,5.0,The air control system kept turning the heat on. Had to pay for movies $20. bathroom was like falling apart. Water pressure wasn't great and the door stuck.,I like that if we had more people the rooms could've connected. liked the mini fridge.  The guy at the front desk was really nice and informative! (:
Hotel Boston,Eamonn,United Kingdom,1 review,April 6  2017,7.5,Rooms need an update. in U.K. You would expect waiter/waitress service for Breakfast with a cooked meal as an option on China plates as an option.,Breakfast selection okay. Would stay again or recommend to a friend.
Hotel Boston,Noel,United States of America,1 review,March 22  2017,2.5,Everything! The facility was poor. the rooms were old. the breakfast was not edible. It was a noisy place and the room dividers were paper thin. It's way overpriced! Go elsewhere!!,Nothing!!

Hotel Boston,Gary,United States of America,1 review,March 16  2017,7.9,They did not have my reservation. A problem with booking.com. had to wait 40 minutes at front desk to clear it up.

Hotel Boston,Alan,United States of America,1 review,March 12  2017,5.4,Our room key didn't work several times. Had to go back to office several times in frigid cold temperatures to have them re-program the key card. Breakfast sucked. TV in dinning area was playing the Communist News Network (CNN) really dislike FAKE news while I'm eating. Was informed upon arrival that there was an additional $20.00 Parking Fee. Paid $191.00 dollars for one night. I have stayed in Motel 6 hotels for half the price with better overall quality. Bummer trip,Location
Hotel Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,March 10  2017,4.2,Heater was not working.  Watched hotel staff mislead New guests arriving.  Our purpose for trip and its importance was our priority.  We froze and were uncomfortable.,Free hot cocoa.

Hotel Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,January 24  2017,7.5,My room was next to the drink machine and it rumbled through the wall quite loudly when the cooler turned on. Unfortunately I didn't notice this until I arrived at the room to go to sleep at 1 AM or I would have asked for a different room.So. don't take take room 101.,Proximity to where I needed to be.
Hotel Boston,Dalton,United States of America,1 review,December 10  2016,6.3,Had no idea parking was $20 until I noticed it on my banking app. No one informed me. only asked if I was parking a vehicle.,Breakfast was awesome. room was affordable. place seemed clean.
Hotel Boston,Anonymous,Israel,1 review,December 5  2016,7.5,Buildings are not capital and when somebody walking on the above floor you filling each step.,Around half an hour walk from Boston College. Few markets near the hotel. especially "whole food" where you can buy ready cooked food.
Hotel Boston,Beverly,United States of America,3 Reviews,November 14  2016,5.8,There was nobody at the front desk when we arrived. She showed up five mins later and seemed annoyed that we were there. Couldn't control heat. Room was too hot. Shower nozzle didn't fit in the holder so dangled and had to be propped up.,It was quiet. clean and seemed safe enough.
Hotel Boston,Mehgan,United States of America,2 Reviews,November 12  2016,8.8,Water pressure in shower was low but still got the job done.,Felt welcoming. breakfast was much nicer than any other free continental breakfast I've seen.

Hotel Boston,James,United States of America,1 review,October 30  2016,9.2,N/A,The lady at the front desk was very friendly and spent time explaining the subway system.  The room was a great value for Boston - free parking. T stop near by. I will stay here again when I am in Boston.
Hotel Boston,Boston,United States of America,1 review,October 28  2016,5.8,The hotel is old and totally not worth what they charge.  The hotel had no hot water while we were there. and they still have not offered us any compensation for that.  Unprofessional move.,The location is great.  The T-stop is steps away from the hotel.  We had several issues that required us to change rooms twice. and the staff was very accommodating and professional (except for compensating us in some way for the lack of hot water.)
Hotel Boston,Nicole,United States of America,1 review,October 20  2016,6.7,The AC broke on 2nd night so the room was at 84 degrees.  I called desk and was told to open a window.  I should have been given a new room. instead of being told to open a window with a broken screen. and left to feel unsafe.  So not willing to do that i slept in an extremely hot and uncomfortable room.,Clean. convenient location

Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Mary,Ireland,15 Reviews,October 10  2017,9.2,We arrived early two hrs prior to check in. There was no area to leave cases so we had to bring them with us.

Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Elizabeth,Canada,5 Reviews,June 21  2017,8.3,When advertised on site it says parking and to contact apartment MGT to book. When I did this I was told that there was no parking attached to the apartment complex and I would have to do this on my own.....false advertising... instead drove to Woburn parked and took train into North Station and green line to Commons.  Very easy and cheap!!!! The pull out couch was terrible!  Ended up trading so friend could get a good sleep and slept on couch without pulling it out!,The location was good for walking to Boston's tourist attractions. Not in the best of neighborhoods...a lot of homeless people with addiction problems..do not an area to wander the streets at night by oneself.The building is safe and clean.

Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Nancy,United States of America,1 review,January 24  2017,9.6,Not being able to talk to someone on sight was strange. but other than checking in and out I had no reason to interact. Leaving a message that I was checking out on time left me a little uneasy but we will see how that goes.,I was a little worried after reading reviews. but our room was very quiet and clean (tenth floor). The noise from outside was minimal. We were able to walk to various destinations. We found a parking garage around the corner that was only $27 forb24 hours. Our stay was super short but I would definitely stay here again.
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Kelly,United States of America,6 Reviews,January 2  2017,10,The heat/air system can be a bit noisy. but it wasn't too disruptive. just noticeable when turning on at night.,The location and amenities were excellent. We had a scenic view and truly enjoyed the location.  We were comfortable and had an easy time using public transport to/from the airport and all over town. Plenty of cafes and restaurants in the area and a short walk to a huge Whole Foods.

Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Sheryl,Australia,1 review,November 17  2016,8.8,Not happy on arrival. after having written confirmation of our city view with balcony - 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment - that we had been mysteriously placed in a non-city view without balcony apartment but the person/s who had originally been allocated the room - had their welcome letter in the apartment we were checked in to!  As a tourist. it is sometimes too hard to argue due to being very tired.  The rep from the apartments (after we had been checked in for a few hours) called in to see how we were going.  I explained what we had booked and he mentioned there is a corner room available and he would get back to us by 8pm to switch rooms.  Of course that didn't happen.,Beautiful modern. clean and comfortable 2 bedroom. 2 bathroom apartment in a wonderful location
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Catherine,Australia,1 review,November 10  2016,4.6,We had a terrible experience here.  There was only one towel supplied for a two bedroom apartment with 3 occupants.  There was no-one available who could remedy this despite the contact line being advertised as 24 hour.  When someone finally responded. they said that they would not be able to have any towels delivered and said that someone would be in touch to discuss compensation.  No-one did despite further contact being made with the operators.  This was a very expensive place to stay and the service was so bad that there is no point in staying here.,N/A

Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Susan,Bermuda,2 Reviews,October 28  2016,5.0,Very noisy two bedroom apartment even though it was on the 8th floor you could hear all noise from the street. Late night party goers going home. Then at 430am most mornings the trash lorry arrived to empty the trash bins.  On our second night the alarm system went off on our floor at 230am with the arrival of two fire engines at the property. No explanation or reason given when asked.  We had a four night stay with very little sleep. On contacting Global Luxury Suites twice. initially asking to be moved and hearing nothing back I contacted them again twice and still have no response. Very poor customer relations.,N/A
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,laughing dragon,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 25  2016,8.8,Room was not the same size or style as described or pictured. Full sized beds. Small unit. No information available on parking rates prior to arrival. Parking exceeded $50 per day.  Garage charged hourly with each entry and exit and would not negotiate a flat daily fee. Ice Bin. ice trays. salt and pepper shakers were all empty upon arrival.,Perfect and convenient T location. Fantastic building and staff. Dunkin Donuts and Wine Store on same block. Clean room and comfortable beds. You could easily stay here without a car and use T and Uber for everything. We would choose this again over our usual stay at large downtown hotel at Copley.
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Jo,Australia,3 Reviews,October 24  2016,7.5,The booking. specifically the paperwork. process was very poor.  We gave booked similar properties all over the world and nothing compared to how bad their booking processes were.  In fact. Citibank considered the manner in which Global Luxury charged our MC as fraudulent and closed our account.  Much effort was expended on our part and their customer service team did not assist in any way nor responded to emails that we sent as per their instructions during the booking phase.Water was turned off for several hours during one of the days we spent.,Spacious 2 bedroom.full kitchen.  full suze washer/dryer and health club atmosphere.  Security set-up was a nice feature

Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Eas,United States of America,1 review,October 5  2016,9.2,There was some issues with bath tubs not draining and one of the windows in the bedroom wouldn't fully latch so you could hear a lot of outside noise.

Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Robert,United States of America,1 review,October 5  2016,5.4,The beds were absolutely horrible. Loud creaks from cheap mattress springs and it was extremely uncomfortable especially when 2 people were in the bed. I slept on the floor 2 of the 3 nights. I would not recommend anyone to stay in apartment 19G at 660 Washington street in Boston. The owners clearly don't care about comfortable sleeping. We almost forfeited one night and went to a motel to get some sleep despite paying almost $500 per night.,The living space and kitchen was really nice.
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Delos,United Kingdom,1 review,September 29  2016,10,Honestly. nothing. it was great and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.,Very nice apartment with great set up for two individuals traveling together on business.
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Keiko,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 27  2016,9.2,We stayed for 3 nights.  We wished there were enough coffee (powder). sugar. and detergent (for laundry).The controlar of TV in the living room didn't work.,The facility is clean. very spacious and comfortable.  It was nice to be able to use the washer (laundry) and to eat breakfast at the table.
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Bonita,United States of America,1 review,September 20  2016,6.7,The price and the fact that I accepted $409 charge but got a $568 charge.,The room was nice but not for the price.  I didn't expect the cleaning charge and got a bill for $150 more than I expected.
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 19  2016,5.4,Kitchen not stocks with basics. need iron and blankets for pull out,Location is convenient to T. but in a sketchy area would not want to be out after dark in this area.
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Sha,Malaysia,1 review,September 8  2016,9.6,The cleaners were at the door sharp at 11 am . as we were preparing to leave. That could  have waited until we exited - for privacy .,Convenient location&amp; amenities.
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Bader,Kuwait,2 Reviews,August 13  2016,7.1,A/C was noisy had difficulty sleeping.couldn't adjust the water temperature in the shower (the handle slides down). so it was either too hot or too cold.,the place was very clean and good sized apartment for 1-2 travelers.
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Malcolm,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,August 1  2016,8.8,The blinds didn't shut out the light very effectively in our midsummer visit this meant some early wake-ups.,We had a minor plumbing leak which was dealt with (almost invisibly to us) very promptly.The living space was good and comfortable; the pool and gym were decent.Central location was extremely well connected. by foot or for the T to reach all of central Boston.
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Anonymous,Ireland,1 review,July 23  2016,9.2,No late checkout. Global suites blamed booking.com and booking.com did not reply to any email.,Centrally located in downtown Boston. Close to all amenities.
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Samantha,United States of America,1 review,July 12  2016,6.7,100 cleaning fee for a little apartment. Overpriced.,It was okay. Definitely not worth the money. I do book hotels on the regular. first time renting an apartment and I do regret renting this particular one. Very small. Just wasn't worth it. It was clean. but I know what is money worth. And to charge 100 to clean that little place? That's absurd.
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Stacey,United States of America,1 review,June 8  2016,9.6,Nothing major- just noticed that a few items needed servicing or minor up keeping such as Refrigerator door wouldn't close &amp; toilet kids were a little loose.  We notified the front desk and Danny in Maintanance came up immediately to help!,Really enjoyed staying in this property- Luxury high rise. prime location. in the heart of the Theater District. The apt itself was modern &amp; very spacious- 2 beds/ 2 baths. Also- in response to the other reviews left by prior guests: - Comfort of beds/ extra sheets/ blankets- No issues here! Our apt came well equipped with extra towels. extra pillows &amp; blankets. -Building Staff- Reviews are correct- the building staff does not work for the property management company. but we're friendly and able to answer questions. As an FYI- This building is occupied by mostly tenants. and i think its fair to say that if you plan on staying here probably shouldn't expect the "At your service" treatment you would get from a Corporate Hotel that awards points. What you should expect is a welcoming &amp; helpful doorman. friendly front desk &amp; maintanance staff who's able to answer general questions.  - Chuck the concierge&amp; Danny from maintanance get two thumbs up!!!
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Janet,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 31  2016,9.6,Would have been good to have had some more kitchenware. No platters or baking trays. Only 1 coffee cup for 4 people,Gorgeous views and high quality furnishings. Very clean
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Rosalie,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,May 1  2016,6.3,The mattress was old. colasped and the springs incredibly noisey. The carpet was stained. the lock on one of the bathroom doors was broken. there was no shower curtain in one bathroom and the phone did not work.,The location
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Heather,United States of America,1 review,April 27  2016,8.3,It appeared to have all students living there although they are quiet and friendly I did feel like I was in a dorm.  I had to re-wash my own sheets because they were full of hair that was a little disgusting and the rug in the living room was absolutely disgusting. And the furniture was a bit run down and the bed mattress was absolutely awful.  In fact my husband wanted to check out it was so bad but at $400 a night with no reimbursement we decided to stay.,I loved the location. the place was beautiful. well laid out.  Right next to the tea and great restaurants .
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,April 27  2016,6.3,The beds were extremely hard and very uncomfortable. no one slept well.  The apartment is cheaply built. and for $500 a night I expected a LOT more.  Salt and pepper shakers were provided but we're empty so not very useful.  Only one box of laundry soap was provided so if you're planning to do laundry. bring your own soap.  Only one box of dishwasher soap was provided so we had to wash most items by hand so we'd have something to eat off of every night..  There were no pot holders for taking things out of the oven. The fry pans were Teflon. but the four cooking utensils (whisk. large slotted spoon. spatula.  soup ladle) were metal. so the Teflon was getting scrapped up. The utensils were also too large for most things we were cooking.  The second bedroom had a bed. two night stands and two lamps. but the night stands were grouped next to each other and not on either side of the bed (not useful!) There was an alarm clock. but it wasn't plugged in because the lamps were taking up the only outlets in the room.  The master bedroom door wouldn't close all the way because the dresser was too long and the door hit it.  The master was the only bedroom with a TV. would have been better to have a tv in both rooms and a full length mirror would have been nice too.The bathrooms were ok. but cheap counters and cabinets.I would not recommend this hotel/apartment to anyone for the price they are charging.  If the cost per night were under $200. yea I'd stay here again because the location is perfect.,The location is perfect.  Right by the orange line T station and could get everywhere we needed to go quickly and easily.A small roll of paper towels were provided along with dish soap and two kitchen hand towels.A laundry basket was provided.The fitness room was fairly large with treadmills. ellipticals. free weights and selecterized machines.  Fitness mats and balls.
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Rosina,United Kingdom,9 Reviews,April 26  2016,8.8,Both bedrooms had double beds - we needed one to be a twin. No decent breakfast places nearby. No instructions for TV or heating. If we'd paid full price. a hotel would be better.,Central location - close to South Station.
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Anonymous,Australia,1 review,April 22  2016,3.3,Requested crib and was never delivered. Loud and noisy kept our baby up all night from the street noise and rooms next door. Staff were unhelpful and kept telling us to call a number who were even more unhelpful. We paid over $800 per night and for his type of money we would expect a lot more!,N/A
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Patricia,United States of America,3 Reviews,April 21  2016,10,Nothing,This is an ideal location and size apartment for two adults and a preteen. The apartment was spacious and clean as was the building The door man was very helpful and we felt right at home here.
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Robert,Canada,4 Reviews,April 19  2016,7.9,Very late official check in time (4pm) and our unit wasn't available until nearly 5pm. The managers of the property are offsite and do not respond to problems that came up in an effective and professional manner. As our flight got in at 11. and we had work to do in Boston the afternoon of our arrival. at the time of the reservation. I asked the management company. Churchill. whether there would be anywhere to securely leave our bags. She said there were lock ups at the apartment for that purpose. When we got there this turned out to be untrue. And no one at the concierge desk could/would help us since they are a different company... and Churchill's 'emergency' line staff would not take responsibility or help us either. Then when we did finally get in after much delay there was only one key to share between the 3 people in our party. Repeated requests to Churchill resulted in promises but no extra key over the whole time of our stay.All in all a frustrating experience and unprofessionally run operation. That said. the facilities are good and clean.,Size of apartment. location and cleanliness

Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Tom,United States of America,1 review,April 3  2016,8.8,Beds and pull out sofa are not comfortable. Upgraded king size beds and sofa bed would be a big plus.  Other than that the apartment was very nice.,Location was great! Restaurants. subway access. shopping. convenience stores. easy access to site seeing. Water pressure in the showers in the apartment are great!
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Nuha,Saudi Arabia,15 Reviews,April 3  2016,9.2,As a genius member I expected the offer of booking for early check In and late checkout which was declined,Centrally located with T stations close by. shopping steps away Rooms were spacious and staff were very helpful
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Dennis,United States of America,1 review,March 30  2016,5.8,The bed was very saggy in the middle which caused me a sore back and hip.There were no room darkening shades. The kitchen faucet would only spray and not flow. The front door had not stripping along the frame and allowed a lot of hall noise and some smoke to enter the unit. Poor lighting in the bathroom. The stopper in the sink in the bathroom would not hold water. There were no premium cable chanels and pictures were not HD. The chair at the desk needed to be replaced and the sofa was very uncomfortable.,Chuck was very nice and the location great and the small welcome packages helpful. Nice lobby.
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Brenda,Ireland,3 Reviews,March 26  2016,8.3,Could not get the phone to work and no specific instructions regarding how to retrieve a missed call number or how to get an outside lineMet some resistance when asking to have my luggage stored when checking out.,Location was excellent. Most of the staff were very helpful
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Mireille,United States of America,1 review,March 22  2016,7.5,I must have had same room as previous reviewer: I booked a King and got two twins. The aircon was extremely loud; the plug in bathtub didn't work. Also the dishwasher was broken. so had to hand wash everything. Room looked much different than the photos.,The location was central - close to Boston Commons (where there is a great dog park); and walking distance to everywhere else.The lobby staff were lovely and I'd go back just for them! Loved having a kitchen - which has good appliances. I also liked the gift bag with the popcorn :). Apartment was clean and bed comfortable..and easier to sleep when the air con was off.
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Tamara,United States of America,1 review,March 1  2016,9.6,The telephones were not charged and could not call to the front desk. The television in the living room didn't work. It would be great if basics like salt and pepper could also be provided.,Loved the bed and the view. Great care packages with some of the essentials.
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Marie,United States of America,1 review,February 28  2016,10,Only thing that scared me was the blow dryer set up. It  should have been attached to wall but was not.  but the dryer itself was attached to the housing that would  have  attach to wall. very difficult to use. as the wall housing was hanging off dryer as you used it and smacking into your head. Scared me because when I first noticed my Daughter was using dryer with some water in the sink and housing could have very easily drop in sink as you lowered you dryer/ hand action as she dried  her hair. Oversight I believe everything else was excellent. I did meant to bring it to staff attention before I left but forgot we just didn't use again.,Loved the apartment a lot bigger than I expected. We traveled with 10 &amp; 11 year old we had  2 double bedrooms each with walk in closet and there own bathroom. Full kitchen fully stocked. living room &amp; dining room open plan. Washer dryer vacuum cleaner. Everything was great beds very comfortable cotton sheets. will be our go too place when  we return to Boston. Location great  very central we walked to most parts of the city. The T is very close orange line.   Great  Restaurants &amp; shopping. Great views of the city.

Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Colin,United States of America,1 review,February 16  2016,9.6,The apartment had free WiFi. but it was was so slow it was unusable for our phones.On a busy street. so not easy to get to and loud on weekend nights.,The beds were comfortable and the apartment was a good size. There were 5 adults in a 2 bedroom with a pull out couch and we all fit with no issues. The apartment was very clean and had most everything we needed. There was free coffee on the 2nd floor in a lounge. It was a vending-style machine so you could get whatever coffee you wanted.The staff were very helpful and friendly. It was easy to walk or take a car anywhere.  A great place to stay.
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Justin,United States of America,3 Reviews,February 15  2016,7.9,The room was incredibly dry and stuffy and we were given two twin beds instead of the advertised queen size bed. Staff at the appt complex was unable to help with room requests cause they were not affiliated with Global Luxury Suites.,Fully furnished clean appt. Easy check-in and check-out process. helpful staff.

Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Vonn,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,January 26  2016,2.5,I have been charged twice for our stay with GSA. Having contacted the property managers directly to ask them to refund the mistake. as yet. two weeks after the fact. they haven't even had the courtesy to acknowledge my contact. Currently working with Booking.com to resolve. Unnecessary and time-wasting and an experience which has marred my first trip to this great city!This was after they changed our accommodation at the last minute meaning we didn't have use of the pool. which was a key selling point for us at the time of booking.Last but not least. beware of the extortionate charges for cleaning (regardless of the fact that we left the place 'as found' and taxes; these are inconveniently not included in the 'headline' price.,Boston. itself. as a city was just fabulous! We also stayed at the Haborside Hotel for some of our trip and would definitely recommend! Convenient location. friendly staff and great value!
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,January 21  2016,7.9,Cannot drop luggage off before check-in time of 4:00 pm.  If you are flying in with luggage. you will be stuck dragging it around Boston.  Also. street noise VERY LOUD on weekend nights. especially between 2:00 and 3:00 am.  Sirens. horns honking and people leaving bars. Not a problem on weeknights.,Location is great! There is plenty of space in the 2 bedroom apartment.
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Mary,Australia,13 Reviews,January 19  2016,8.3,Nothing,Apartment was sunny and spacious.

Location fabulous 5 min walk to Boston commons. Theatres and Macy in the street and Chinatown a block away
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Philomena,United Kingdom,40 Reviews,January 18  2016,7.9,There is no one to deal with directly as the property is owned by different rental agencies. The swift way in which money was debited from my card as soon as I made the booking though it had stated 2 weeks before arrival. Also the way they kept nagging me about check in and check out time. It really was not nice. I would say there was no friendly approach to it. sounded more like an office contract.,The property was neat and the apartment was lovely
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Tea,United States of America,1 review,January 12  2016,5.4,There wasn't a piece of furniture without a scratch. The pool was only for fitness and 3-4 feet deep throughout. There was no hot tub. and no room service. The staff was very unprofessional and not welcoming at all. My room looked nothing like the pictures. and need maintenance badly. The tub drain didn't work. the clocks didn't work. and all the doors had squeaky hinges. When they billed me. they billed three separate times from two different accounts and for amounts that didn't fit my reservation. causing a lot of confusion. They charged a hundred dollar 'cleaning fee' for a three day stay. and bill fees and taxes separately from the room cost. I would never stay here again. not even for half the amount they billed me.,Fitness club was beautiful. pool was clean. and the lobby was quite nice. Minimal noise from neighbors.
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Zach,Ireland,1 review,January 11  2016,10,N/A,We especially liked the personal attention we received from Mr. Hicham Belmir. whose pleasant. knowledged. and polite service enhanced considerably our enjoyable stay.We would highly recommend this apartment to others based on Mr. Belmir and the accomodations
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Aalzaidan,United States of America,5 Reviews,January 2  2016,10,There were small items that needed attention form the property management company. they have managed one of them.

Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Karisa,United States of America,1 review,December 31  2015,9.2,I didn't like how some of the bowls and plates had scratch marks on it already and the microwave smelled of burning popcorn.

Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,December 13  2015,9.6,The building is basically a dorm for all of the international students going to nearby suffulk or emerson college.,Great building with lots of amenities. Good location in the heart of busy downtown with lots of food/entertainment options
Global Luxury Suites at China Town,Carol,United Kingdom,30 Reviews,November 14  2015,10,The only negative comment was to get to Washington St by taxi from the airport. it is one-way via China Town and not the most attractive route!  We did have serious doubts as to where we were staying.  If there was access from the other direction. this would not be a problem.  However. it is more than a little off-putting to a tired traveller.,The location was absolutely fantastic. walking distance from most places.  The apartment was well-equipped with everything we needed and had plenty of hanging space for clothes.  The apartment was also quiet.

Bricco Suites,Kevin,United Kingdom,15 Reviews,October 28  2017,8.8,Only let down was the wifi was virtually non existent in our room. luckily I didn't have to work while there. Also sound proofing from other rooms above is a little irritating but bearable,Very lively area. great for eating out and visiting attractions of Boston. Very comfortable bed. good shower. Great coffee !
Bricco Suites,Donna,United States of America,1 review,October 25  2017,9.2,More help with luggage!,Beds were very comfortable. The room was very quiet for being in the heart of the North end.Although the parking garage was away from apartments they were very easy to get to and inexpensive.Check in was done in restaurant.but very easy!
Bricco Suites,Michelle,United States of America,17 Reviews,October 25  2017,9.2,N/A,We had apartment 102. a spacious one-bedroom with modern fixtures. a view to the back. over the fire escape and the roof tops of the North End. It was on the fourth floor with no elevator. which was not a problem for us but might be a consideration for others. Pick up of the keys is in the Bricco restaurant on the first floor. I had to text the staff for an extra blanket during our stay and they delivered it impressively quickly. The neighborhood is so lively and charming. and Hanover Street is the main drag. so when you step outside the entry door. you're immediately in the middle of activity. kind of like a mini trip to Italy.
Bricco Suites,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 23  2017,10,The rooms are directly above the Bricco restaurant. which can get  little loud at night. However. it is a very nice room with plentiful amenities and very kind employees. The location is right in the middle of the historical North End.,N/A
Bricco Suites,Thomas,United States of America,1 review,October 21  2017,7.1,This facility has a great location in north boston. and the rooms were clean. but a two bedroom unit has only one shared bathroom. a negative aspect. Worse is that this hotel does not have a lobby. and you must get a key from a restaurant desk. and than to reach the room go through another restaurant and bar to reach the stairs to the rooms. Quite unusual though functional once shown the way. I think your website should make these aspects clear. Boston is very expensive. and I felt misled by the presence of only one bath in a two bedroom unit.,N/A
Bricco Suites,Anonymous,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,October 17  2017,8.3,Unusual check in through restaurant.Too many stairs to apartments (especially with heavy luggage).No lift.,Excellent location in North end (Little Italy)  within walking distance of most attractions and restaurants in Boston. Beds comfortable. Apartments very clean. Could do with more facilities (microwave and/or toaster) in kitchen to make snack. Air con effective but noisy.
Bricco Suites,Heather,United Kingdom,17 Reviews,October 17  2017,5.8,The room was not a suite. there was nowhere to sit except a desk chair or the bed.  Access to the room was down a back alley.  Our room was on the ground floor over a bakery which had tables for customers at ground level so we could not have any blinds open. the side window faced another alley with a security light which came on an off all night.  None of the blinds fitted properly so with the lights outside the bakery and the security light our room was lighter in the night that it was in the day.  Totally over priced for what it was and the facilities available. very disappointed,The room was very clean and the location was great
Bricco Suites,Wendy,United States of America,1 review,October 16  2017,10,Street noise a little loud but would still come back . perhaps get a room towards back of building,Michael was a gracious and attentive host. The double suite was perfect for our party of 4 to lounge around in.The robes were cozy and the beds luxurious . We will definitely come back!
Bricco Suites,Jenny,United States of America,1 review,October 13  2017,10,we did not have a sofa in our room like in the pictures so that was disappointing.  it was also a little tricky finding where to check in (you go in the restaurant and check in with the hostess),location is fantastic!!!
Bricco Suites,Peter,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,October 5  2017,6.3,Very noisy because of extractor fans of next door building.

Bricco Suites,Sarah,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 5  2017,9.6,The front room was noisy with rubbish being collected from before 5am. Also a dining table would have been nice. more seating area and glasses etc.,Apartment was very spacious. beds were comfy.
Bricco Suites,Jonathan,United States of America,1 review,September 25  2017,9.6,Although this was not a big deal for us. those staying here should know it is not your typical hotel.  There are apartments above the restaurant.  You must check in at the restaurant.  There is no lobby.  Also . we stayed on the top floor (4th) and there is no elevator.  Again not a big deal of us. but may be for some.,The location was great.  Close to everything; all within walking distance.  We came in on an early flight and were able to get checked in earlier than in other hotels.  The rooms were very private and clean.  The bed was very comfortable.  Our host gave us a number of recommendations for breakfast and late night activities.  We would definitely return to Bricco again.
Bricco Suites,Kristin,United States of America,1 review,September 25  2017,7.9,They need another mirror in the suite outside of the bathroom,Location excellent; they should give you priority seating at the restaurant for being a guest.  And there was a lot of noise...banging. etc. all around the room.  Didn't keep us up. but was noticeable.
Bricco Suites,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 22  2017,6.7,When I read the reviews of others before booking. I was expecting just some street noise which would be understandable given the location. But our room's issues were entirely preventable. In fact. since it was off a back alley. there was no street noise at all. We were on the first floor right outside the main building door which does not lock properly. People would try and slam it at all hours of the night and there was zero noise insulation. You can also hear everyone on the stairs and all rooms around you. Combined with the bed being placed directly across from the room's door and an air conditioner with enough air pressure to launch a rocket into space. this was a perfect way to get a great night's sleep. You can also hear everyone on the stairs and all rooms around you. If you can sleep during this type of Dolby 5.1 surround sound experience. hats off to you.,Great location. nice furnishings. alley where our room was had old world Italian charm. Friendly staff.
Bricco Suites,Jeannine,Canada,11 Reviews,September 17  2017,9.6,The  suite had some plates and utensils but no dish detergent or tea towels. I think this is because they want to do the washing up - but even a roll of paper towels would have been handy for spills or drying our things.,The location was the best!! The suites were large and well suited for two couples. We stayed here pre-cruise and we could walk everywhere and even to the cruise terminal. The beds were wonderful and it was all very clean.
Bricco Suites,Kanecrew,United States of America,5 Reviews,September 16  2017,6.7,Kitchenette had a cooktop but no pans or supplies to be able to use the cooktop.  Really should have a microwave available in the suite.  Bathroom toiletries were not replaced when empty.  Refrigerator door had to be slammed so hard to close that I thought we were going to break it.  Emailed prior to stay asking for whale watching tour info- was told that they would go over that when we arrived then when I asked about a recommendation at check in. I was told to look online.  Suite and bedroom size is deceiving in the pictures.,The location.
Bricco Suites,Andrew,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,September 15  2017,9.6,Didn't know where to go initially but the host was in the adjacent bar so sussed it out pretty quickly. I think I was just being dumb actually cos it's pretty obvious,Fantastic accommodation in a perfect location. So many places to eat. drink and explore within easy walking distance and incredibly reasonably priced compared to other hotels in Boston. I think I may have got lucky with a late cancellation as I feel really lucky to have found this place at short notice.
Bricco Suites,Paula,United States of America,1 review,September 8  2017,10,I cannot think of one single thing that could have made this stay any better.,Location was great. exceptionally good food and service at the restaurant. room was clean and more than exceeded all expectations. Everyone there went above and beyond to be helpful and friendly. Hidden perks...excellent bread and pasta/sandwich shop. This is truly a hidden jewel and a great value!  Will definitely return!
Bricco Suites,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 4  2017,8.3,It is odd walking through restaurant with luggage to get to room. Come and go through waiters. etc... They are all nice and very helpful though. Just not a normal experience.,N/A
Bricco Suites,Anonymous,China,2 Reviews,August 29  2017,6.7,as it locates in resturant area. street sound is too loud. during our stay there is fire alarm. no timely communication of what is going on. which is very scary...,location is good. in walking distance to north church and quincy. many choices for dinner. breakfast..
Bricco Suites,Barbara,United States of America,1 review,August 23  2017,10,Our windows looked out onto brick walls. but now we know to ask for a room facing Hanover Street in the future.,We felt we were treated with warmth. charm. and graciousness from the moment we arrived.  Definitely different than a huge. impersonal hotel.  When we stay in Boston. we stay/dine at Bricco from now on!
Bricco Suites,Dean,United States of America,6 Reviews,August 12  2017,8.3,We have stayed here a few times and the manager of the restaurant also manages the condos and is not friendly at all. There are no elevators which is fine but were a little surprised when we got there.,Nice and clean and good location
Bricco Suites,Seth,United States of America,16 Reviews,August 11  2017,10,Parking was in a public garage. a little far to walk with lots of luggage. A voucher or something would have been nice. since we needed to pay every time we took out our car.,Great location in the North End. yet tucked at the back of an alley so felt very private and calm once we got to our room.
Bricco Suites,Gail,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 10  2017,7.5,Our floor had  major water damage apparently from the AC.  The floor was buckled in an up position about 2 to 3 inches high.  We had to place a stool over it to keep from tripping on it.  Big inconvenience.  Fortunately nobody actually fell.,Location was great.
Bricco Suites,Barbara,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 27  2017,9.6,noisy neighbors and loud wooden stairs outside our room,unique. renovated clean and comfortable property;  bed was very comfortable. furnishings were first class
Bricco Suites,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 24  2017,8.8,1. While we had a stove and fridge. we didn't have adequate cookware or utensils to cook anything besides boiling water for instant oatmeal. 2. We don't mind stairs. but if you have trouble with them. this isn't the place for you.3. Parking and public transportation options are both far enough away to make schlepping luggage a hassle. We ended up dropping off our luggage at the property. then returning our rental car early and using public transportation to get back and forth to the airport. We saved ourselves the expensive parking fees and we didn't have to walk any further with luggage when it was time to go home.4. It's a good location in a major city so it's expensive. though reasonable relative to other properties listed in the area.5. Check-in was a bit of a challenge to find (it's in the restaurant at street level). When locating the property. look for the restaurant. not anything that looks like a hotel.,The location was great for accessing local attractions (it's right on the Freedom Trail). In the middle of Little Italy. it is surrounded by great restaurant options.  The suite was basically a one bedroom apartment. with plenty of space for two people to rattle around for a couple of days (while not out touring). The bed was comfortable. the double-headed shower was cool. and it was reasonably quiet for being in the middle of a busy area.
Bricco Suites,Michael,United States of America,70 Reviews,July 18  2017,9.6,The only thing that needs improvement is the internet. It was inconsistent. But this was minor compared to all the good things this place has.,Great location. wonderful suite. great hot water and AC. comfy bet. nice towels and toiletries nice s helpful management.
Bricco Suites,Sean P,Switzerland,50 Reviews,July 12  2017,7.5,the hosts are apparently mainly running a busy restaurant and - that is a personal impression - do not seem to be very keen about the guests staying at their rental suites. communication seems to be kept to an absolute minimum.,two bedroom suites offer an ideal accommodation for parties of more than two. the rooms are spacious and the beds comfortable. if the north end is the area you want to stay in. bricco suites is pefectly located. good value for money (for boston standards).
Bricco Suites,Sean P,Switzerland,50 Reviews,July 12  2017,7.5,air conditioning in the specific room (1 double bed) was incredibly loud. windows facing an unpleasant courtyard.,spacious rooms and flats centrally located in boston's lively north end with comfortable beds.
Bricco Suites,Daniel,United States of America,1 review,June 30  2017,9.2,There's no elevator.  There are people help to carry luggage upstairs when you arrive but when leaving you are on your own. Windows are not well sound proof. you can hear noises from outside (restaurant. street) but every thing calm down after 11:00pm.,Strange (located above the restaurant) but great location with lots of restaurants around within walking distance.  The suite is spacious.comfortable and clean.  There's room service (cleaning) every day.  Towels are super soft :).
Bricco Suites,Gail,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 25  2017,7.5,I thought the studio had a "kitchen". All it has is a refrigerator. a sink and plates and silverware. Unfortunately there was no microwave or stove to heat up food. That was the reason we chose it over a hotel so we were disappointed about that. Also the wifi did not work at all for my iPad- only my phone. That was a bummer. Weak wifi.,Awesome location! Wonderful restaurants. deli and bakery below suites. Very clean. comfortable. and quiet. So much to do within walking distance. Best Italian food I've ever had!
Bricco Suites,Antonella,United States of America,1 review,June 20  2017,9.2,No elevator.Rooms a little bit noisy at the first floor due to a restaurant just below.,The accommodation is very spacious and comfortable.The location is excellent. close to restaurants and main touristic spots.
Bricco Suites,Barbara,United States of America,1 review,June 17  2017,8.8,It was a surprise to find not even a few pots or pans. no dishes. the barest silverware in the apartment. This isn't good! This is the one thing I think needs attention right away-- the stove is not of great use without anything else! In this situation. a microwave would have been appreciated. The other issue is the noise. and because of the structure of the building this is harder to deal with I am sure. One of our three nights. there was apparently a dinner party on the second floor landing dining room and the LOUD sounds went on for hours. Also. I could hear entire conversations by the family in the next-door apartment (who had ibuprofen! went to leave for dinner!) through the connecting door. Quiet. it is not.,The location is absolutely terrific. Step outside and you're surrounded by numerous Italian restaurants and pastry shops. with Freedom Trail sites all around plus the harbor an easy walk. We walked so much and enjoyed the neighborhood. The apartment itself is nicely furnished and the hosts upon greeting and departure quite helpful.
Bricco Suites,Deane,United Kingdom,14 Reviews,June 11  2017,6.3,Well this is a difficult one. After 7 weeks touring through the USA and Canada we stayed in various types of accommodation. As Boston was going to be our last stop we thought we would blow our accommodation budget to end our trip on a high. For us $1080 for four nights was a lot of money and more than twice what we had paid elsewhere.The appartment itself was very stylish however to get there we had to drag our bags up 40 odd twisty and narrow stairs as a lift is not available. Of course we also had to take them down again.Once in we were pleased to see a kitchen. as I said we'd travelled for 7 weeks so to have a kitchen where we could give restaurants and diners a miss occasionally and eat in was good. However the kitchen consided of a kettle and hob. a coffee machine. two mugs. two side plates. two forks and two knives. No microwave. no pans or bowls.Wifi at the best was patchy having to go down to the restaurant that owns the apartments to ask them to reboot it several times wasn't ideal and even when connected was slow.When the apartments were built I guess noise insulation was missed of the spec. Conversations could be clearly heard from the above room along with footsteps.Now maybe I've missed what these apartments are about. they promise a lot and could be great but for us it was probably the most dissapointing of the thirteen different  accommodations that we stayed in although the most expensive.,Stylish room in a good area for coffee shops and restaurants. Big double shower. comfortable bed. We were able to leave bags at the property after checkout and the owner very kindly ordered us a taxi to the airport.
Bricco Suites,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,June 10  2017,7.1,I called the day before we were to stay at Bricco Suites and talked to a man that said he would be there a little before noon to get us to our room.  We got there at noon only to find out that he wouldn't be there until 3 pm.  Luckily a women at the restaurant took our carry on luggage so we could to something in Boston.  She was helpful and found us the directions to the tour buses.  We got back a little after 3 pm and then got in our room.  We never heard from anyone during the 2 days we stayed there.  When we left we dropped the keys in the box which we thought you must do when you check out even though we were not told what to do.The bathroom was small...when you opened the shower door it hit the sink.,Clean and modern.  Very good location.
Bricco Suites,Rachel,Australia,3 Reviews,May 26  2017,7.1,location was on a very busy street. noise at night was terrible.  and then early morning the same with trucks and delivery drivers and garbage collections.room had a kitchen. there was four plates and a kettle.  NO cooking utensils AT ALL.  Seems very strange to offer a kitchen but not stock it with simple utensils.,location to sightseeing in area.
Bricco Suites,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,May 23  2017,10,The suites are housed in fully renovated buildings. but since they are old buildings. no elevator.  We don't mind walking up stairs. but if you do you may want a room on the second floor.,Excellent location in the North End.    We had a two bedroom suite which reminded us of staying in a high-end European apartment.     This will be our new home away from home when working in Boston.  Much better than the equally. or more expensive name brand hotels where we typically stay.
Bricco Suites,Lynn,United States of America,9 Reviews,May 17  2017,9.6,No parking. however the garage was just a few blocks away. 3rd floor was fine for me but I think some people would not like the stairs and the fact that there is no elevator. Also travelers should be advised that check in is handled by the host at the restaurant.,Loved the location! Loved the sweet. Lots of room. comfy bed. great shower. Restaurant down stairs was amazing!
Bricco Suites,MikaGoes,Philippines,6 Reviews,May 14  2017,7.9,The stairs are a little narrow. Walls are thin so you can hear everyone coming up the stairs and your neighboring apartment.,Easy access. quick check in and check out. fireplace in the living room area and comfy beds. The area has plenty of dining options and the best cannolis ever. Walking distance to the Quincy Market and the Boston Public Market and it's along the Freedom Trail.
Bricco Suites,Elizabeth,United States of America,1 review,May 6  2017,7.9,No living room as shown in pics. Difficult to get to from street. No lobby.Had to check in in restaurant.Had to walk through a restaurant with luggage to get to room. No elevator.,Very clean. Beds were comfy.
Bricco Suites,Søren,Denmark,14 Reviews,May 5  2017,6.7,Basic rooms. no view from windows. noisy due to thin wallsCheck-in at the restaurant. which is not ideal in crowded hoursWas not able to contact front-desk/staff outside restaurant opening hours,Perfect location on Hanover Street with plenty of dining optionsClean rooms. ok wifi (although no password required. which some devices have security problems with)Friendly staff
Bricco Suites,David,Australia,9 Reviews,May 4  2017,4.6,This NOT a hotel. It is a loft room above a restaurant. The noise from the restaurant stops you sleeping until 1am.,The location is central to the italian quarter
Bricco Suites,Rujie,United States of America,9 Reviews,May 2  2017,8.8,Staying on the second floor. need to enter through the restaurant on the first floor and deal with noise at night.,Easy access to green and orange line. High-end facilities.
Bricco Suites,Marnie,Canada,2 Reviews,April 20  2017,10,I wish there had been a microwave.,The location was excellent as well as the size of the suite.  When we were asked to be moved to a quieter suite our request was addressed almost immediately. Thanks Michael
Bricco Suites,Tracy,United States of America,1 review,April 20  2017,8.8,The pillows were just plain awful. It also would have been nice to have a microwave in the room.,The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept on.  The location was ideal-very convenient to subway. and resteraunts everywhere!
Bricco Suites,Theresa,United States of America,1 review,April 19  2017,9.6,Parking.    That's it.    And in bid city.    That's to be expected.   Great place,Location location location.    This was in great spot walking distance to all the attractions.    I highly recommend it.    The staff downside was only not being typical hotel.   U check in at restaurant and rarely interact with them.    However room was cleaned daily and was beautiful.   We faced a brick wall.   That was OK.    We were in busy location.   I was able to sleep.   Will be back if Boston calls again.    Recommending to my friends.   And u!!!
Bricco Suites,Phyllis,United States of America,3 Reviews,April 10  2017,7.1,One of the first things that should have been listed is that there was no elevator. Our group was in their 60s and 70s and our luggage was taken up the stairs for us but there was no one available when we left early in the morning.  Only two chairs in the suite.  Window in front bedroom needs to be adjusted so it can be shut all the way.,Clean and bright. Beds were very comfortable.
Bricco Suites,Daniel,United States of America,1 review,March 27  2017,10,Did not have access to wifi. maybe should be posted in room how to access,Loved the location. Bed was very comfortableService was excellent. took good care of us.
Bricco Suites,Christine,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,March 19  2017,9.2,Because the property is in a busy street. sometimes the noise outside can be audibly heard).,location was superb. Easy access to most places and very close to the airport. the staff was nice enough to keep my luggage after I checked out.
Bricco Suites,Christine,United States of America,1 review,March 13  2017,9.6,You have to walk up several flights of stairs to get to the rooms. And the checkin was a little confusing because it is in a restaurant. The kitchen did not have and pots or pans. There also was no microwave or toaster.,The location was right in little Italy close to everything. The staff were super friendly and helpful. The rooms were very large and clean. We had to reserve a roll away and we're able to fit it on one of the bedrooms.  Also. We arrived early - around 11:30 - and they were super accommodating and even let us check into our room early. Even considering the negatives. I would definitely stay here again.
Bricco Suites,Francine,United States of America,2 Reviews,January 24  2017,7.1,Room was a little dirty - fingerprints on walls/doors. Room was on multiple flights of steps with no elevator.

Bricco Suites,James,United States of America,1 review,January 24  2017,9.6,Kitchenette did not have pots/pans to cook with. Did not have a microwave. but manager was quick to provide one and anything we needed.  A couch in living area would have been nice. but table and chairs were good.,We were in Boston for a procedure at Boston Children's Hospital.  Very comfortable post operative recovery space. Walkable area.  We could easily get out for short walks near the water or Quincy Market. Though near busy area. pretty sound proof.  Manager was quick to assist us with requests.
Bricco Suites,Couple,United States of America,9 Reviews,December 26  2016,10,N/A,Such a romantic place. perfect location for us. got free room upgrade . bakery was amazing. thinking cup coffee shop right across the street. everything within walking distance.

Bricco Suites,Michael,United States of America,1 review,December 9  2016,9.6,N/A,You cannot beat the hospitality or the location. if you want to be in the North End.  Michael. the GM. is very welcoming. friendly and accommodating to our needs.
Bricco Suites,Anonymous,Canada,36 Reviews,December 5  2016,9.2,Be prepared for lots of stairs. check in is at the restaurant on the ground level and that part of the process is not clear or signed. weak wifi signal,Location in the North End was great. spacious room. comfortable bed. great shower and amenities

Bricco Suites,Nj,United States of America,2 Reviews,November 22  2016,9.6,The trumpet player could have gone away.  The room faced the street and the noise was uncomfortable; especially the trumpet player!,The shower was amazing - didn't want to get out!  The kitchen/living room area was very spacious and comfortable.
Bricco Suites,Mary,United States of America,3 Reviews,November 15  2016,9.6,Wasn't able to use the fireplace. Would have liked some directions.

Bricco Suites,Ron,United States of America,1 review,November 2  2016,8.3,The windows wouldn't close all the way so it was a bit noisy.  No elevator.,Great location and within walking to many great restaurants and historical sites.
Bricco Suites,Travelismylife1109,United States of America,1 review,October 26  2016,9.6,The only issue was the noise on the street. We could hear the cars and the garbage trucks going by along with the massive amount of people who walk around at night. But that's what happens when you stay in the city. If you don't like commotion or night life. I would not recommend this place for you. Or. just bring ear plugs.,The location was excellent. Better than expected. actually. We were 350 feet away from Paul Revere's House and walking distance to the Old North Church. the Aquarium. Quincy Markets. Faneuil Hall. and much more. I was a little skeptical at first. because we were located right above a restaurant. but it was a beautiful "hotel." It was more like an apartment. Plenty of space. It was updated and very clean. I would definitely stay here again next time I go to Boston.
Bricco Suites,Christiana,United States of America,1 review,October 25  2016,7.9,The kitchen was half a kitchen. Meaning a mini fridge stocked with soda and water (that are charged to you after your stay) 2 stove top burners. no oven.,I liked the location (little italy) and the building setup. The layout of the suites provide the most privacy as possible. Sky lights. Double headed shower. Heat lamp in the bathroom.
Bricco Suites,Modesto,Panama,4 Reviews,October 25  2016,6.7,No elevator. you have to climb 36 steps going up and 36 going down. no lobby.entrance is through restaurant. You SHOULD mention that there is no elevator,N/A
Bricco Suites,Roger,United States of America,5 Reviews,October 21  2016,7.1,no staff on duty - you are on your own - no one to provide an invoice - no one to call a cab - no room service - no one to check you out - have to walk thru busy dining room to get to room.,excellent location in North End - very clean and comfortable - good beds
Bricco Suites,Trevor,United States of America,1 review,October 19  2016,9.6,Nothing. The place was absolutely perfect for our stay.,Where to begin? Assistance with bags up the stairs was a godsend. and it was provided cheerfully. The room was clean and modern and the bed was very comfortable. And the location! The location of the hotel was perfect. right in the middle of it all in the north end. Bonus: it's above the Bricco restaurant. which was outstanding as well!
Bricco Suites,Alice,United States of America,1 review,October 19  2016,3.3,I stayed here with a friend at the end of September.  The rate was expensive ($437) but we splurged because of the location. and because it offered two separate bedrooms.  The room we were in backed right onto the freeway. with no double pane windows or  blackout shades to block out the light and noise.  Unfortunately we didn't notice this until it was time to go to sleep. and realized we could hear this strange roaring sound only a few feet away. Wondering what it was. we lifted up the slats of the blinds to see that we were directly over the freeway - the hotel backs onto the spot where the freeway passes under the tunnel (the Big Dig) though you'd never guess it from the front of the building.  This wouldn't be a problem if they had blackout shades. or double pane windows to block out the noise and light - which you would expect for over $400/night - but they don't.  Needless to say. we couldn't sleep. and felt the rate was excessive for this level of inconvenience. When we complained to "Michael" about the situation on checkout. he said they had complaints from other guests as well. and he would speak with his manager about a partial refund of the room rate. No one followed up with us. and Michael has not responded to any of our follow up emails or calls to date.  Though the location right in the North End is prime. don't be fooled - this is not a full service hotel. just a few rooms above a restaurant.  It's not worth the outrageous rate they are charging and don't expect to sleep if you do stay there. They are aware of this issue and have no plans to do anything about it.,N/A
Bricco Suites,Brenda,United States of America,1 review,October 17  2016,8.3,No microwave. no paper toweling or ability to clean a dish.  No real coffee pot or ability to make tea properly.  No place to sit for four persons other than 2 stools and a couch. No dining table.  Bring ear plugs for weekend crowds down below.  38 stairs from ground to get to apartment.,The shower. The beds.  The location.  The cleanliness.
Bricco Suites,Deborah,United States of America,1 review,October 17  2016,10,Checking in was a bit of a challenge because we arrived after 7:00 and the offices were closed.  Someone from the restaurant came outside and noticed us waiting by the office door. and we checked in through the restaurant.  It would be helpful if that information was shared with us when we booked the room.  We were a bit panicky as the office phone wasn't being answered and we didn't know what to do.  Now we know and we will still stay here again.,The room was very comfortable and spacious.  The location can't be beat. because you are in the middle of Hanover Street. filled with many restaurants and bars. We had reservations in the restaurant below. which is one of our favorites.  It didn't disappoint!  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.
Bricco Suites,Lm,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 16  2016,5.8,need a curtain or drapes for the living area.  bedroom rather small,bed was comfortable.  lots of stairs to get to room and kind of awkward location going through the restaurant to get to room.
Bricco Suites,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 13  2016,5.0,The rooms were nothing special especially for the price.  They weren't real well maintained. There was no view.  The worst part was the horrible smell.  It was supposedly from the bread cooking but it was nauseating for me and it was very strong.,The location was great.
Bricco Suites,Chris,United Kingdom,17 Reviews,October 11  2016,8.3,N/A,High spec spacious apartment in the heart of Little Italy. located above a busy restaurant of the same name. one of many Italian restaurants on Hanover Street. Convenient access for all the attractions that Boston has to offer.
Bricco Suites,Mark,United States of America,1 review,October 11  2016,10,No microwave - but not a deal killer.,The location was within easy walking distance to historic Boston.  Right on the Freedom Trail and two blocks from Paul Revere's home.  In the heart of the Italian food district.  Clean. modern rooms.  We stayed in a two bedroom apartment that was perfect.
Bricco Suites,Milly,United States of America,1 review,October 10  2016,7.5,Loud traffic noise at night!,Nice and comfortable. Clean. Great meal at the Bricco restaurant. Located within walking distance to many restaurants and sights in the North End.
Bricco Suites,Gerald,United States of America,1 review,September 27  2016,8.3,I didn't know there was no elevator and 56 stairs in a semi spiral staircase to get up to the room.  The internet service was spotty. at least in our room. and not secured.,It's right in the heart of Boston's North End Little Italy restaurant district.  The rooms (kitchenette. living room. bedroom and bath) were all very spacious and neat.
Bricco Suites,Nathan,United States of America,1 review,September 27  2016,8.3,There needs to be some place to sit in the kitchen. which is the only place to gather in front of the TV.  There were seats at the small kitchen table. but the space needed a small couch for sure.  Also. the place was sooooo loud! Slept terrible each night bc the traffic outside was very loud. and the restaurant staff outside in the hallway were really loud into all hours of the night (4am).  And lastly. the rooms needed curtains to block out the morning light.  It was super bright the second the sun came up.  The location almost makes us want to book here again. but the lack of comfort and noise makes that questionable,The location was perfect!  We walked everywhere from the Bricco. and also got on the T subway a few times. which was close.  So many cool bars. great restaurants. and the wharf so close by.  We were right off the Freedom Trail too.  Great spot
Bricco Suites,Eric,United States of America,1 review,September 18  2016,9.2,Need hooks inside bedroom and bath doors.  A sofa would have been nice.  No dresser in second bedroom.,Location. location. location. Very nice rooms!   Restaurants were great!  Bread was legendary!  Close to historical sites.  Good access to the "T".  Staff was very responsive!
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Skip,United States of America,11 Reviews,October 24  2017,8.3,They need to improve pre-arrival communications about arrival and building entry.  I felt like they weren't going to trust me with the building entry info until the very last minute.  If they are going to be running a property like this (no front desk. self-check in. etc.) then they need to change their technology to digital with one-time-use passcodes. etc.  The property was great. the price was decent. but they have to accommodate travelers better who do not arrive during business hours.,A very nice small apartment. more than I needed for 1 night. but very comfortable and well appointed.
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,October 20  2017,10,N/A,Great location. lovely apartment. very clean and comfy. Staff were really helpful and welcoming. Two Green line T stops (Longwood and Brigham Circle stops) are 2 minutes walk in either direction so it's ideally situated for scooting about town. Both the Mission Grill and Squealing Pig pubs are good for eating out nearby and there is a market plus a Walgreens nearby too. Would definitely stay in this apartment again.
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Anonymous,United Kingdom,15 Reviews,October 19  2017,9.2,The office wasn't manned when we left on Saturday morning. Trying to find a taxi in heavy rain proved difficult! With hindsight. we could have asked them for the number of a taxi the previous day - would have been helpful if they had included this in their documentation.,Very good sized room with full cooking facilities. Very comfortable. large bed. Near to supermarkets and local restaurants. Trolley into downtown Boston very close.
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Carol,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 1  2017,9.6,Parking is impossible / extremely costly nearby so we took our hired car back to the airport before getting a taxi to the airport.Limited reception hours (9am-5pm Mon-Fri. 11am-4pm Sat) make it difficult to check in outside of these hours or leaving cases after checkout if you have a late flight.,Very helpful staff and excellent accommodation. Fully equipped apartment with kitchenette and sitting area - would be great for a longer stay.Easy access to trolley stops - about 20 mins to centre of Boston.
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Michele,United States of America,1 review,September 30  2017,3.8,Was not handicapped friendly. no front desk. No luggage. rental office only open between 9 am Thru 5 pm. this place was an apartment house that misleads consumers to believe that it's a hotel.  No hotel staff. no restaurant. and parking in an alley way.,Nothing
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Maureen,United States of America,1 review,September 29  2017,10,Too much light came through the mini blinds at night. Made it difficult to sleep.  Moderate amount  of city noise. so I used "white noise fan" on my phone.  No amenities like hotels such  as ice.  There was a VERY small ice tray in the freezer.  Would be nice to have more room in the bathroom to lay your toiletries.,Easy access to the T train – green line.  Nice sized shower. Bed was very comfortable.
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Andrea,Ireland,15 Reviews,September 26  2017,9.6,We loved everything,We had a lovely stay. The apartment is gorgeous so clean and beautifully decorated. It is a good size and has a separate kitchen with everything you could need for your stay. We really felt at home there and cannot fault the place at all. If we went to Boston again we would stay here

Also appreciated the bottles of water put in the fridge for our arrival! Nice touch! Also staff were very friendly &amp; accommodating. We weren't flying until the evening but was able to leave our bags in the office for the day. saving us a lot of hassle! Thank you!
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Ed,United Kingdom,1 review,September 10  2017,9.2,No staff on  Saturday therefore we had to post keys through letterbox on our departure.,Clean.well equipped apartment close to transport links. Great service from office staff.
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Begoña,France,1 review,August 14  2017,9.6,N/A,The apparment was very nice and comfortable. Ideal if you are travelling alone. Very well connected with public transport to go to the centre or even walking.
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,William C Brown,United States of America,4 Reviews,August 9  2017,10,Absolutely nothing the location was perfect the room was perfect everything was perfect.,I have stayed at many hotels but it never felt like home. The Baldwin feels like home away from home I loved every minute of it and so did my fiance.
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Kimberly,United States of America,1 review,July 15  2017,9.6,I actually had no idea this was an Airbnb until I arrived at the door.  I was delayed about 20 minutes in getting my keys. but overall it was ok.  A resident saw me and explained the process. then I spoke with the manager of the office who was great!,The apartment was excellent. staff accommodating. building residents very nice.
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Ann-michelle,United States of America,1 review,July 11  2017,10,Honestly. I really liked it...I don't have anything to say. here :),My room was beautiful and the staff was incredibly helpful! There is a little binder in the room that detailed some FAQs about getting around Boston and some other dining/drink options. It was very helpful! I really enjoyed my stay!
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Ashley,United States of America,1 review,June 27  2017,10,N/A,I loved the fact that it was an apartment instead of just a hotel room with a full kitchen for use with provided utensils.  The green E line ran right in front of the location.  The natural light in the room was great. but the real kicker for me was the shower with adjustable water pressure.
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Kenneth,Canada,2 Reviews,June 20  2017,10,Metro attendant sent me to the wrong Longwood stop on the Green Line...not the hotel's fault. Why there are two Longwood stops on the Green Line is beyond me.,Staff was exceptional.
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Michelle,United States of America,1 review,May 28  2017,8.8,The stove is gas and would not light,The apartment was very cute and very clean. The T was easily accessible and there are a few pubs and food mart within walking distance.
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Ravi,United States of America,4 Reviews,May 19  2017,8.8,Parking is an issue in the area. The property needs to give you a list of parking garages in the area and rates. The lot they recommended was a 10 min walk ( luckily good weather) but cost me $42/day. Don't know if it was the bed or my sedentary lifestyle and long drive. I had a terrible back ache when I woke up. It cleared up when I got back home.,N/A
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Linda,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,May 18  2017,9.6,The room blinds were thin. so a lot of light came in - I bought an eye mask after the first night.  Also. having a kitchenette with no door means the noise of the fridge turning on and off can be disturbing.,The apartment was really lovely. with wood floors and orginal features.  I enjoyed having my own little kitchen and shopping at the nearby supermarket (I'm vegan. and appreciated how much choice was available).  The room was spotless and the bed very comfortable. with fresh-smelling linens.  The tram stop was 5 minutes walk away and it was easy to get around Boston from this location. The local information provided by the venue in a folder was very helpful. and complemented my Lonely Planet guide.
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Joyce,Canada,2 Reviews,March 29  2017,8.3,A reception desk should be open on the week-ends and later than 5:00 p.m. in the evenings.No one answered the doorbell on Sunday.

The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Anne,United Kingdom,1 review,February 11  2017,9.2,The location was great for me being close to a hospital that I was attached to. Otherwise. for most purposes. such as tourism the T or other transport would be required.,Very warm comfortable apartment. The staff were very helpful.
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Rohair,United States of America,2 Reviews,February 11  2017,9.6,I could nitpick and say that the cable channel offerings were pretty slim but really. at this price. that's getting greedy.  It's just one of the nicest places I've stayed and was an amazing deal.,Amazing place to stay for the price.  It's like having your own very large. studio apartment in the middle of Boston. complete with a full kitchen. bathroom and foyer.  Really beautifully furnished and comfortable. with lots of charm.
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Stella,United States of America,2 Reviews,February 8  2017,10,Not a thing,The best location. price. staff. decor. cleanliness. etc. What a deal! I'll always return to this place and will recommend it to others

The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,PRC64,United States of America,5 Reviews,December 28  2016,9.6,Parking is a little bit of an issue ( as with most cities) We used a garage that was a 10 minute walk away. so certainly it was manageable.,The Manager and staff were very friendly and helpful. Very welcoming! Charming building tastefully decorated. Modern fixtures in an older building. proving that old does not have to be bad. All the amenities one could want; full sized refrigerator. stove. toaster. toaster oven. coffee maker in the kitchenette. The room was tastefully decorated. very clean and comfortable. Nice bed linens and pillows for a good nights rest. Convenient to all the medical facilities. food. etc. And the price was very reasonable. Highly recommended!!!
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,December 15  2016,10,There was a smell of cigarette smoke in the front hallway when I first arrived.,The full-service studio apartment was beautiful and extremely convenient walk to the School of Public Health and surrounding area.  There are many places to eat and a grocery store nearby.
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Ignacio L,United States of America,14 Reviews,December 4  2016,9.6,N/A,Excellent room at an excellent price. We arrived late at night and left very early. The staff was extremely helpful in every way. Will most probably return on my next visit to Boston.
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Sara,United Kingdom,38 Reviews,October 31  2016,9.2,The heating is communal building heating which means you cannot control it yourself - and it is steam heat which means there is a bit of noise. It wasn't a problem when we were visiting late October. There is just enough but not ample crockery and cookware. Occasional noise from car park next door or floor above but mostly wonderfully quiet.,Great spacious accommodation. Well planned furniture with a comfortable bed. Clean. Friendly and helpful staff (including maintainance team) available Monday to Friday). Good shower. Ample hot water. Provision of hairdryer. The kitchen is well equipped with fridge and freezer. microwave. coffee maker. hob and oven (use of washer/dryer within building). Good security. Near subway stop (Longwood Medical stop on green line). Supermarket. restaurants and bars nearby. NOT having towels changed every day (so unnecessary!) and being left to ourselves excepting if we visited the office. We would stay again.
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Suzanne,United States of America,5 Reviews,October 27  2016,10,Room met all our expectations.,Room was. while not modern. charming.  Square footage makes it sound teeny but more than enough room for two people.  Staff was friendly and so helpful even coming outside on a winters day to make sure we were heading in the right direction upon departure.
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Roger,United Kingdom,31 Reviews,October 24  2016,10,N/A,On arrival the staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was tastfefully decorated and fully appointed. The location was excellent - right on the metro to get to all locations and attractions. All in all I would recommend the Baldwin to everyone
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Elizabeth,United Kingdom,1 review,August 18  2016,10,Our only minor problem was that the double glazing wasn't as effective as we'd expect in eliminating some noises.,The room was very well appointed . with everything you'd need. We really liked the bed and the air - conditioner was a blessing.
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Pandas,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 28  2016,8.8,The office is only open from 9-5 so if you get into town other times. let them know early or contact the office as soon as you know.  The ac in the room was inadequate (note I have a medical condition that requires that I can control room temperature so it may be fine for you).  This is particularly problematic when the sun comes up because the room gets direct sunlight in the morning and you are on the top floor.,Beautiful apartment in a very cute building.   The decor in the apartment is monochromatic yet cozy.  The entire apartment is flooded with light in the mornings.  Office is only open in business hours. but at least they are on premises and the staff is very responsive to emails sent through Booking.com.
The Baldwin at Longwood Medical Area,Dmitrii,Russia,3 Reviews,April 4  2016,9.6,N/A,The apartment was close to the metro station.coffee places and a supermarket. Great staff. Room was stylish. clean. with a very comfy bed. The kitchen was well equipped.

Global Luxury Suites at Massachusetts General,Candy,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,October 30  2017,8.3,Just a small gripe - No toaster - but can use the oven. Some staining to carpet in the entrance and dining area - a little off putting on arrival. but generally clean and tidy.,Spacious central apartment right opposite MGH - safe. well lit area.  24 hour front desk concierge. Well maintained common areas. Easy walk to T station - 3 line options. Charles St very close - lots of independent shops. Has a washing machine &amp; dryer. Super comfortable beds. Whole Foods store close by. Plenty of spare towels. Great views! Will definitely book again when planning a trip to Boston.

Global Luxury Suites at Massachusetts General,Alexis,United States of America,2 Reviews,March 15  2017,10,For having been in an apartment with 3 men. vents in the bathroom would have been a life saver.At no point was the details of cleaning or maintenance mentioned. if the stay had been for longer. I am unsure if we would have had to clean our own linen and towels or not.,Loved that there was around the clock assistance at the front desk. The place had two bedrooms and a sofa bed. There were two bathrooms. two queen sized beds and two TVs. The property provided us with some basic necessities (shampoo. conditioner. soap. eating utensils. water bottles) as well as things that most hotels wouldn't offer unless a suite of some kind was booked.  The location was easy for an Uber to find and was a five minute walk from public transportation. The room's were tidy and spacious enough to enjoy walking room. The bathrooms we had almost too much space to use. but definitely not complaining about that! The bill was split between 4 people. who fit comfortably in this space and were able to rotate bathroom use. The staff was willing and ready to assist during our stay there. as well as  the days leading up to the stay.
Global Luxury Suites at Massachusetts General,David,Canada,4 Reviews,February 10  2017,8.3,Lived there for thirteen days with family. At the second week I called customer service to deliver some tissue paper and cleaner. No one helped. I called four times again after that. the staff just kept saying that they would send as soon as possible. but never did. until the day before checking out . the customer office sent an apology email for not to deliver. Awful service.,The location of hotel is good. The apartment size is perfect for 2-3 persons.
Global Luxury Suites at Massachusetts General,Linda,United States of America,1 review,January 12  2017,8.3,We were never able to get the heating system adjusted quite right. but that wasn't such a big deal.  It would have been nice to have a blanket for the sofa bed and not have had to ask for it to be delivered. The front door could benefit from some additional stripping to reduce hallway noise.,This location could not be more convenient to Massachusetts General Hospital.  It is located directly across the street from the Wang building and the family surgical waiting room. When we requested additional linens. they arrived within 24 hours (delivery time was impacted by inclement weather). There are many conveniences nearby: CVS. Whole Foods. JC Pace. red line MGH stop. etc. The apartment looks just as the photos depict.

Global Luxury Suites at Massachusetts General,Mukachilima,Zambia,1 review,December 28  2015,7.5,We needed two sets of keys and only got one working set. This was a business trip and we had very different schedules. Having only one set of keys was a significant inconvenience. It made it very difficult for us in terms of coordinating our movements and access to the apartment.,Very nice staff. clean apartment. and convenient location.
Global Luxury Suites at Massachusetts General,Anonymous,Ireland,10 Reviews,December 9  2015,9.6,Tax and a $100 dollar cleaning fee were in the small print that I only saw after I had booked.,Very spacious and comfortable.

Global Luxury Suites at Massachusetts General,Thersea,United States of America,1 review,November 12  2015,4.2,Before booking. web site said the reservation was cancellable.

W Boston,William,Jersey,6 Reviews,October 23  2017,7.9,The breakfast is expensive and the service very slow.,The staff at the Front Desk were very friendly and helpful with what to do and see and also with restaurant booking reservations.
W Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,October 20  2017,7.5,There was an "anti-noise" device plugged into each of two sockets to compensate for the fact they are in a noisy road. In fact. this emits itself a loud roaring sound. When unplugged. things were fine. The road noise was not bad at all (we were on the 12th floor). One of the senior staff kindly refunded a breakfast bill given this and another issue (cordless phone by the bed wouldn't stop beeping through the night). The restaurant and room service were extremely expensive. There was a slight sense too that some of the decor (wood-appearance veneer on cabinets. shower curtain not panel ) was a bit cheap and scuffed given the price.,Staff were great - thoughtful. friendly and clearly dedicated to running it well.Decor and atmosphere of front lounge area welcoming and stylish. Location is very good.
W Boston,Maria,United States of America,1 review,October 20  2017,10,N/A,When i got to the hotel the front desk was very helpful and made my check in easy. The car service was excellent. My room was upgraded which was very nice considering i was celebrating my boyfriend's birthday. The room was spectacular. And i enjoyed the breakfast in the morning.
W Boston,Jw,United Kingdom,1 review,October 14  2017,4.6,When we arrived we were met by a unfriendly doorman and it was so loud due to the bar that we could barely hear the person at reception. Each day the room was made up "apparently" but barely even folded the sheets. towels weren't folded etc. We have stayed in lots of hotels over the years and had recently stayed at the Loews Boston which was a far far better experience with far friendlier staff.,Food was awesome.
W Boston,James,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 14  2017,9.6,It wasn't a family friendly hotel.  If we had younger children we would have felt out of place with them walking through the lobby and different parts of the hotel.,The hotel was clean and comfortable.  It was located right near Emerson College which we were visiting for the weekend.
W Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 25  2017,10,The only reason why I'm rating fair is because I've reserved a room and paid for it on May 30th. When we checked in on September 22nd they told us they over sold their king bed rooms. How inconvenient and unacceptable!!!,N/A
W Boston,Andra,United States of America,1 review,September 18  2017,4.6,We asked for a quiet room but there is a line up of cars and throngs of partiers that carried on until 3am out front on the sidewalk and in their valet parking area apparently every weekend night. The staff optimally told us they would be gone by midnight. which was entirely false. We were on the right floor and even with the windows shut they kept us awake all night. My husband finally called down to concierge at 3am to complain and they said the police were starting to clear them out. When we came down to front desk in the am. we again complained to them. and the manager said the staff person should never have told us the partiers would be gone by midnight as that's never true so she apologized for the misleading information and that they tried to give us a quiet room on the eighth floor and that it was a better room than the one they originally had us in! We said it was the worst night ever in a hotel anywhere and we were going to dispute the charge on our credit card. She eventually said she could give us $100 off our stay and we took that begrudgingly. but will NEVER stay there again.,It's a pretty hotel with nice decor.
W Boston,Claudia,United States of America,1 review,September 11  2017,10,Our room was missed one night to clean (we didn't care about the bed. but we needed some supplies).   It's OK. not a big deal.,Great location to visit Boston.  Room was spacious and modern.  Overall staff was professional and friendly.
W Boston,Butrint,United States of America,12 Reviews,August 31  2017,6.7,I did request early check-in. and even though I received a confirmation e-mail for that. when I arrived. the room was not ready. I did not make it a big deal. as I could wait another 1:30 hours until (3:00 pm) for regular check-in. but they told me that their check-in time is 4:00 pm. and that it is not their fault and they don't know why Booking.com says that their check-in time is 3:00 pm. Instead of apologizing and working to get my room ready. they said that I can check-in right away if I pay an upgrade fee for a room which is ready. I felt very disappointed since we are talking about a $500/night Hotel and while I waited there. I saw that they were doing this to almost every customer - offering opportunity for upgrade at an extra cost. This is terrible customer service. especially for a 5 start Hotel.The unpleasant experience continued as I told them I will come back at 3:00 PM no matter what and I want my room ready. They can talk to Booking.com or whoever they want. After I left. they called me just after 10 mins to tell me that my room was ready. So apparently. the room was ready from the beginning but they tried their best to charge me extra for that.During the whole time. the receptionist. Pamela. wasn't polite at all. When she handed me the key. didn't even care to tell me where the elevator was. what was the number of my room or which floor was it. As the same building is used as a residential building as well. I only figured it out later that you had to scan your key room for the elevator to work. On top of all this. they even sent to my room the wrong bags. and I had again and again to call them to come and get somebody's else bags and give me my bags. This was the experience I got at a $500/night hotel.,Location.
W Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,August 6  2017,4.2,Attitude of reception staff was rude. location of hotel was noisy. dirty and grubby. hotel furnishings were tired and dated and for what it was supposed to be. rather overpriced. Wouldn't go back.,N/A

W Boston,Melissa,United States of America,1 review,July 12  2017,9.2,A set of expensive makeup brushes was stolen. Obviously I should not have left them in the room but when I called to inquire about them. the polite girl at the desk informed me that "nothing has been turned in or reported". Very unfortunate that their staff is dishonest. I even left a tip for the cleaning person. : (,The room was very clean and comfortable. I like the modern style of the W and usually enjoy staying there.
W Boston,Anonymous,Canada,1 review,July 10  2017,10,The parking rates are outrageous ($59 USD/day for valet). but this is for all of Boston. not just this hotel.,Great location. very convenient for Boston Commons. subway and good restos. Hotel was very nicely appointed with great products. Wish we had time to use Bliss Spa!
W Boston,Nancy,Netherlands,3 Reviews,July 6  2017,8.8,One of the person in charge of booking theaters and tours was absolutely useless. She told us that one of the show we wanted to see was fully booked and going to the theater's box office was going to be the same....  it was not .... I called and they still had tickets!,Pretty central close to the common gardens.
W Boston,Daniela,Canada,2 Reviews,June 19  2017,6.7,I stayed at the W for the weekend with a friend. We booked the hotel because the reviews were great and I've stayed at a W before and was very happy with the hotel and service. Our room was across from the gym and very noisy. On our last day there we were woken up at 6 am to someone working out at the gym. It sounded like they were in our room because it was so loud! We called the front desk to complain and they said that because we were leaving that day there wasn't really anything they could do about it. We took a video of the noise and went downstairs to talk to the manager. After we spoke with her and showed her the video she apologized and offered to take some money off one of the nights. About a week later the money still wasn't refunded on my credit card. I called the hotel a bunch of times and was assured the process took up to a week and I would be reimbursed. They said I should stop calling because they passed along the complaint to the accounting department so it was out of their hands and they couldn't help me. Three weeks later I still didn't have the refund so I called and asked to speak with the accounting department who had no idea about any of this. They said they didn't receive any information about issuing a refund. Once I spoke with them and explained what happened they processed the refund and I finally got my money back a month later. We were very disappointed with the customer service and how they handled the situation. I'm not usually one to complain but if I'm paying $400 a night I expect to have a good night sleep and exceptional customer service.,The hotel was in a good location and the rooms were clean.
W Boston,Maria,Abkhazia, â€‹ Georgia,1 review,June 19  2017,10,The only draw back is the noise at night from th people coming in and out of the lounge and adjacent nightclub.  Though it didn't bother us personally.,I loved how central the location was.  The hotel is in the theatre district. We walked to the harbour as well as Shopping and all the parks around us. After a long day of walking around we enjoyed  A massage at the Bliss spa. We also enjoyed having a drink at the lounge before going to bed. It was a great experience for us. It might be too  noisy for people who want peace and quite. I also had the best sleep in those beds.  I would recommend staying at the W Boston.
W Boston,Rutvij,Canada,1 review,June 19  2017,9.2,Noisy in the evening; due to club/bar in the Mezzanine! I was staying on the 7th Floor.,great breakfast; a bit pricy; but well made. I had an Egg White Omelette and kids ate Pancakes.
W Boston,Darleen,United States of America,1 review,June 12  2017,10,The prices at the restaurant were very high. but there were lots of restaurants in close proximity.,The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom/shower was very spacious!
W Boston,Richard,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,May 30  2017,5.4,Ridiculously noisy. external alarms. cars honking horns through the night and the thumping music till early hours made sleep tricky !  Not a hotel if you like a little peace in the evening.,The property location was perfect
W Boston,Anna,United States of America,1 review,May 20  2017,4.6,Service,Room wasn't ready at check-in and staff wasn't transparent about timeline for room to become avilable. They eventually had to put us in an uncomfortable handicap room.
W Boston,Dennis,United States of America,1 review,May 17  2017,10,Nothing,I was in the area because my wife was in the ER at Tufts.  I needed the hotel for the evening.  The hotel was awesome and affordable.  I cannot wait to go back and bring my wife and enjoy the experience together.
W Boston,Javier,United States of America,1 review,May 1  2017,10,cant really say anything negative. Great experience.,Very pleasantly surprised. Beautiful room and comfortable. Plus Dikembe Mutombo was staying there. What more could I ask for?
W Boston,Yvonne,United States of America,1 review,April 20  2017,10,The hotel cannot control the metal plate in the road that "bangs" when cars drive over it all night.,The bed was very comfortable and the berries and fresh fruit were awesome!  The staff was friendly and more than made up for a mishap with the room reservation.
W Boston,Ivan,United Kingdom,11 Reviews,April 16  2017,2.5,It was not up to usual W standard. it was noisy in the street. We came on Thursday night and apparently there was a DJ party (Thursday- Saturday) in the lounge 5 meters away from check in desk. The music was so loud that I could not hear the manager. We booked king size bed. but were given double bed instead. Apparently they didn't know that we are SPG gold and we instead of upgrade got downgrade...  manager told us that there are no available king bed rooms in any category. When we mentioned that we are gold - nothing changed - he decided to stick to the previous answer. although we could see rooms in other tiers available on booking.com.,N/A
W Boston,Robert,United States of America,1 review,April 12  2017,7.9,How crowded the lobby seemed. mostly with locals having a stance  putting out a "I'll kick your ass before I move" aura.,The overall atmosphere was clean and modern. easy to navigate to facilities I needed over stay.
W Boston,Rose,United States of America,1 review,April 11  2017,9.2,I didn't like that there weren't any toothbrush in the bathroom. It kind of bothered me that there was one robe in the room with a slight tear and the room was reserved for two guests.,I love the breakfast and the location very much. The establishment is very beautiful and convenient to get to downtown Boston. Everyone was very friendly and understanding. I would definitely go there again.
W Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,March 27  2017,5.4,We came in late on Friday night. as we drove up to the hotel and decided to unload our bags. we told the bellboy we will not be valet parking our car. As soon as the bell boy found this out. he walked away from our car and I had to unload the bags myself. During check-in. the staff were too preoccupied with the conversation they were having. waving us to wait while they finished talking. Once we did check-in and didnt actually have to deal with the staff. the hotel was just ok. The lobby area is very loud because it turnes into a lounge in the evening.,Proximity to center
W Boston,J,United States of America,23 Reviews,March 19  2017,7.9,Party Time on the weekend in the lobby; which is great but just be aware of it; as there is some noise until midnight.,Well located and very convenient staff
W Boston,Christopher,United States of America,1 review,March 14  2017,8.3,Had to wait 3 hours to get a room when we arrived even though we requested an early check in. The whole casting to TV thing they advertised did not work at all despite following the instructions.,The staff was very accommodating and hospitable. When we called down to request anything there was less than a 2-3 minute wait time to get what we ordered. The room was amazing and the lounge was very comfortable but still spacious.
W Boston,Mikki,United States of America,4 Reviews,March 6  2017,6.3,Caters to young glam party crowd. Not happy with layout. No kid friendly ammenities. No microwave. No useful fridge. it's crammed with things to buy. You pay for most things in the room so you're afraid to indulge. It was 12 degrees and extremely windy. took our breath away. so we stayed there solely because it was close to Blue Man group. just a block away and the only hotel close to it and available in the area. Since we had so much time in the room I was able to sketch the view. We left very early the next day to continue our mini-cation. Instagram- Malamik17,The room had an excellent view. but I did pay an extra $50 for it upon arrival. The hotel is beautiful. The sweet room cleaner was my favorite staff member. so kind. Other staff seemed embarrassed that we were there (single Mom and 11 yr old son). When we asked to explore the 'gallery' was full. I was hoping to see paintings. We were pointed to the business area up a flight of steps where zero people were and there are a few interesting things there. but we were afforded zero interaction from anyone. We were not able to go outside and explore the area because of the weather. We left once for food. the wind and cold took my son's breath away so he had a hard time facing forward. We made a game of him walking backwards when the wind picked up. This hotel isn't to blame for the weather. In hind sight I could have hired a driver to get us to some shopping areas.
W Boston,Julianna,United States of America,2 Reviews,March 5  2017,10,N/A,I loved all the technology that the room had offered and also I loved the look of the room it was awesome . this hotel is a great stay for anyone! Im definitely coming back soon !
W Boston,Ariel,Israel,2 Reviews,February 27  2017,9.6,the fact that it was just one night,Spent a night. an amazing hotel. The room is very big. comftrable. very clean. with many perks you dont find in other hotels. Quality is in the fine details.Got late check out at 15:00 without extra pay
W Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,February 27  2017,9.2,There needs to be prices listed for the refreshments. My bill was $100!! I wasn't crazy about all the organic snacks.,It was peaceful considering the hotel is in the city. Loved the Bliss products.
W Boston,Nova,United States of America,2 Reviews,February 22  2017,9.6,Can't think of anything - we had a great experience.,The food was actually amazing. Not just good - but fantastic. We grabbed lunch in the very cool but laid back bar area with our 10 and 13 year olds and had the best Lobster Bisque EVER. When we checked in. we were told that the bar area turns into a night club after a certain hour and that we would put on a high floor to make sure we weren't disturbed. We didn't hear a peep and had a cozy sleep in. We have stayed at a W Hotel in Sydney and were doubtful Boston could hold its own. but we were thoroughly impressed. Beautiful design. welcoming. and the location on the edge of Chinatown made it central to everything. including delicious restaurants. We will definitely return!
W Boston,Julia,United States of America,1 review,February 21  2017,10,Parking fee was really high! Valet was very nice but the $53 charge was ridiculous,Rooms were clean. large and staff was excellent! Very helpful with any questions.
W Boston,Jamie,United States of America,1 review,February 20  2017,9.6,Nothing that I can think of aside from not having microwaves in the room.,It was a great location. Two bars. such a fun place to stay and everything is around.
W Boston,Sarah,United States of America,1 review,February 14  2017,5.4,The accessible shower was broken (handheld). the room seemed "worn out"- chipped paint. etc. we couldn't access the free wifi either,Location was good
W Boston,Stephanie,United States of America,1 review,February 1  2017,10,N/A,The food is delicious. and the Bliss Spa was wonderful! I also enjoy hearing the music throughout the hotel in the elevators. outside. in the restaurant. hallways. and the lobby area.
W Boston,BRIDGIDT,United States of America,5 Reviews,January 29  2017,9.6,I didn't particularly care for the "shades" separating the bathroom from the bedroom. but that's just my preference.,Hotel was really fun to look at - great little details everywhere and unique artwork - I loved the inset candles in the rock walls.  The noise machine in the room along with the charging ports were great.  Room amenities overall were very nice and the beds were really the most comfortable hotel beds I have slept in in quite a while.  The staff were all very friendly.
W Boston,Stephanie,United States of America,2 Reviews,January 28  2017,7.1,The original room we were put in was not the room type we had booked or at least didn't look anything like what the fabulous room looks like online - it was a serious downgrade and the front desk person insisted it was a fabulous room until a pulled a picture up on my phone from their site and proved the room I was put in was not what I booked. I was offered another room that was what I had expected but did have a feeling that I had been taken advantage of the first time. The person who moved us was nice about the move though. Birthday Proseco was never sent to my room for my husband's birthday as was offered as I was being shown the new room. Why offer it at all if didn't have the ability to follow through? I would've rathered it not be mentioned at all. Also. the club crowd was a little rowdy. I understood  very quickly that it was a party hotel and respect that but not really my style; would've enjoyed it in my college days though.,The location was great.
W Boston,Suzanne,United States of America,1 review,January 23  2017,6.3,Was charged an extra $53 for parking still disputing . so the hotel charged me $106 for parking got in at 2:30pm left at 2:00pm the following day.... unbelievable for that alone it's not worth the money !!!!!,N/A
W Boston,Jeremy,United States of America,1 review,January 20  2017,10,There was only one night,I absolutely loved how Azra in the galley took the time give my wife and myself the extra attention that she did.  She recognized that we were unsure of what to do with our night away from our child and she made sure that we were well taken care of. The best part is we didn't ask her to do anything!  She completely took it upon herself to make sure we enjoyed our evening.  I hope that this somehow gets back to her because good employees need to know when they do an outstanding job!  Thank you!
W Boston,Kyle,United States of America,1 review,January 12  2017,9.6,Prices for everything we already pay enough for the room so their should be some free accommodations for guests who stay. for example free massages. free meal. drinks. anything to make the guest feel more at home and comfortable.,N/A
W Boston,Brandon,United States of America,1 review,January 8  2017,6.3,The room was that I received was not what the pictures showed and when I asked the lady at the front desk about the rooms she gave me attitude.,Nice modern feel and location is convenient.
W Boston,Jenny,Italy,4 Reviews,January 1  2017,10,We only had one robe in our room and no slippers. but we weren't bothered enough to ask for these from the front desk.,We loved our stay at the W Boston! The room was a great size and the bed huge and comfortable. The staff was so accommodating taking delivery of two packages for me and bringing them up to the room. I didn't use the Bliss spa on site. but it is an amazing spa so I will definitely visit next time!
W Boston,Bonnie,United States of America,1 review,December 28  2016,8.8,The location in the theater district was not my favorite of Boston locations I have stayed at with my family.The people in the area were not friendly at all.,The room was very comfortable and clean. The check in and out experience was so easy and enjoyable becauae of your employee Stephen cubbin.What an asset to your facility.
W Boston,Rhonda,United States of America,2 Reviews,December 21  2016,10,The outside noise was really bothersome to my Fiance.  He did not sleep at all because of it.,Stephen at the front desk was so friendly.  I told him we were there celebrating my fiance's 50th birthday and when we returned to our room for the evening. he had a cake and card waiting there for us.  The maid that cleaned our room was extremely friendly and personable
W Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,December 21  2016,5.4,I booked a king size bed and they ended up gave me a two beds room and saying they don't have any one bed room left. And it was the first day after I got married... hated it,N/A
W Boston,Elaine,United Kingdom,1 review,December 19  2016,9.2,no bath,The staff were all extremely helpful - every single person we encountered (front of house. concierge. room service. bell boys) and their service was very efficient - nothing was too much trouble for them.
W Boston,Carolynne,United States of America,1 review,December 12  2016,5.0,The extra charges. my friends being moved to a separate hotel. how long it took to get into our rooms. Lack of help when calling the desk for food. Attitude of employees telling us to be "quite" on my birthday.,It was pretty
W Boston,Charlrs,United States of America,5 Reviews,November 26  2016,9.2,For the price we paid. the towels should not be thread bare or have holes in them. big disappointment when I saw that.,Fantastic staff. greeted the moment we walked in the door.  Very quiet at night. love the windows that actually open.  Great shower with lots of hot water.  Great location. easy access to anyplace in the city.
W Boston,Maddy,United Kingdom,9 Reviews,November 20  2016,8.3,The rooms were extremely noisy. Not helped that there was construction in one of the next door rooms and a vile noisy partying guest in the other (at least one of which couldn't be helped by the hotel) but the rooms are just very noisy with thin walls. noisy plumbing etc. Also. when you check out. they just charge everything to your card and then email it to you and then any late charges are added on later so you don't have a chance to go through your bill at the time. which makes me very suspicious,Great location. great facilities.
W Boston,Adam,United States of America,4 Reviews,November 19  2016,8.8,I was asking for personal stuff but they kept giving me wrong amount ~,Location is good.friendly staff.room is comfy and clean!!doable but could be better~
W Boston,Brandon,United States of America,1 review,October 31  2016,9.6,I proposed to my fiancÃ© in the room but had to change rooms because the carpet was wet from a leaking pipe. They didn't upgrade me or give me any compensation.,I really enjoyed being in close proximity to a bunch of entertainment venues and great restaurants. The W has a fantastic Resturant In the lobby aswell. Also they had a huge Halloween party in the lobby. that was great!!
W Boston,Atoll,United Kingdom,17 Reviews,October 17  2016,7.1,Super noisy on Friday and Saturday night - because this is the centre of the clubbing district.  Bass beats and police sirens for a good chunk of the night.,Good food and decor and i was happy with the view from my room with windows along a 20 yard wall
W Boston,Michael,United States of America,1 review,October 11  2016,8.8,I didn't like that someone got stabbed in front of the W hotel on Saturday night. Made me feel really safe! Apparently that's happened before.,The atmosphere and cleanliness were great.
W Boston,Amber,United States of America,1 review,October 6  2016,6.3,Staff was slow and no where to be found most of the time. Very poor service from both Concierge and Valet. I was initially put into the wrong room. They told me to come down to the desk to retrieve a key to my new room. I waited over 10 minutes for Andrew to get to me. It was 2:30pm.,Boutique style. Comfortable bed. Friendly staff at lounge bar.
W Boston,Sean,United States of America,1 review,September 25  2016,5.8,Rooms felt old. We had a reservation for 4 but not the towels. cups etc for 4. Hair dryer was weak and insufficient. Bathroom counter were way too low and came to my lower thigh. Killed my back. Brushing teeth. shaving etc. Decor was showing its age.,Location near the commons was good. There's a small playground nearby which is good for those with youmg kids.
W Boston,Brian,United States of America,1 review,September 20  2016,10,when the City finishes the street construction it will be sweet(er),Location for an 'out of towner' is terrific. easy to get to all points of the City. Great walking town. Staff very helpful with everything from; directions/suggestions to delivery of room service.
W Boston,Josefina,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 19  2016,10,Restaurant is over priced.,The bed is super comfortable and so are the pillows. Their white noise machine made for a great night sleep since I always sleep with a fan on. Great location. was able to walk everywhere and close to the subway for fenway park.would greatly recommend.
W Boston,Kirk,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 8  2016,9.2,would have liked some milk in the fridge for coffee. AC was a bit drafty,upgrade. large TV. clever bathroom layout (with sliding door and screens to room). nice lobby
W Boston,Mr,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 6  2016,7.5,The breakfast area. the food over pricey. the check in desk is super cramp. Not even a single chair that we can find for my family member to rest while waiting for the staff to check us in. :(,The location and cleanliness of the room
W Boston,Jeff,United States of America,10 Reviews,September 2  2016,9.6,The only minor complaint is it would have been nice to have two caffeinated K-cups per person in the room rather than one.,We had a "cozy" corner room that was actually quite spacious. The bed was extremely comfortable. as were the pillows which we were tempted to try to smuggle out. Modern amenities. large glass shower. full length of the wall windows and the drapes blocked out the light very well. Very friendly front desk staff. We didn't get to the bar but it was extremely festive on weekend nights.
W Boston,Victoria,United States of America,1 review,August 30  2016,9.2,The bathroom in the lounge area was atrocious. Very dirty. paper towels littering the floor and counters.

W Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 17  2016,2.9,Staff focused on partygoers instead of guests; lobby loud with DJ at night. can't hear yourself talk to staff; very expensive for quality of location; staff unprofessional and appeared inexperienced; very dusty rooms,N/A
W Boston,Scott,United States of America,10 Reviews,August 14  2016,8.3,Construction at hotel. but obviously it has to be done at sometime or another.

W Boston,Becky,United States of America,1 review,August 8  2016,9.2,I was woken up earlier than I wanted on Friday and heard hours of someone working on a room. Lots of loud banging! ğŸ˜� I was disappointed that the latest checkout for me was 12. as a SPG member.,Great Location! Black light yoga was amazing. lobby was great to hangout in on Thursday night and Friday most the day before leaving gif my flight.
W Boston,Philip,United States of America,1 review,August 2  2016,7.5,Room was a little tired.  One of the reading lights was coming off the wall. the seat cushion on the desk chair was peeling. the electric outlet near the bed was a tangle of multi-prong extenders.,Great location. close to theater district and a short walk to Quincy Market. Aquarium. North End.
W Boston,Andrea,United States of America,1 review,August 1  2016,3.8,Very plain. dark rooms. I asked to move to a larger room (I booked the "spectacular" but it was like a dungeon so I asked to upgrade) at which time I was moved to a larger "mega" room for an additional charge. Which did have more windows. but was even smaller than my last. They removed the extra fee. But just overall the feeling of the hotel is very average. the neighborhood isn't great. and there are much better values for the money. (I paid $600/night with taxes etc),N/A
W Boston,Marina,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 20  2016,9.2,These are minor details in the grand scheme of things. but there were a couple things that could be better: 1) There were no easily accessible outlets on one side of the bed; 2) Shower door didn't close very well so lots of water escaped onto the floor. making it slipperly and somewhat dangerous if you weren't careful.,The staff were incredibly attentive and warm. My husband and I were there for a few days before our wedding and the staff had champagne waiting for us.
W Boston,Kate,United States of America,1 review,July 7  2016,10,Nothing :),The smell of the entire hotel and especially the rooms was just heavenly!!  The staff was always more than accommodating and the room service was always there in 30 minutes or less.  The location is fantastic for walking around Boston.  This is my second time staying at the W in Boston and I will definitely be back.
W Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 6  2016,8.8,The bedding could have been much cleaner.,The staff was beyond welcoming. Fabiola did a spectacular job getting us settled in and her customer service was out of this world!
Found Hotel Boston Common,Kathleen,United States of America,1 review,November 2  2017,5.0,For the money. I was disappointed in the whole presentation of the room.  The bathtub was old and made me cringe a bit.  I was overcharged for parking.  I brought it to the attention of the front desk afterwards and was told someone would call me....I never received the call.,The Location.  The continental breakfast.  One staff member was particularly helpful.  Allowed a later check out.

Found Hotel Boston Common,Vladimir,Czech Republic,5 Reviews,November 1  2017,3.8,Apparently $320 is cheap for Boston but still this was the worst hotel I was in (and I was in Eastern Europe..). There was even problems with the hot water. I had to switch rooms. "Breakfast" was just weird. No eggs. ham. sausage or whatsoever. Just a few fruits. muffins and make your own waffles. One of the staff was putting the bread with a fork to be more hygienic but then pushing the bread with bare hands!,The two things I liked was:1) Location2) The reception guy on check-out. he was friendly and kept my bags for the day.
Found Hotel Boston Common,Nathan,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 29  2017,5.4,I could not fully understand the lady at the front desk. She was not helpful at all and sort of rude. There was no place in the room to keep luggage unless you wanted to unpack. The hotel is old and could use some upgrading.,The location was good. We could walk to where we wanted to go.
Found Hotel Boston Common,Anonymous,Norway,45 Reviews,October 28  2017,4.6,At the time of check in. I could have booked a 5-star city centre hotel in Boston for what I paid at Found. Unfortunately my right to cancel expired two days prior to check in. Extremely small room. which is in desperate need of not just a makeover. but a complete renovation. Breakfast was complimentary. but just carbs. Fruit was over ripe. muffins were dry. juice and coffee very weak. I have stayed at worse hotels. but not at this price. This is comparable to a desert highway motel at 15 dollars a night.,Location was good. the staff members were friendly and helpful
Found Hotel Boston Common,T,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 20  2017,5.0,1. Felt like a ripoff. Paid more than $300 per night! It's worth $100 or less despite the convenient location.2. The room was a dungeon. Couldn't tell whether it was day or night.3. Bathroom was so small. I even couldn't turn.4. One front person was extremely rude and unpleasant. We were insulted.,The location was great.  Also "some" staff were friendly and kind.
Found Hotel Boston Common,Anonymous,United States of America,5 Reviews,October 20  2017,6.7,It is very expensive for what you are getting. The room was small which was fine. but also not very updated and only had a single pillow and a very noisy bed every time I shifted. It was serviceable but overpriced.,The staff were friendly and the breakfast had good variety. The location is great but you're really just paying for the location. On a weekend night when I was there it gets very busy and rowdy with college students and people coming out of shows and bars.

Found Hotel Boston Common,Caithriona,Ireland,17 Reviews,October 16  2017,7.9,Rooms are very small and bed is small.  You can hear people in other rooms if they are talking loudly.,Excellent location.  Very close to Boston Common.  Good breakfast available.  Room is clean.  Good water pressure in shower.  There is a computer in reception which guests can use.  Good value for money compared to many hotels in Boston and breakfast included.
Found Hotel Boston Common,Steven,United Kingdom,14 Reviews,October 16  2017,5.0,Pretty much everything. If you enjoy everything being disposable and zero service and small grubby rooms this is the place for you. It's apparent that the owners are relying on bookings because of the location. A bit of attention to detail would make this so much better. Plastic throwaway breakfast. I might have just cut out the middle man and thrown the breakfast away too. Bread for toast was mouldy. I just thought of a plus: the water was hot in the shower.,Location
Found Hotel Boston Common,Jill,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 13  2017,6.3,There was no housekeeping after hours. I became very ill and used up all linens and there were no more to be had. Also discovered ant nest in the bathroom.,The free breakfast was good.

Found Hotel Boston Common,Ida,Ireland,7 Reviews,October 12  2017,4.2,AT 239. this hotel was way over priced. It should be around the 80 mark. for something this poor quality in a fairly okay location.  Sheets were clean. but  breakfast very inadequate.,staff were nice.
Found Hotel Boston Common,Larm6,Costa Rica,11 Reviews,October 11  2017,5.0,I understand that this place is old. but elevator is crazy dangerous and super small. hallways also are very small so if you have two large bags (As I was carrying) then you will have trouble finding your room or moving across. If you plan to do some ironing. note that most of the irons are damage. which was a downside for me as I had several business meetings. There is a lot of noice entering into the room. do not expect anything fancy. this place is no fancy at all and they just give you shampoo.,the location. it is very close by to the center of Boston. If you walk around 15 minutes you will get to the aquarium and the duck boat tour. which is nice. On the way you have a lot of stores. restaurants and many options for you to do a walking tour by your own.
Found Hotel Boston Common,Mat,United Kingdom,10 Reviews,October 11  2017,6.7,So this place is a bit bizarre. What was good was also bad.Our room was OK for us but I have seen many reviews where people complained about them and understandably so.  The staff where friendly .. until the night we meet a very rude lady (who was lovely for the rest of the trip) and an even rider night receptionist.  If you meet these guys first I understand why the hotel gets a bad rep !!!The place is being refurbished. I sort of hoped to get a new room .. we got an old one which was tucked away and met our needs.  It was clean and dry ! The corridors and communal areas are in need of a lot of investment. The carpets looks awful. so does the reception and breakfast area.I would like to see what the place looks like once the work is done and whether they can make a nice hotel out of unfortunate surroundings. I can see the vision.I would say. Boston is expensive. and even though this place is cheap for Boston it is still over priced really (as are most of the Boston hotels we looked at).Btw  .. a taxi driver did ask if you can still book the hotel rooms by the hour. My guess is this place had a dodgy reputation in the past.So - positives - great staff are lovely .. some let them down by being unnecessarily  rude. Communal areas a bit rough and in need of work - which is being carried out. Area great during the day - quite a few dodgy characters at night (not that they caused us any grief). Location in terms of getting anywhere is superb.,So this hotel has awful reviews and I did not read them (stupidly) before I booked. I was then very worried !! The hotel is in an area which is very close to the common and easy walking distance of the key tourist attractions.  I must admit - we did not feel particularly safe walking around the area at night though.We arrived a little early to a hotel which looked like it had seen better days. However. an extremely friendly and helpful person checked us in.  Took us down a dingy corridor to a room which. to be fair. was perfectly clean and functional.The bed was a little cosy for 2 - but as we are recently married we still like each other and did not present a problem. Bathroom was functional and all worked fine. So location during the day - fab.  Room ok - a bit small and even though this hotel is at the cheaper end of the scale for Boston- it shows how over priced Boston hotels are. Breakfast - we decided on day 1 if it was bad - we would go out and eat. To be fair - it was good quality ingredients in a help your self setup (with a lady constantly replenishing and cleaning).Waffles. toast. coffe. juice. bagels. yogurts. fruit etc.  It did not have hot bacon or anything freshly cooked - but what was there was fine (apart from our last day when the juice machine broke).
Found Hotel Boston Common,Anonymous,Australia,7 Reviews,October 9  2017,4.2,Tiny. tiny room and even tinier bathroom. Not able to walk beside bed. Noisy area with hundreds of people leaving local bars at 2am and police moving them loudly. Breakfast on plastic plates. plastic utensils. poor selection of food. This hotel was the same price as my New York hotel and was inferior to NY.,Nice staff

Found Hotel Boston Common,Robert's,Canada,2 Reviews,October 2  2017,10,My bathroom floor was not level. cracked and you felt that you could fall through at any time.  Did not have the greatest feeling of safety.  But. everything was spotless.,I loved the location. the friendly staff and the great laundromat.  The biggest problem for the hotel is that very few cab drivers know who you are and where you are.  You need to invite all the cabbies to stop by and have a coffee and a muffin/donut. something.  Then they will know who you are and how to get to you.
Found Hotel Boston Common,Luciano,Italy,1 review,September 30  2017,4.6,Value for money: for what I paid. I expected much better. For a cheaper price. it is an OK accommodation,Position in city. wifi. breakfast OK. staff helpful
Found Hotel Boston Common,Marco,Colombia,15 Reviews,September 28  2017,4.6,Extremely overpriced for an old hotel with the sink next to the bed.

Found Hotel Boston Common,Margaret,Ireland,4 Reviews,September 27  2017,10,N/A,Came across an excellent staff member working at reception. On getting to the airport we distressingly found ourselves without passports. having left them in the room. He went above and beyond by taking it upon himself to drive to the airport to deliver them to us personally.
Found Hotel Boston Common,Carolyn,United States of America,1 review,September 27  2017,8.0,My son booked a room with a double bed. and had a decent room with a window.  I booked a room with a twin bed. and it was pretty darn small!! So small. in fact. that they removed the door into the bathroom because it would have intruded too much into the space.  The view out the "window" was into a shaft of four brick walls 3 stories high.  I understand this is a very old building. and the building that was erected later butted right up to the hotel. creating this enclosed space.  Really not the fault of the hotel owners. but it was kind of weird.,The front desk clerk. Edward. was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the area.  We had an overnight flight and arrived at the hotel at 6:30 a.m.  We were able to store our luggage. and although check-in is officially 3:00. he was able to get us in by 10:30 a.m.!  That was wonderful!!  We liked the breakfast room. which was clean and had just enough choices to make both my son and myself happy.  We thought the location was perfect -- right near the Public Gardens and Boston Common. near many restaurants. a short walk to the subway and to a pick-up spot for the trolley.  The beds were comfortable and clean.

Found Hotel Boston Common,Anonymous,United States of America,7 Reviews,September 20  2017,8.8,Fixtures (plumbing and lighting) are old-fashioned but the hotel is renovating and I'm sure they will change those.   Same with front steps into the hotel which are somewhat difficult to manage with heavy luggage.,Robbie at front desk is superb.  Knowledgeable. kind. so willing to help with everything.  All other staff I interacted with were very good too.  Room was quiet and extremely clean.   Location is excellent. I like the old building. and the price was good for the area.  Elevator was very fast. and I never had to wait for it.  There are lots of other hotels in the neighborhood but they are much more expensive.  I am glad I chose this hotel and would stay here again.
Found Hotel Boston Common,Anonymous,Jamaica,2 Reviews,September 19  2017,3.3,The lack of space in the room. misleading website photos. the dirty entrance steps. the noisy a/c which was immediately beside the head of the bed. less than empathetic staff. subpar cleaning of room.did I mention the super tiny room and even tinier bed that they CLAIM can hold a max of two persons?

Found Hotel Boston Common,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 8  2017,3.8,Hotel in general was very old and being a woman traveling alone I found it seedy.  The ice and vending machines were located in the basement.  No refrigerator in room.  When they cleaned the room they never replenished the coffee and things associated with it. no cups. no soap. never even cleaned the grinds out of the coffee pot or clean the pot itself.  The wifi was a hit or miss.  They were working in the hotel and you could hear them hammering early in the morning.,The day employee at the desk who checked me in was very nice and friendly.

Found Hotel Boston Common,Michael,United Kingdom,23 Reviews,August 28  2017,7.1,Notice in front lobby apologises for inconvenience during hotel's renovation.  We don't see any evidence of this work - but the hotel sure needs some love and attention.  Boston is clearly an expensive city - but we were surprised at the dilapidated feel of a hotel charging as much as The Found.,The location is this hotel's strong point - close to Boston Common. Theatres. Shops &amp; Public Transport.  It's front desk staff - we had a different member of the team every day - are extremely helpful.
Found Hotel Boston Common,Paul,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 27  2017,6.7,There was nothing special about the hotel given the cost.  However. this is the norm for Boston.  Comparatively. what you get for the value is actually good for Boston. which has very expensive hotels,This hotel had excellent proximity to the Boston Commons and the Orange and Green lines.  While the immediate neighborhood didn't offer any amenities. you could find nice coffee bars and restaurants near the Boston Commons.   The room and the lobby were clean.  The staff was very helpful. particularly giving advice about how to get to places in Boston.

Found Hotel Boston Common,Linda,Canada,1 review,August 23  2017,9.6,We could have used a small fridge in the room but we easily made do with an ice bucket.,Front desk staff were really friendly. well-informed. helpful and fun. The hotel is 140 years old and I love that they have kept many of the architectural details. The room was tiny but it was really everything that we needed. There was reliable wifi in the room. They were pretty relaxed about check-out time. and after we finally vacated the room they cheerfully stored our luggage so we could roam unfettered around Boston. and pick up our bags later en route to the airport.
Found Hotel Boston Common,Jane,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 23  2017,7.5,The parking in the garage across the street is rather inconvenient. The traffic was difficult to deal with. while bringing luggage across. Also the hotel only pays a portion of the parking charge and you will be responsible for the rest.,The staff were friendly and very helpful. The location is in the theater district and very close to many restaurants and Boston Commons. The continental breakfast had a nice selection and was always clean and well stocked.

We stayed only one night. not sure that I would have been comfortable for a week.,I liked the amiance of the property.  It seemed like a vintage boarding house might have felt.  I had a bit of trouble finding it but possibly my GPS was bouncing off of the buildings.  Breakfast was fine.
Found Hotel Boston Common,Axel,Colombia,10 Reviews,August 13  2017,2.9,Dirty and old carpets all around. Premises in bad condition. The room was very small. around 100 sqft. uncomfortable and very. very noisy. Its window so dirty that it was impossible to see through to the street. The night-shift clerk did NOT want to change us to a less noisy room using a less than polite language. almost shouting. Old and run down furniture. A very noisy air conditioning unit in the window (not a split unit) The filthy elevator had not seen a vacuum cleaner in months or years. This hotel should be closed because it does not offer the minimum standards. The relationship between services provided and cost is the worst we have experienced in our many years of international. worldwide traveling. Booking.com should have checked the ruinous state of this building. before allowing this business to offer misleading or frankly false information and photographs.,Location
Found Hotel Boston Common,A,United States of America,1 review,August 12  2017,4.6,Room was very small. window air conditioner was right over bed and blew in your face. very old stained carpet. bathroom was falling apart. walls looked dirty and stained. ants were crawling in tub. the pictures of the hotel didn't match the actual facility at all.,Good location on a side street.

Found Hotel Boston Common,Angiolo,Germany,8 Reviews,August 8  2017,3.3,The hotel was dirty and dusty: we found a rat in our room!We informed the hotel staff and they refused to change our room.

Found Hotel Boston Common,Anonymous,Greece,1 review,August 7  2017,4.6,The particular hotel is really bad.Starting from the beginning I arrived at the hotel after a 14 hour flight and the lady at the reception office was really rude. After that I discovered that the single room I had booked was nothing but a  custodian's closet that the hotel had turned into a room. The room was really small with the sink. shower and toilet being next to the bed. In a few words the room was nothing like the pictures presented on booking. Moving on. the breakfast was extremely poor. offering only cereal and waffles. The quality of coffee was also really bad. while in the dinning area the tables were so close to each other that allowed no privacy. The hotel itself is pretty old and in urgent need of a renovation. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. It's better to spend 30$ more and find a decent place to stay. Do not spent your energy and money on the particular hotel.,The only good thing about this hotel is the location. as it is easily accessible and located in the city centre.
Found Hotel Boston Common,Lisa,Colombia,13 Reviews,August 6  2017,8.8,The door to the bathroom opened into the toilet. and the shelf above the sink slanted downwards. so I could really put much on it.,The guys who checked me in and out were incredibly helpful and welcoming! And the air conditioning in the room was super cold! Great for these hot. humid days.
Found Hotel Boston Common,Eric,United Kingdom,15 Reviews,August 4  2017,9.2,The toilet was a little wobbly.,The location just a block and a half off the Common was perfect.

Found Hotel Boston Common,Anonymous,United Kingdom,20 Reviews,August 3  2017,2.9,Probably the worst hotel we have ever stayed at. Too expensive. Room very small. Air conditioning loud. Bed uncomfortable and creaky. Floor tiles in bathroom cracked and uneven- ideal for stubbing toes. Sink was in the bedroom. not bathroom. Breakfast. don't bother with it. Robbie was the only member who seemed interested in us otherwise staff unfriendly. Wallpaper peeling off. Polystyrene ceiling tiles didn't look safe. No shower gel provided. Felt vulnerable walking back at night. Carpets fraying at the edges. Windows filthy. Coffee in room disgusting. Empty bottle in corner of room when we arrived.  Need I say  any more...,NOTHING!

Found Hotel Boston Common,William,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 31  2017,10,The only thing that bothered us. The waffle iron was cleaned with lots of Windex 10 minutes before the schedule closing time. I was really looking forward to a waffle for breakfast but glad I was not able to have some because of Windex.,The front desk check in clerk was excellent wealth of sightseeing information. Very helpful. informative and very pleasant. The Found was a fantastic place to spend the night on the 4th of July. Just a few blocks from the river front park concerts and front row view of the fireworks. Everything was a short walk. Most enjoyable stay in Boston.

Found Hotel Boston Common,Stacey,Israel,1 review,July 22  2017,8.3,I was traveling with a good friend  and I had booked the last room available-one double bed. I thought not a big deal worse case I'd sleep on the couch. (We're both female). The room however was very small meaning only a small night stand on either side of the bed and a small dresser to the side of the bed fit in the room. The bathroom was also on the small side. We managed but the room would have been better suited to either a couple or a single traveler. I didn't see the other rooms so I don't know how they would have been.,Location is everything and this had that.....walking distance to everything. metro station right around the corner. Boston is very expensive and this hotel was reasonably priced with a nice breakfast. Parking was across the street at an indoor garage with a half price discount. I also liked it because it was an old brownstone building which I love.

Found Hotel Boston Common,Eric,United States of America,1 review,July 21  2017,3.8,N/A,This hotel was once called the Milner Hotel.  Now Called Found Hotel.  It is very old.very small rooms.  about 10 x 15. no lounge. no bar. a drawer was missing from the chest of drawers. the tv was on the opposite wall from normal position of the bed.The charge including taxes was $ 300.00 plus parking.   And the hallways whereabouts 3 feet wide.It should revert to being a flop house for the homeless though they might find it a bit confining.Eric L.
Found Hotel Boston Common,Lauren,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 20  2017,10,There was nothing I didn't like about this hotel.,Would definitely return! Front the minute we got there we experience great customer service.  Received great directions on getting to where we needed to go. Very friendly staff and quaint hotel.  For being an older hotel. it was the wonderful and pleasant stay.  Felt right at home. Perfect for being a tourist. near everything. and in walking distance to downtown.  Great selection for a continental breakfast.  Very quiet and most importantly loved our room and bed.  Our room was clean and I loved the shower head so much. I wanted to take it with me.  When I plan a trip to come back to Boston. I will definitely consider coming back.  Worth the money and at a very decent rate.

Found Hotel Boston Common,Anonymous,Canada,7 Reviews,July 17  2017,4.6,AC always blowing air (even when not cooling) so noisy and cannot sleep with AC on. Toilet not secure and wiggling (not the seat mind you. the whole thing). Window facing a dark brick wall = no light whatsoever. Hot water takes long time to come when showering. Breakfast is disappointing. watery juice and not much choice. Very expensive for what it is but that's Boston for you: accommodation is crazy expensive. prices literally make no sense.,Location is great.

Found Hotel Boston Common,Paula,United States of America,4 Reviews,July 12  2017,8.8,The public areas (halls. elevator. lobby) are rather tired and dingy. But the hotel is undergoing renovation and will surely be improved.,This hotel was clean and comfortable in a great location. The staff was helpful and friendly. Nothing fancy. but a fine place to sleep. A basic breakfast--bagels. waffles. fruit and yogurt etc was included in the price. Theatre's and many restaurants nearby. Area is walkable and close to many public transportation options. We were able to walk from the South Station. A good base for exploring Boston.
Found Hotel Boston Common,Zoe,Australia,4 Reviews,July 12  2017,4.2,We are not opposed to staying in basic accommodations when the budget calls for it. especially in Boston. when we didn't anticipate spending much time in the room anyway.  But we paid much more than we felt this room was worth. The first room we were given was a bit scary - a tiny little box with no windows and what seened like neon lighting. We asked to move to a room with a window and had to pay extra for the privilege. on top of the already inflated price.,Location.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Ivan,Ireland,1 review,November 1  2017,10,Socket for the hairdryer in the bathroom did not work.Was not sure if the bottled water in the room was complimentary or if we had to pay for it.Hard really to find fault!!,Beds were very comfy. room was a really good size and very clean also the decor was very pleasant. the location is excellent with lots of shops restaurants and places to visit nearby.

Hyatt Regency Boston,Gulscia,Turkey,26 Reviews,October 17  2017,8.8,Parking is expensive. but usual problem of boston. We got cold around pool area.

Hyatt Regency Boston,David,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,October 10  2017,5.8,Used Decaf pod. but was replaced with original coffee pod. Man brought up more pods but NOT decaf! Sent away to get some - didn't return. so rang yet again. Same man then appeared with decaf pods. He didn't seem to understand English just looking at us blankly. Housekeeping took away our dirty towels but left no clean ones in return. Complained to services manager about both issues. who said he'd sort out service for next day but didn't offer any refund for poor service. Not impressed!,N/A
Hyatt Regency Boston,Michael,Switzerland,19 Reviews,October 3  2017,6.7,No films channels on TV. as Hyatt sell films. 2 elevators needed to access street fro  rooms. Gym if a lomg walk and many stairs from all rooms,good location
Hyatt Regency Boston,Tomer,United States of America,17 Reviews,October 2  2017,9.6,- You need to take two different elevators to go from the building entrance to the rooms.- Water bottles are available in the room with a label attached that starts with the word "complimentary". but only if you read the entire thing (in a tiny font) you realize that they in fact cost $3.50. That's kind of deceptive...,Nice views and a sense that everything is new. Very good location.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,October 2  2017,7.9,We arrived to be told the hotel had overbooked our room.  We were downgraded for the night and then had to switch rooms the next day.  The daybed in the lounge was not made. there was no bed linen or towels (for both the downgraded room and the Suite we had originally booked) and we had to chase the hotel to get that organized.  The reception staff didnâ€™t appear to be too sympathetic and offered a free breakfast (when we already had a breakfast-inclusive rate). then offered a late checkout and we had already arranged that.,The view from the room was superb and the breakfast /restaurant staff were very polite and efficient.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Maureen,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 30  2017,4.6,The room was dirty!!! There was mold in the shower! Dust build up on the exhaust fan in the bathroom. Dust build up on the carpet around the beds and walls. We called each day for extra towels and a pillow that we never received! Our last day we waited until 6pm and no one came to clean our room or refresh our towels! At that point we had a Manager come up to the room. After showing him the filth he did apologize and had 1 night deducted from the bill. I would never stay there again!!!,The location was great and the parking attendants were excellent

Hyatt Regency Boston,Ana,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 26  2017,5.8,Note. you have to take 2 sets of elevators getting to and from your hotel room.

Hyatt Regency Boston,Anonymous,Israel,8 Reviews,September 22  2017,10,We were surprised to be charged for the 3rd person's breakfast.This was inspite of the fact that breskfast was included in the reservation. And this is also what we were told at the front desk when we arrived. By the way we were also charged for a bottle of water alghough it had a sign saying complimentary.,Centrally located.very convenient and nice hotel. The room was very wide and the beds comfortable.

Hyatt Regency Boston,Kristin,United States of America,1 review,September 19  2017,6.3,We were out of our room all day on day 2 and when we returned at 5:30pmour room still had not been cleaned. Someone finally came by around 6pmand asked if we wanted our room cleaned. we said yes but to please comeback on 15 minutes while we were at dinner. When we came back at 9:30pmour room still had not been cleaned. We called the front desk and theysaid they "would make a note" Half an hour later at 10pm wegot a call asking if we wanted someone to clean our room. Seriously at10pmat night when our kids were getting ready for bed?! They had allday! We declined and asked that they at least bring fresh towels. Hotelsin Boston are pricey so it was a lot to pay for a room with no cleaningservice for our 2 night. 3 day stay.,Location was great. within walking distance or quick Uber ride toeverywhere we wanted to go.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Peter,Germany,30 Reviews,September 15  2017,9.6,Parking lots have to be paid and they are very expensive (40 dollar/ night),Very clean and quiet hotel right in the middle of Boston. Had an amazing view from 14th floor over Boston
Hyatt Regency Boston,Bee,United States of America,1 review,September 14  2017,9.6,Kinda wished someone helped me with my bags (I had 2 suitcases and a backpack on top of handbag) but it wasn't a biggie. I couldn't log into the WiFi but I only stayed a night so it wasn't a big deal either. Also kinda wished that they could give complimentary breakfast for solo travelers but it wasn't a pain. I also wish that they would be more helpful about providing information on getting to the hotel from the airport or bus station.,I arrived at close to 12am and the receptionist was super friendly and patient. The bed was super comfy and the bathroom was great. The room was pretty spacious as well.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Phuong,United States of America,1 review,September 13  2017,7.5,Lacking of shuttle. But it didn't take long for us to figure out how to get to the hotel via public transportation.,Staff was helpful. courteous. friendly. We were greeted with smiles and that goes a long way.

Hyatt Regency Boston,Stephanie,United States of America,1 review,August 23  2017,7.5,I couldn't find a pamphlet or booklet on the hotel so really didn't know about most of the amenities available to guests.  The Keurig was tucked away in a drawer that I discovered 20 minutes before checking out.,The room seemed recently updated and we had a room on a floor high enough (17th) to see some of the Boston area.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Karen,United States of America,1 review,August 22  2017,7.9,Roll away bad was horrible. Could feel the springs. Took turns using it because did not provide for good nights sleep. Don't use it again with another family.,Brunch very good
Hyatt Regency Boston,Shashank,United States of America,7 Reviews,August 21  2017,7.9,The refrigerator. microwave. and a lamp were broken.

However. the asst. manager (Riquel) perfonally emailed me to apologize for the matter. Appreciate the personal touch.,Great location. just minutes walk from Boston South Station. Also adjacent are some really tasty eats (Boston Chinatown) and nice Irish bars (Black Rose). Very convenient to reach the Boston Harbor as well (by walk). There are a few shops nearby as well.

Hyatt Regency Boston,Michelle,United States of America,1 review,July 20  2017,5.4,No shuttle to/from airport or bus terminal.  For price of nights stay one would expect this - as all other hotels offer this.  Coffee in room was horrible.  Staff wasn't very helpful when asking locations of various places - seemed no one knew the area.  Bedding/towels/etc weren't refreshed everyday. we had to ask for everything - even toilet paper.  A hot tub would have been nice in pool area.,The doorman was very friendly/helpful.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Jean,Singapore,2 Reviews,July 20  2017,7.1,The staff forgot to clean the room one day and the food and hot chocolate from our dinner the night before turned rancid and the whole room smelt awful when we returned that evening.The fire alarm rang late one evening and we all had to go down to the street for half an hour.,N/A
Hyatt Regency Boston,jengustin,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 19  2017,9.6,At one point. we couldn't get into our room and it was after a long day......reason being the battery on the door that scans the key card died and we had to wait about 1/2 hour to get it fixed.

Hyatt Regency Boston,Shabriel,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 12  2017,8.8,I've stayed at this location before and I like it. This recent time I had a minor incident. I booked my room through booking and I requested a king size room. When I got the checked in and went to my room I was placed in a room with two queen sized beds without my knowledge. I than go downstairs to the front desk and tell them that I booked a king size room and showed him my reservation. He said to me you booked through booking right. I said yes he said well than it's not guarantee which room you get. I never heard that before. I felt I wasn't getting treated fairly since I booked through booking.com,N/A
Hyatt Regency Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 10  2017,8.3,The AC was too high... The gym was so cold it made working out difficult. The room was nice. the bed was great BUT. there were no drawers to put our clothes in only a small poorly designed closet unit.  The housekeeping staff was truly strange... They kept taking our towels etc. but did not replace them. It was a battle to keep towels in the bathroom.  The rest of the staff was very nice. especially Faoud. he was great. The concierge was excellent... Very helpful.,The location and view
Hyatt Regency Boston,Tyra,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 8  2017,8.3,Maid service was not completed before we returned home from a day of adventure. It's not acceptable to be cleaning rooms after 5 pm when we leave before 7 am and are gone for 10 hours. Our maid did an excellent job other than that. Awkward pool arrangement. enter on sixth floor and walk down stairs to access pool through gym area.,Bed was comfortable. Hotel is steps from the opera and we walked to see Wicked. Hotel is connected to Macy's via an elevator and short hallway. Concierge was friendly. Boston Club sandwich was delicious. had it twice!
Hyatt Regency Boston,Steve,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 5  2017,7.5,Site states check-in at 4pm. We got there at 1230. Spoke with rep and was told we would have room on 17th floor with good view of Boston and bags will be delivered.  You'll get a text when your room is ready. Went out to do some shopping. got text at 430. Went back to settle in. Spoke with a different rep. Put us in room 928 stating no rooms available above 9th floor. Checked on room lovely view of old industrial bldg. Not. Took 30 minutes before finally finding the room on floor 17. Had to wait an additional 15 minutes for a cleaning manager to inspect it and give us the ok to go up. Got the go ahead only to find the cleaning lady STILL vacuuming the room. Had to wait a few more minutes in the hallway for her to clear out. Next morning wife &amp; I went to breakfast let 16 year old daughter sleep in. Put do not disturb sign out. Got back and daughter told us cleaning lady came in &amp; asked if we were leaving today. Glad they supply that sign for no reason. Will not be going back to that location. Even thought was quite convenient.,Breakfast was delicious. A bit pricey. Buffet is overpriced.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Andrea,United States of America,4 Reviews,July 5  2017,8.3,Bathroom well-appointed (good hair dryer) but water pressure was just average. We were given a larger than normal corner room to allow for rollaway beds for our two teenage boys. We were on the top floor which we appreciated for the view. unfortunately. the room was quite warm. The AC did not cool the room more than 72 degrees; the engineers said there was nothing more they could do. Our refrigerator worked very poorly and we lost all our breakfast foods. Breakfast was comped one morning but what we really wanted was a replacement refrigerator.,Very well-equipped workout room. Great location.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Win,United States of America,1 review,July 5  2017,3.3,The price was 30% higher when I booked one day ahead. They only took the higher price booking price. Not feeling well at all.,There are so many better choices out there.

Hyatt Regency Boston,Julie,United States of America,1 review,June 25  2017,9.6,The business center wasn't working properly and i wasn't able to print my boarding pass for free.  I had to pay to use the internet to access my my boarding pass as well as pay to print them out.,The room was great - very clean and roomy. The bed was comfortable and the temperature of the room was perfect for us.  The staff was amazing. They were helpful and answered all of our questions and gave great recommendations. The hotel is perfectly located in the theater district and it's just a short walk to anywhere you might want to go.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Voula,Australia,3 Reviews,June 18  2017,10,Not a lot to fault. but if I have to find something it's the curtains. they didn't close properly. so light emitted through. Also cleaners didn't always top up items like cotton buds and shower cap.,Loved the room and the location. Close to cafes. restaurants and shops. Easy walking distance to most places of interest. Lots of clothes hangers and hooks.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Anonymous,Thailand,3 Reviews,June 15  2017,5.4,Staff who checked us in/out wasn't so welcoming. I don't know if it was the reason that we have different skin color or he wasn't just motivated to work. We also had a problem with credit card that it can be used worldwide and there was no balance on it. The staff informed us that the card we used for payment didnt work so we used another one. As soon as we flew back to home country. there was a small charge on the credit card that didn't work.Surprise surprise surpise.,We got dirty towels that there were reddish yellowish stains on. Contacted Front Office about it. A staff said he would send new towels up. Hours later. nobody came up. I got tired. Went straight to bed. Called Front Office again in the morning. finally somebody brought up new fresh towels. Also. in the bathroom. the finishes weren't finished. The plug socket was about to come off. there were dirty spots on the wall...This hotel deserves to be just a 4 star not 5.

Hyatt Regency Boston,Ashley,United States of America,1 review,June 12  2017,9.6,N/A,We left a bag in a taxi. and the Hyatt Security team worked with us to try and track it down. We were unable to locate it. but not for lack of assistance. The room was immaculate. every member of the team was helpful. friendly. and polite. and the room service that we ordered when we got in late was amazing after a day of stress and travel. I look forward to staying there again the next time I have the opportunity to visit Boston.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Laurie,United States of America,1 review,June 7  2017,10,We were woken up at 5:45AM by bass and thumping techno music. courtesy of one of our next door neighbors. Not the hotel's fault. just a marr on an otherwise excellent stay.We also decided to spring for pricey. but convenient breakfast room service and were a little disappointed to have barely warm food and a soggy waffle. It arrived promptly at the time we ordered it for and was delivered to our room by a very nice guest services staff member. but for the price was far from worth it.,The man that checked us in was great and the bartender was super friendly and helpful.The view on the 17th floor was incredible and the room was a great size for being a hotel downtown!
Hyatt Regency Boston,Renata,Brazil,2 Reviews,June 5  2017,9.2,The breakfast is very expensive,I really like the localization that is in downtown and easy for walk in the city. Boston is an amazing city and very green. The hotel is very good and good accommodations.

Hyatt Regency Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,7 Reviews,May 23  2017,6.3,There are a couple of small things that disappointed me. First I really don't understand why the housekeeper had to knock our door around 10am on a Saturday morning. We did not hear her knocking. so she got someone to pick the lock. This just sounds ridiculous to me. Second. the makeup mirror in the bathroom was not clean. I don't really want to describe how it looked. Third. the gym has only one shower in the female changing room. And the last thing is that the water pressure of the shower in the room was poor.,Great location. It has a walking distance to the train station. China town. and Newbury street; basically everywhere that we planned to visit.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Tom,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,May 21  2017,10,N/A,Staff were brilliant. in particular the guys at the entrance helping with travel and greeting you . Pool is great and was nice a quiet . open until 11pm which was good . Amazing view from our room at the top floor and comfy bed.

Hyatt Regency Boston,Anonymous,Canada,1 review,May 10  2017,9.6,If you are walking. the entrance seems out of the way unless you walk through Macy's store. There are numerous homeless people. especially after 6pm. in the downtown area and in Boston Common park.,Location is perfect for access to public transport. easy commute from airport.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Fadwa,United States of America,4 Reviews,May 5  2017,9.6,None.,Excellent location for any type of traveller. Easy access to the subway (T) and most attractions. Very clean facility! No matter what we needed or inquired about. staff were phenomenal!

Hyatt Regency Boston,Zikar,United States of America,4 Reviews,May 3  2017,7.9,I had only one incident with a coffee machine that wasn't working.. and I called 3 times to be replaced with a working one. The first time replaced came with no filter and thus was leaking and brewing properly. and it took more than 15 minutes to be delivered.  Then I called again and asked for replacement and left the room. and came back after 5 hours and still the same machine. so I asked to talk to a manager who sent Housekeeping manager (I guess) to replace it.I actually work in 5 stars hotel. and I know exactly how the quality and speed of service are. which made it surprising to me for this small/possible change to be made.,I did like the cleanliness of the hotel and nice view of the room.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Plus the location is very suitable and close to downtown.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Mirna,United States of America,1 review,May 2  2017,9.2,Breakfast was a bad experience. waited over 30 minutes for an omelette that arrived cold. One evening at the bar the two bartenders were having an argument in front of every guest seated there.,Kevin at check in was fabulous! The beds were comfy. hotel was really in the middle of all the action.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Satya,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,April 25  2017,10,N/A,This a high quality. spacious hotel with modern fittings. It is brilliantly located in the theatre district with excellent restaurants in walking distance and a shopping area. There is good access to public transport across the city. The big appeal is the excellent attitude and responsiveness of the Manager and staff. They were helpful in dealing with requests and minor issues. Our queen-queen room was spacious and incredibly comfortable. We were 2 adults and 2 children. staying for a week. and there was plenty of space to not feel as though we were on top of each other. I highly recommend this hotel.
Hyatt Regency Boston,Sheila,United States of America,1 review,April 20  2017,6.3,Although the rooms were kept clean we had to either call the desk or go find a housekeeper to get more towels. washcloths and toiletries 3 of the 4 days we were there.  One day we were given smeary looking drinking glasses in our room.  We didn't like that we had to pay for a couple of copies that we needed and were charged by the 10 min. to use the computer/printer. Printing boarding passes were free. but when we got to the airport they wouldn't scan (ink too light) so we had to print new ones at the airport.  When we checked out of the hotel the man at the desk told us that our bill was $750. more than what my paperwork showed. When I showed him my bill through Booking.com he gave it to us for that amount. but he rolled his eyes and had an attitude!,It was a very attractive hotel with comfortable beds and a nice restaurant. The concierge was great with restaurant recommendations and always helpful.  The bartender was also kind to give me a can of ginger beer w/o charging when I asked if they had some. They also had great support for the Boston Marathon runners like water. protein bars and bananas the morning of the race plus people there to cheer the runners when they returned to the hotel.  It was near enough to the Boston commons and gardens that we could walk. It also backs up to a large shopping mall w/ access to Macy's through their parking garage...nice surprise!
Hyatt Regency Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,April 14  2017,8.3,The selection of free weights in the gym was pretty limited - no olympic bar or decent barbell set up. Also no squat rack/cage.,Buffet breakfast was good. especially as it was included in our room rate
Charlesmark Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 25  2017,8.8,Continental breakfast was underwhelming,Loved the personal stereo system in room &amp; classical music playing when first entered the room. Very comfortable bed. Helpful staff. Jefferson in the cocktail lounge was very personable. informative. &amp; made a great cocktail! Great location.
Charlesmark Hotel,Joyce,Canada,2 Reviews,October 17  2017,4.6,Pictures show it has an outdoor patio.  False.  The outdoor patio is completely independent.  The only food they served was flatbread.  Free breakfast consisted of bagels. small amount of fruit and oatmeal.  Our room smelled bad.  To top it all off. we were charged more than we were quoted.,I chose the hotel because of its location and wasn't disappointed there but the hotel left much to be desired.
Charlesmark Hotel,Barbara,United States of America,6 Reviews,October 16  2017,7.5,No parking. lobby is awful. hotel is dark. room dingy. rooms are very noisy. You can hear your neighbors quiet conversations through the walls.. and street noise. No place to pull up to hotel and load or unload luggage. No staff at door to assist.,Location. staff
Charlesmark Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 11  2017,5.4,Room and bed were tiny - not even a queen bed.  Bed took up most of the room.  Breakfast was coffee and a bunch of cold bagels.  Bathroom was also tiny.  Not worth the exhorbitant price at all.,Location was good.
Charlesmark Hotel,Harold,Canada,4 Reviews,October 7  2017,7.1,May be considered a "standard room". if so. should come with a shoe horn. Had to walk sideways to get to my side of the bed.Light breakfast included. no kidding. If it was any lighter it would disappear.,The location is great. Across the street from the library and the Hancock Building. surrounded by beautiful churches. and very close to a subway station. and an Irish pub. plus other more healthful and affordable restaurants.
Charlesmark Hotel,David,United States of America,7 Reviews,September 30  2017,8.5,My room faced Boylston (most don't). It was a little noisy. but it turned out of my two (very large) windows was cracked open about ½ inch. Quieter when I shut it fully. It's thus unclear if the noise would have been fine if I had noticed this earlier. All that said. I slept very well.WiFi is very slow. Not useless. but close to it. Needs a fix. or serious upgrade.Breakfast was good. but pretty minimal—some donuts. bagels. creme cheese (spread. not the real thing. which would be better). Higher quality in these. and espresso. would be a nice addition.,Location is superb. Three blocks from the Back Bay Amtrak station. Right on Boylston St. in the middle of Back Bay. Rooms are small. but very comfortable.
Charlesmark Hotel,Anonymous,Israel,1 review,September 28  2017,8.3,Lack of a desk or a table in the room,Excellent location. good WiFi connection. clean. breakfast was OK . My room was rather small and therefore didn't have a desk (or a table). which - being on a business trip - was quite a shortcoming.  Other than that - this is a very nice hotel.  Good value for money.
Charlesmark Hotel,J,Brazil,39 Reviews,September 27  2017,7.9,Room is on the small side. I was on one of the back rooms. There are no views and other buildings can see inside your room since windows are high. Breakfast is not attended and no hot option. Very narrow corridors.,The decor of the room is very modern and pleasing with sound equipment for those that want to listen to music with speakers on the wall. Floor of shower is non-slippery. Decor of the bathroom is also very nice. Location is outstanding with Copley subway station accross the street as well as bus stop. Restuarants and shops in Newbury Street one block away. Bagels and donuts in breakfast were fresh.
Charlesmark Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 25  2017,10,It was pretty noisy from my room. which overlooked Boylston. but I had asked for a view.  Plus it was Saturday night.  Also blackout curtains would be nice for those rooms. because the blinds didn't block the very bright early morning sun. so I couldn't sleep in.,Location. room was nice. bar was cool.  Great matinis and atmosphere.
Charlesmark Hotel,Lynne,United Kingdom,23 Reviews,September 20  2017,6.7,The room we had was very small but OK for 2 nights.  Breakfast was disappointing - only oatmeal and bagels.  Would have preferred cereals.  Expensive for what you get even by Boston standards.,The hotel is in a good location for most major attractions. 10 mins to Boston Common and about 30 mins to Quincy Market and Faneuil Hall.  It is very clean and staff were friendly and helpful.
Charlesmark Hotel,Thomas,United States of America,18 Reviews,September 20  2017,8.3,One drawback was a couple of wall pegs instead of a clothing closet with clothes hangars. I asked for the hangars. and got them from a very nice staffer. Breakfast is spartan. but appreciated.,Superb location next to the Copley T stop and across from the Boston Public Library. Marathon finish and all the shopping/restaurants in the heart of the city.  While the room was on the small side. it was thoughtfully designed. Good staff. Good value.
Charlesmark Hotel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,September 18  2017,6.7,Very expensive hotel relative to services eg Breakfast is repetitive and very weighted to carbohydrates. No skimmed milk. only half and half. Lounge area a little jaded. perhapsRemember to add in the tax etc as this significantly adds to the cost of the hotel.,The location is central to a range of must-see sights
Charlesmark Hotel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,September 16  2017,6.3,Very  small rooms and small bed not particularly comfortable for 2 people. Insufficient space to store clothes. had to actually live out of a suitcase.  Ideal for a 1 night stay but could be stressful for longer stays.,Positives were the room was very clean. good aircon. room serviced every day and the position excellent with quick access to T  line into downtown Boston. only 10-15 mins away.
Charlesmark Hotel,Carol,United States of America,5 Reviews,September 14  2017,9.6,Not the fault of the hotel. but the street in front was being dug up snd it was very noisy.,Small boutique hotel. Nicely appointed. Sophisticated. Excellent customer service. Perfect location in my favorite area of Boston-Copley Square. You can park your car in a nearby garage and forget about it. You can walk almost everywhere or take convenient public transportation. Breakfast included.
Charlesmark Hotel,Gerald,United States of America,1 review,September 14  2017,6.3,My biggest gripe was that the room was weird... a whole wall of shelves?! The bed was positioned on the wrong wall - it was like the room was designed to be laid out differently. but then the management wanted to throw a couch in and the only way it worked was to reverse the room layout... which meant the AC blew on my head all night. and made me ill.,Great location. Nice to have a bar. Weird to have a whole sidewalk cafe but no food... having so many empty tables actually makes it look like "not a good place"... As a hotel. it was so-so. clean enough. but dated.
Charlesmark Hotel,Michael,United States of America,1 review,September 12  2017,10,small room. but very nice and clean,The place and value were great considering the location and the rates of surrounding hotels.  Overall the place was great; an excellent value and great location. We would recommend.
Charlesmark Hotel,CAS129,Colombia,26 Reviews,September 9  2017,8.3,Breakfast can be better. Its very simple. I had to go out and seek for a real breakfast because the hotel option was not attractive at all.,Very good location. Our room was good. you get what you pay. anything more.
Charlesmark Hotel,James,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 5  2017,8.3,View from window had a very good view of the air condition unit on top of the building.  if you never seen a air condition unit very interesting.,things were good. bed was very good
Charlesmark Hotel,Kim,United States of America,1 review,August 28  2017,8.3,It can be noisy because it's a small boutique hotel. You can hear people in the hallway and noise from the lounge. Extra couch/bed is like sleeping on a slab of concrete.,Absolutely perfect location for Back Bay!  Great bar/lounge downstairs. Cool vibe.
Charlesmark Hotel,Stuart,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,August 13  2017,9.6,More comfortable seating in the breakfast area.,Excellent location. really convenient for exploring Boston and close to the underground for travelling to the airport. Comfortable room and convenient breakfast facilities.
Charlesmark Hotel,Laetitia,France,10 Reviews,August 2  2017,7.9,The breakfast is free but it can hardly be considered breakfast. A little bit of cereals. coffee. tea. a few fruits and no milk. only half and half (or maybe they did not have any when I stayed there. even if I did ask about it).,Great location. right in Copley Square where you can find the express bus to the airport and the Green Line for the T. The hotel itself is comfortable with great amenities in the room : many TV channels. a safe. hair dryer. and a guide of Boston !
Charlesmark Hotel,Julie,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 1  2017,10,More breakfast options. Would have liked to have had milk.,Great location. Loved the rooms very nice &amp; clean. Staff was very helpful. Close to so many places in Boston.
Charlesmark Hotel,Michael,United States of America,1 review,July 31  2017,8.3,Closest parking was a 4-5 minute walk away for $28 overnight.  Closer parking is available for $48 overnight.,Great neighborhood on Boylston and a block from Newbury St. Plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance to choose from. It is one of the better values compared to other hotels in Boston.  Half a block from the Copley T station if you want to get to another part of the city. 15- 20 minute walk to Fenway Park for the Sox game.
Charlesmark Hotel,Paul,United Kingdom,18 Reviews,July 31  2017,10,N/A,Great location. Super nice and friendly staff. Good Bar. Great price. Room was very comftable. Hot shower with great water pressure. Breakfast was OK.
Charlesmark Hotel,Francis,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 27  2017,9.6,My room was downstairs. It was a. It like staying in a cave...but one you want to be in! Breakfast was very basic but free! And in the middle of Boston!,This hotel is literally in the middle of everything you want to do (or should want to do!)
Charlesmark Hotel,Christina,Turkey,2 Reviews,July 26  2017,9.2,Why not offer cake parking for an extra $10-15? Would be great.,Breakfast is nice. but not like those in Europe! The Turkish breakfast puts this shame.
Charlesmark Hotel,Barbara,Bermuda,1 review,July 23  2017,9.6,N/A,Great location! Well configured room for size. Room &amp; bathroom were spotless. Lovely thick. fluffy towels. Didn't find a closet for hanging clothes but plenty of open shelf space if you want to unpack. We didn't need to for 2 nights. Huge wall mirror which gave a feel a spaciousness.Very pleasant Front Desk Staff.
Charlesmark Hotel,Rawa,United States of America,1 review,July 13  2017,9.2,When they say breakfast. they mean a cold bagel and some sugar glazed donuts so it's not even closed to a breakfast or even a snack bar. Don't Consider it breakfast included.,We stayed there for one night on June and it was a cool cozy stay.The room was clean with modern design and it had a fridge which was a bonus to us.The staff were nice and friendly.The room size was not that huge but it was just fine for 2 people.The address is obvious and the area around the hotel is very nice and safe. you can walk there at night and whenever you want and you would feel safe.It's close to the back-bay station and south station as well which was very important to us since we used buses and Amtrak.
Charlesmark Hotel,Dayse,United States of America,1 review,July 8  2017,9.2,N/A,Great cost/benefit balance. considering the average prices in Boston. I recommend for couples and solo travelers. It is small but nicely decorated. renewed. fantastic location and a nice bar downstairs for drinks and fun. I would definitely stay there again next time.
Charlesmark Hotel,Emmanuel,Israel,6 Reviews,July 2  2017,8.8,Rooms were pretty small. definitely not suited for a family but great for a couple.,Great location. Comfortable rooms. breakfast was good (beagles. cream cheese. donuts and coffee.)
Charlesmark Hotel,Theodora,Singapore,2 Reviews,June 25  2017,5.0,Noise and non-stop creaking floorboards from corridor. Stay away from rooms facing  the lift lobby.

Charlesmark Hotel,Jose,United States of America,1 review,June 24  2017,3.3,Awful rooms with no  natural light whatsoever. the views of the rooms are of a red brick wall outside making the room feel like a jail cell. Rooms are also very small.,N/A
Charlesmark Hotel,Vaninder,Singapore,16 Reviews,June 24  2017,7.9,The size of the bed is really really small.,Three good things about the place: (1) good value for money. (2) easy connectivity. and (3) reasonable sized rooms.
Charlesmark Hotel,Shane,United States of America,1 review,June 20  2017,10,All in all a really great hotel. the TV/Music/Sound system was a bit confusing (outdated?). but overall no complaints!,Great European style hotel. the breakfast was simple and ok (didn't expect much). but the location. staff. bar. etc were terrific!
Charlesmark Hotel,Franziska,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,June 20  2017,8.8,Parking was not so close by. Yet being in the city and still getting a discount on the parking fee is a good deal.,We much enjoyed the stay in Boston with the hotel providing so great access to everything. The room was small but cosi with music playing and everything needed. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The bagels for breakfast were delicious.
Charlesmark Hotel,Gillian,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,June 18  2017,8.3,Wifi a little hit and miss - worked on my phone but not my IPad. However there are a couple of desktops in the lounge so managed to do a bit of work on one of them. so not a problem.,Great location for a visit to Boston. Room was quite small but as a hotelier from London. I'm well aware of what hotel rooms are like in the cities . It had everything in it. was nicely appointed. comfortable bed and clean. which in my book are the most important aspects of a hotel stay. It was also quiet on our floor ( we had a 6th floor room at the side towards the back). It represented good value for money in comparison to many of the centrally located hotels. We didn't make the most of the inclusive breakfast but it was fine for a continental breakfast - oatmeal cereals. bagels. rolls and pastries. fresh fruit. orange juice and tea. coffee or hot chocolate. There's a nice little terrace which has drinks service from 5pm and just nice to sit at to watch the world go by. The staff were all very friendly and helpful.Would definitely consider it for future stays as it's an ideal location within 10 minutes'walk from where our son lives in South End. It's also only 10 minutes'walk from Boston Common. 5 minutes from the shops at the Prudential Centre and Copley Square and even to get the harbour side (Quincy Market / Faneuil Hall etc. it's a 25-30 minute stroll.
Charlesmark Hotel,Walid,Kuwait,9 Reviews,June 18  2017,4.6,staff r not helpful at all. room was really soooooo tiny even I booked large room. but the staff gave me two options.. if I want the large room I booked.... I have to go up a stair with my luggages. then down a stair again with my luggage to the basement. then walk through a hall way to reach my large room... or get a tiny one so I can use the elevator and make it easier for me to reach a room with all my luggages.really Bad experience.. I paid 200$ a day for this SH.. I would Pay only 160$ at Bellagio LAS VEGAS and get the best service in % stars hotel...better than this hotel "charlesMark".dont book this hotel Pals in case u have other options,location
Charlesmark Hotel,WaterLinda,Albania,28 Reviews,June 17  2017,9.2,Room too small. Late check in at 15:00,Excellent location and the staff was super polite. WiFi was working good. Check out at 12:00 was very convenient for me. Storage area provided.close by the center with all lot of coffees and bars around.
Charlesmark Hotel,Jessie,United States of America,1 review,June 13  2017,10,It really was perfect for my stay!,It was perfect for me. Nice room and bathroom. Clean. Free breakfast. Great price. A terrific location. Close to T. shopping. airport shuttle right across the street. Beautiful neighborhood. great for walking!
Charlesmark Hotel,Mary,Australia,14 Reviews,June 8  2017,6.3,The rooms are extremely small with no curtains so you wake up when the sun comes out. Breakfast is not really breakfast but more like a snack before you go out.,The hotel is relatively inexpensive for Boston. We could walk to the hop on bus stops and to the supermarket.
Charlesmark Hotel,Chazabelle,United Kingdom,25 Reviews,June 5  2017,7.9,Was expensive comparative to the quality of hotel. rooms a little dated. breakfast was a light snack. don't think this could be classified as a breakfast service (which is why we chose this hotel over an alternative),Location. very helpful staff. we were upgraded. very light with big windows. great little touches such as big DVD collection and guidebook to borrow
Charlesmark Hotel,Michaela,United States of America,3 Reviews,June 4  2017,9.6,Fridge in room too high.,Very convenient location. Room was small but just what I needed for the quick trip. Love the surround sound speakers (there was classical music playing when I entered- great touch as it set a nice mood). light dimmers. comfy bed. and  complimentary breakfast.  Though I didn't try the bar. I like the look and feel of the lounge. Seemed like a nice selection of drinks. A bit awkward being on first floor in back of lounge. but it was safe. quiet and I did book my room last minute. I like there is a fridge available but it was too high up for someone my height and I feel most others! I could barely open it.  Overall great experience and I will most definitely stay here again!
Charlesmark Hotel,Susan,United States of America,5 Reviews,June 1  2017,10,The windows don't seem to be sound proof. so even five stories up. the noise from the ally below. (room 506) is loud.,Small clean room. nice towels. friendly staff. I arrived early  and was able to check into my room. a huge plus!
Charlesmark Hotel,Pamela,United States of America,8 Reviews,May 29  2017,8.8,The room was a little small. For one night it was fine. but I think if we were staying any longer it would have been too tight for two people.,The location of the hotel is great. Boston is a very walkable city. and this hotel is in a great location for visiting any part of the city on foot. The staff was very friendly as well.
Charlesmark Hotel,Alexandre,Poland,22 Reviews,May 24  2017,5.4,Room 505. Big AC machine of the building next to the hotel working 24/7 at just 2 meters from the room window. Not a huge noise. but very annoying. constant rumour.Despite asking for a room change. no option was offered by the staff.Worst breakfast I've ever had in a hotel,Excellent location
Charlesmark Hotel,Jaime,United States of America,11 Reviews,May 18  2017,5.8,Tiny grim. room with a full size bed for my husband and myself which was way too small.If youopened the window ( onto an airshaft) the food smell from the neighboring restaurant were terrible.,the location

Charlesmark Hotel,Scruffy dog,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,May 6  2017,7.5,The room/bed were a little small and the room was quite gloomy. very little natural light and the lighting wasn't great. Would have also preferred tea/coffee in the room rather that the large stereo/DVD system but that's just personal preference,Great location. and friendly staff. Nice bar.
Charlesmark Hotel,Alan,Canada,2 Reviews,May 2  2017,10,Parking  was a distance from the hotel But with a little planning not much of an  inconvience,Very convient  great  staff Nice  modern room  very clean and quiet
Charlesmark Hotel,Fran,United Kingdom,1 review,May 2  2017,6.7,My room was overlooking Boylston Street - very. very noisy.  The wardrobe was too low for my clothing which would have been folded at the bottom (I think it's designed for shirts. trousers etc and not ladies tunic tops/dresses) Luckily there were a number of shelves on the wall that I was able to hang my clothes from to keep them crease free but it wasn't ideal.,Loved the location - very central. perfect for The Prudential Center which is essential ;-)
Charlesmark Hotel,Paul,Australia,7 Reviews,April 28  2017,7.9,Provided breakfast is just bagels and doughnuts + tea/coffee. I'm not sure how that qualifies as "continental"! Beds are very small but OK for a relatively small couple - would be uncomfortable if you are much over 6 feet. Rooms are small but that's the only way you are getting a room at this price in this location.,Location is excellent (we walked everywhere including from Boston Back Bay station to the hotel with our bags - it's a 10min walk). staff were friendly. rooms are small but reasonably well appointed. hotel and rooms were very clean.
Charlesmark Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,April 27  2017,4.6,The tiny bed and room (see photos). poor guest services and lack of quality room maintenance (see photos) made us feel we spent way to much money for what we got.The room is the smallest room we ever stayed in. We could not fit comfortably on the tiny bed and our feet literally hung off the bottom. making for a very poor night of sleep. I guess a larger bed would have taken too much floor space to allow anyone to move around the room at all. We were told this room is "standard"- It left the feeling we were in a money mill.Photos: "Closet" was tiny. chair was worn out like from a dorm room. shower head was loose in the wall. window seals were fogged with humidity.Our stay was on a Saturday and we asked staff to speak to a manager about the room issues. We were told this is the "standard" room we booked. no other rooms were available and a manager would be available  Monday. Monday? It was Saturday! There was no customer service on the manager level offered or available for days after we requested it. Days! That eventual phone call was similarly unproductive.,It is clean enough and centrally located but you pay way too much for these two basic features. especially when you consider the rest of the experience.
Charlesmark Hotel,Apostolos,Greece,21 Reviews,April 10  2017,5.4,The hotel is overvalued and surely it is much expensive for what it offers!,One lady of the staff is a great value for the hotel. The hotel is some meters away from Hynes Convention Centre and next to restaurants and stores! But the hotel is definitely overvalued!
Charlesmark Hotel,Duncan,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,April 10  2017,10,Breakfast a bit simple. but plenty of places to eat in the local area. Also. the safe in our room didn't seem to work. but it wasn't a big deal.,Excellent location. with Copley T (metro) station within a few minutes walk. and a range of restaurants and bars along Boylston Street. The Back Bay area also has a few great sights to see. like the old Trinity Church and Boston public library. which are almost within spitting distance of the hotel. If you're here during the Boston Marathon (mid April). the hotel is almost literally on the finishing line. which could be very useful or very inconvenient. depending on whether you're a runner or not!
Charlesmark Hotel,Jacqueline,United States of America,1 review,April 8  2017,5.0,While I was checking in for one night at $279. the receptionist offered a room (standard.  like mine) for $169 for that night on the phone. I was startled and honestly very angry. My room was tiny. no closet. not even a chair and no room for anything. It was clean and quiet. Breakfast is very minimal and the "lounge" is shabby. The price I pd may be a reason not to use Booking.com again.,N/A
Charlesmark Hotel,Rebecca,United States of America,1 review,April 8  2017,9.2,The shower was lukewarm the first morning and it was too bad there was no tub. but it is in a small space so that's understandable. Plus the breakfast was a bit meager.,The location and staff were wonderful
Charlesmark Hotel,Deborah,United States of America,1 review,April 5  2017,9.2,You can't change the small size or the parking situation - so nothing!,Front desk was over the top friendly and helpful!  I rate them ++++++! Excellent location. Small room - but very effecient use of space; not luxurious - but comfortable and very nice.
Charlesmark Hotel,pitic852000,Ireland,2 Reviews,April 5  2017,6.7,- Room given initially was very small; lady in reception was very kind and changed our room to a slightly bigger one. unfortunately there was no wardrobe to put your clothes in; - Bathroom utilities (shampoo/ shower gel) were only changed once in 5 days.. - booking price didn't include the VAT which was a good amount of the total cost (so need to consider this as well when booking)- no gym facilities,- location was fantastic. close to subway and close available shuttle bus to the airport;- breakfast was very basic but free of charge;- Audio system in the room was very nice and could have the option of choosing through different types of music and have stereo in the toilet- small lovely evening bar available in reception
Charlesmark Hotel,Rosie Raftery,Ireland,22 Reviews,April 4  2017,6.7,Walls are very thin - we could hear upstairs and next door neighbors. The breakfast was very basic.,The location was great. Easy access to T. Nice bathroom.
Charlesmark Hotel,Kyle,United States of America,1 review,March 31  2017,9.2,TV was in a weird location (way high up and far away from the bed) and the breakfast was mediocre.,The room was clean and had an advanced sound system!  It was piped throughout the room and even into the bathroom!
Charlesmark Hotel,Rosa,United States of America,7 Reviews,March 27  2017,10,My only recommendation would be to expand the bar bites. The only food selection is flatbread pizza (which by the way. was delicious).,I was very pleased with this little boutique hotel. The location is excellent. I like the homey feel. small bar. comfy breakfast area. clean. modern rooms. great bathroom. The room was small. but perfect for my needs. Solo woman traveling alone. felt very safe. I will recommend it to anyone who is traveling to Boston.
Charlesmark Hotel,Michael,United States of America,1 review,March 18  2017,7.9,The queen room is pretty darn small with no closets and only 2 hooks to hang items (seriously?). The bathroom suffers from also being very tight with the shower door opening at an awkward angle to the bathroom door. Also. while some folks might like the quaint feeling of using an actual door key. a key card would be much more efficient to carry around. I did also have a couple ants crawl on my towel in the bathroom. but not a huge deal.,The TV/stereo setup with built in surround sound speakers was amazing! Shower was super sexy (great shower head pressure). but very small. Staff was very friendly. and the bed was very comfy! Amenities were also great!
Charlesmark Hotel,Reviewer,United States of America,1 review,March 16  2017,7.5,The mirrors in the hotel room were hung at a downward angle and so they were very unflattering. My partner and I joked about this throughout our stay but it was kind of a bummer because it took up so much of the wall!,Location was great!
Charlesmark Hotel,Martina,Sweden,10 Reviews,March 13  2017,8.3,Minor things. The fridge made a bit of noise occasionally. and I found no easy way of turning it off. There's a bar downstairs which was rather busy in the evenings. It makes someone like me rush to the elevator. but if you like walking right into a party after a day out. it's great!,Nice staff. no problem at all to leave or bags at the hotel before check-in and after check-out. I really liked the breakfast bagels. so for me the relatively few breakfast options was not a problem (a cream cheese bagel a day makes me happy). There was also several varieties of bagels. that counts for something. In addition. jam. donuts. fresh fruit. and instant oatmeal in different flavors was available. I read an earlier review saying "at least serve oatmeal!". so it seems like they listen to feedback.We were attending a convention at Hynes during the weekend. so the location was perfect! Close to a subway station. too. I recommend visiting the library across the street. Go inside and walk around.
Charlesmark Hotel,Cynthia,United States of America,5 Reviews,March 9  2017,9.2,The continental breakfast. Wish there was more options and varieties. Just had bagel donuts coffee and juice. Nothing to write home about.,I loved the location. there was so much to do and such a great neighborhood. The staff was friendly and helpful.
Charlesmark Hotel,Victoria,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,March 6  2017,8.3,Towels a little too small. Breakfast was only bagels and donuts - not a great start before an all day conference.,The room was a good size and shower excellent. Good location for attending a conference and staff were friendly.

Charlesmark Hotel,William,United States of America,55 Reviews,February 20  2017,10,N/A,The location of this property in the Back Bay area is superb -- everything is walkable and/or easy to access via the subway.  The room was quiet and cozy and very well designed.  This is a wonderful boutique style hotel at a good price for this location in a major city!
Charlesmark Hotel,Aase,United States of America,2 Reviews,February 18  2017,9.6,Nothing.  We loved it!,Everything was wonderful.  The location was close to the T station &amp; shopping. The room was really clean and well set up.  Great view right across from the Marathon finish line.  Would absolutely recommend it and stay there again.
Charlesmark Hotel,Christine,United States of America,2 Reviews,February 17  2017,10,N/A,The wifi connection in my room was loose and disconnected during the Inauguration weekend. But the nightclerk (red-haired Irish lass) tried very hard to fix it for me. In the morning William &lt;3 came in and tried to fix it.
Charlesmark Hotel,Phillip,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,February 13  2017,5.4,The WiFi was terrible  - couldn't barely stream Netflix. The breakfast was paltry: bagels were rock hard. the coffee was low quality. and there wasn't anything else! This was barely "continental" and I've stayed in hostels with better wifi and breakfast.,The room was relatively clean. but there was a used condom on the bathroom floor... gross!
Charlesmark Hotel,Michelle,United States of America,1 review,February 9  2017,10,The pillows were flat,It was a great location close to everything.  The bathroom was newly remodeled and beautiful! The bed was average but I got good night's sleep.
Studio on Arch Street Apt 4A,Maria,Ireland,13 Reviews,June 22  2017,10,No lift on Sunday when we arrived so had to carry bags up the stairs.,It's right in the centre of Boston with everything you need on your door step. Bright airy and spotlessly clean apartment that was just perfect for our stay in the city.

Constitution Inn,Anonymous,Panama,1 review,October 31  2017,7.1,Arriving at night. to an unknown area. it seemed that I was in a dangerous area.  Very little lighting in general and few people.  The hotel sign is not clearly visible from the road.,N/A
Constitution Inn,John,United States of America,5 Reviews,October 31  2017,5.8,Parking. availability of breakfast. nicer staff at reception.,Staff. actually just one girl at desk. not very helpful about parking questions. The room was clean and comfortable but the hair dryer was broken but they quickly brought up a replacement. I realize the prices in Boston are higher but didn't feel this property was worth the money.
Constitution Inn,Caryl,United States of America,19 Reviews,October 30  2017,7.9,N/A,The facility is much better than I expected.  My flight was cancelled due to the bad weather. and I could only found this place which was 3.2 miles away from the airport with my &lt;$100 budget.  I love the Bistro that's only a block away from the facility. nice food nice staff nice price there.
Constitution Inn,Adam,Australia,2 Reviews,October 27  2017,7.5,There was a mess of coffee grinds when we arrived near the cooking facilities. and hot water was sometimes non existent...,Nice size room on the top floor. Was great for us and our toddler with room for him to run around a little bit. We bought and used a port-a-cot during our trip. Some reviews indicate no air-conditioning. however we had a central ducted system in our room.
Constitution Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 23  2017,8.3,First night came in late elevator to our floor was not working needed to get off on 3rd and take stairs to 5th- Hallway smelled like bleach from pool.,The area was real nice -it was clean and safe close to coffee and nice things to .easy walking to places and water taxi.room was clean quiet and large
Constitution Inn,Veronique,Netherlands,8 Reviews,October 20  2017,4.6,Reception staff was really unpolite. Never seen someting link this before. Forgot my ipad jn the room. since than it took them 10 days to find it in the laundry which was inside the hotel. Called them often. or they did not replay or they answered and afterwards hang up randomly. Alsno no or late replay on emails. They where extreemly unwilling to help or provide any service.,The location was oke. bed was oke and room was fine.
Constitution Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 18  2017,5.8,There was a stain on our bed sheets. stains all over our curtains. and a stain on the ceiling. Hotel had an overall outdated and worn down look.,Location was great! Next to shipyard and close to downtown.
Constitution Inn,Anonymous,Australia,1 review,October 17  2017,7.5,The hotel is a bit isolated so there are not many nearby dining options.,Good sized room and a comfortable bed. Having a refrigerator and microwave in the room was very handy.
Constitution Inn,Jeanne,United States of America,9 Reviews,October 15  2017,8.3,Parking is two blocks away. only 10$ and is safe walking.,Great location! Can walk the freedom trail from hotel. Nice and clean for being a older building. Operated by the ymca. so free ymca use attached to hotel.
Constitution Inn,Jonathan,Israel,6 Reviews,October 14  2017,3.3,the room was not clean. the trash can in the bathroom was not emptied after the previous guests.... also the bathtub wasn't cleaned and we got a "pleasant" welcome of the previous guests hair all over it. after those sights none of us dared to use it.moreover - our room had an awful moldy odor and there wasn't any way to hold the window open to fresh the atmosphere. the walls between the rooms are very thin and we could hear the noises from the next room - especially every time they had the water running in the sink or flushed the toilets. there was a discrepancy from the way booking.com presented the room as a room suitable for 4+1 guests (as we were 2 adults and 3 children - all ages were specified in advanced). but apparently the app considers 3 children in a regular double bed as a good idea. it is not. it seems that although booking.com considered the room suitable for 4+1 guests. once we've asked for an extra bed to fit  our 3rd child the hotel claimed that the fine prints in the hotel policy is to charge an extra $15 for such request. that means that for our kind of family group the price that the app had shown for this hotel was simply wrongyou'd better double and triple check it before making any reservation through the app,N/A
Constitution Inn,Tricia,United Kingdom,1 review,October 14  2017,3.3,The staff could have greeted us when we arrived and when we asked questions.  The room had not been decorated for maybe 20 years and had an ancient bathroom with a cracked shower and the smallest basin ever.,The ferry ride into Boston
Constitution Inn,Anonymous,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,October 12  2017,4.6,THE HOTEL IS VERY BASIC AND IN NEED OF REPAIR. THE ROOM WASNT VERY CLEAN. THE RECEPTION STAFF WERE VERY MISERABLE AND UNHELPFUL.,THE LOCATION TO BOSTON CITY WAS GREAT ABOUT A 20 TO 30 MIN WALK TAKING YOU STRAIGHT INTO THE NORTHEND. THE SURROUNDING AREA TO THE HOTEL IS PRETTY BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE BAR/RESTAURANT.
Constitution Inn,Annalisa,United States of America,4 Reviews,October 12  2017,3.8,This place is probably pretty tempting. It's cheaper than anything else centrally located. the photos look okay. it looks like it's close to downtown. However. don't be fooled. Just go ahead and pay the $50 more a night to stay at a Holiday Inn or a Best Western. This place is not worth whatever you will save. First. the place is not well cleaned/maintained. in addition to being old and worn out. We had to be moved rooms three times before we got one that didn't have hair and stains on the sheets. The bathroom was full of rust and the linoleum was coming up. All three rooms smelled heavily of mildew. Everything in the room is cheap. cheap sheets. cheap toilet paper. cheap towels. The lights flicker and the outlets are damaged. The elevator kept stopping and got stuck while we were in it at one point. All of these things seem like small things but combined it made this place feel very dingy and unwelcoming.  Second. The location is terrible. there is nothing nearby. no food. no grocery stores (except for 7-11). no coffee shops. no public transportation options. etc. The only thing in the neighborhood is docks and abandoned warehouses. Additionally. the hotel does not provide breakfast. so if you wake up hungry you have venture quite far away. Get in on a late flight and feeling peckish? Hope you like 7-11 hot dogs. Lastly. the staff is pretty uninterested and unhelpful. But. I can't really blame them. They have to know this place is a bit of a dump.In summary. pony up the extra $50 night to stay at a Hampton Inn or somewhere with that has the decency to have better tissues and provide a waffle iron and cold cereal in their lobby.,Did not care for this hotel. but it is a cheaper option in a very expensive city.
Constitution Inn,Anonymous,Canada,2 Reviews,October 10  2017,3.8,Hotel is poorly maintained. Bathrooms are old and show signs of mildew. Rugs in room are dark in colour. but can't conceal lack of upkeep. Bedskirts are filthy. Price to value horrible.,Proximity to freedom trail

Constitution Inn,Monica,United States of America,1 review,October 9  2017,5.4,parking being two blocks away . that wasnt noted when i book. The coffee machine in the room didnt have filters or the right coffee bag . We couldnt make coffee.Elevators took too long and we didnt have access using the statirs to the 5th floor.Front desk staff should be  etyer imformed sbout the nearby attractions. We asked a few simple questions but they couldn't answer. Maybe give them a some  training as what to say to guests when they ask ablut about quincy market and the tipical places in Boston:,Location and being cclose to the marina
Constitution Inn,Wayne,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,October 9  2017,8.8,The staff at reception could do with smiling a bit &amp; looking [ if not actually feeling] a bit more enthusiastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The room was large. clean &amp; very quiet. even though we faced the road &amp; were above the hotel entrance. The staff were friendly enough but seemed bored ! The hotel is in the old Navy Yard area. so loads of historic buildings. newly converted to apartments &amp; offices.....lovely cobbled pedestrian tree lined boulevard outside the back entrance . leading to a bistro  &amp; a 7-11. A few blocks down on the waterfront is a great restaurant &amp; bar [Pier 6]with stunning views of the city from across the harbour. while a little further along is the USS Constitution ship &amp; museum. There is a free shuttle from 13th St that'll take you to North Station [around a 10 min ride]in Boston. The YMCA next door to the hotel has a great gym &amp; swimming pool which guests can use free of charge &amp; down in the basement is a large laundry which came in very handy.
Constitution Inn,Rhonda,United States of America,1 review,October 8  2017,4.2,No hot water or heat!  Bathroom floor dirty. No Soap to wash hands or take a shower!  Pillowcases were stained!  Elevators weren't working properly. had to wait 15 mins.for elevator to open!  No cups for the coffee!  Staff were not friendly or helpful!  No info for WiFi password in room. I had to call the front desk to get it.  I requested a quiet room and they gave me a room next to the elevator. which was very noisy with people talking loud at 5:30 am.  and constant dinging from elevator!,Convenience of location only!
Constitution Inn,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,October 8  2017,8.3,It was a shame no breakfast was available - though I was forewarned. The plumbing system was also quite noisy.,Very friendly helpful staff on duty on arrival. who told me about the shuttle to North Station. and how to get to Bunker Hill. and which map was best.
Constitution Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 5  2017,7.1,Needs updating. especially the bathrooms. Evening staff was lackadaisical. Morning staff very attentive.,Good location - close to airport without high rates for hotels serviced by free shuttle. It was a $15 taxi ride to the airport. Property was clean and convenient to the North End and historic sights.
Constitution Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 5  2017,7.5,There wasn’t a good place within walking distance to eat breakfast. There was only Dunkin Donuts and Style Cafe which was awful. We would have liked a Sunday Brunch.,The bed was very comfortable. Housekeeper was friendly.
Constitution Inn,April,United States of America,4 Reviews,October 5  2017,5.8,Not many restaurant's close by. Getting to and from an evening Event in Boston was difficult and pricey.,Proximity to Navy yard and Constition Museum was great. Water shuttle to downtown Boston was great.
Constitution Inn,Heather,Australia,1 review,October 5  2017,5.4,Very noisy hotel. Next room partied until 01:45! Doors to rooms were being opened and banged closed constantly. I think a lot of guests knew each other and were in and out of each other's rooms and talking very loudly. Noise of gym equipment very noisy. Sounded like furniture above us were scraping on the floor then being dropped.  We were very tired from lack of sleep,location
Constitution Inn,Renee,United States of America,6 Reviews,October 4  2017,8.3,The hotel is pretty basic and there are not a lot of amenities except for a good exercise room. The  staff was just okay. they just did their basic job but were not overly helpful even if you asked a specific question.,This is hotel is located in the historic shipyard so if you want to do things in that area it is a good location.  The rooms were clean and comfortable and it is very quiet so you can rest well.
Constitution Inn,Fay,Australia,5 Reviews,October 3  2017,10,More time in Boston !!!I think it was your hotel which didn't have an electric kettle - needed for us tea drinkers!,The position was excellent and staff were helpful with directions.
Constitution Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 2  2017,6.7,The staff took a while to even acknowledge me at the check in counter. The beds weren't very comfortable.,The place was clean and cheap. I found free street parking right out front for the weekend. otherwise would have had to pay $10 to park in a garage. Good location. close to downtown without being in the noisiest spot.
Constitution Inn,J,United States of America,6 Reviews,September 29  2017,6.3,The pool didnt work at all and we specifically wanted a place with a pool.Room was fairly small. No parking.  You have to walk a block and a half away to the closest parking garage .,A lot of history right in one small area .
Constitution Inn,Anonymous,Germany,5 Reviews,September 28  2017,7.1,We were in a room with (double) doors to the next room. We were able to hear quite well what those at the other side of the door were saying.,Overall the hotel was about half the price of the next best alternative for a short term booking for one night.  There is no breakfast offered in this hotel. but a 5 minute walk away is the style cafe. A probably family owned cafe with friendly owners and offering a surprisingly good breakfast for a reasonable price (10 USD). I would like to recommend this option!
Constitution Inn,The_Bishop,United Kingdom,38 Reviews,September 28  2017,6.7,This place had reasonable reviews on booking.com. it was only after I'd booked the hotel and was on my way there we read some Google reviews which made me worried about the place. the "hotel" houses homeless women and children on the second floor. on check in we were given a room on the second floor next to a locked door to the homeless section. we asked reception about it. and they said they knew nothing about it. The first room we were given was awful. dark and dingy with a broken cooker in the room. they said it was a kitchen but it wasn't. it was just a broken cooker!!  We went back to the front desk and said the room was unacceptable. and we were given a better room on the top floor. it also had a "kitchen" area with sink. cooker. fridge and cupboards. but no pots and pans. so as most people don't travel with cooking utensils it was pretty useless!!Although the second room was better. it still had wires hanging out of the wall. and it didn't really feel like a hotel. just somewhere that rented rooms out to whoever. more like a flop house.  I wish I'd spent more to stay in the centre of Boston. especially as the prices dropped if we'd left the booking till the day of arrival.,Reasonable location close to the USS Constitution. could get a ferry to the aquarium for $3.50. or about a mile or so walk to the centre of Boston. nice pub nearby. the Blackmore bar and kitchen. just before the bridge. and parking at $10 a day although a short walk away.
Constitution Inn,Marshall,United States of America,1 review,September 28  2017,4.6,Room was expensive and badly needs an update. It was so out of date. I haven't stayed in a hotel this bad of shape in 20 years.,Check in person was very courteous and knowledgeable.
Constitution Inn,Richard,United Kingdom,13 Reviews,September 26  2017,7.9,Awkward to get there by public transport after 8.00 pm when the ferry ends. Bus to navy yard gate is good. but infrequent.,Excellent location for Navy Yard. USS Constitution. Bunker Hill. Charlestown

BUT no window like the photo showed on booking com and that's why I chose it for the view ?Very nice toiletries selection In shower It was like an attic low ceiling roof  room way up 6 thbfloor with no window just a sky light !It was half price for that night thank goodness! Des not worth 251 dollars !
Constitution Inn,Lee,United States of America,1 review,September 25  2017,6.7,Facilities are old. The room had only 2 roof windows. so no view...

Constitution Inn,Dewitt,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 24  2017,3.8,The room was filthy.  Lurid stains in the cloth chair. Bugs crawling on the floor and wall (literally)! Crud caked in the corners of the bathroom floor.  Tepid shower water temperature.  The entire facility is run down. beat up and nasty looking.  If I didn't get lice I'll be lucky.,The price of $119 per night lured me in.  It went south from there.
Constitution Inn,John,Australia,8 Reviews,September 24  2017,7.9,I don't appreciate booking in taxis for the following day and the staff book them in for the day after then when I ask one of them to cancel the booking for the wrong day they do not even do it?!?,There were only 3 staff who were helpful and not sour. Josh and 2 others only.
Constitution Inn,Paula,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 22  2017,6.7,Room was big but a little uncomfortable. Not recommended for someone tall. Bathroom outdated. Shower door did not close.coffee was awful.,Exercise and swim would have been nice but we didn't use it.

Constitution Inn,Nelle,United States of America,25 Reviews,September 20  2017,6.7,The room is tired and needs an overhaul. Our room needs fresh paint and a thorough cleaning. Carpet curling up in corners. Food splashed on wall. dresser very chipped and scratched. dust/dirt accumulated on ledges. etc. I used a washcloth to clean.,The room was spacious with a fridge and microwave. which was handy for several days' stay. Great use of the YMCA attached to same building. Beds comfortable. Location is quiet. Friendly staff. luggage storage and comfy resting area available. Used Lyft/Uber for getting closer to town.
Constitution Inn,D,United States of America,1 review,September 19  2017,2.9,There was blood spatter in the bathroom- we couldn't get an extra blanket or pillow. The staff was non-responsive and indifferent. I would never recommend this place to anyone- not to mention friends/colleagues.,Not much
Constitution Inn,Susan,United States of America,1 review,September 18  2017,7.5,Originally we were put in a room on the sixth floor which was not good.

Constitution Inn,Maura,Ireland,1 review,September 16  2017,6.3,No shops or bars nearby. Don't know why cooker fridge etc advertised. No dish or cutlery there,One lady on reception with brown hair more interested in her mobile than answering a question The others were excellent

Constitution Inn,Debra,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 13  2017,4.2,The property was not clean. There appeared to be blood on the ceiling or at least something that was brownish red.

Constitution Inn,Anonymous,Netherlands,11 Reviews,September 9  2017,5.4,The staff is not that friendly. The Spanish guy at the front desk is not friendly at all. The hotel is quite old and I believe the price is very high for what you get.The bed sheets and the bathroom could get some extra cleaning,The bed was confortable and the room was big. with windows on the roof. There is a free shuttle to the city center every 15 or 30 min depending on the time of the day
Constitution Inn,Cuchullain,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,September 9  2017,7.1,Tried to extend our stay and room rate doubled,You could disembark the plane and catch a boat across the Charles River to hotel. Best way to arrive in a city.
Constitution Inn,Seattle,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 8  2017,4.2,Place is very poorly maintained.  Lightbulbs in two fixture out. phone face missing. missing cup holder in bathroom with hardware left hanging on wall. bathroom heater face rusted and sticking out so that it could easily cut someone.The refrigerator door had been left open. so it had thawed completely. and the alarm clock was off by nearly 1/2 hour.  Had someone not noticed this. they could have easily missed an important appointment.On check-in I was told to give front desk 20 minutes notice to call ahead for taxi.  The taxi driver said they need only 5 minutes so he was waiting for me by the time I got to the lobby.On check out. my receipt was waiting for me (I'd paid in advance). but I didn't notice until later than I'd received some else's receipt.  Incompetence.,The towels and wash cloths were surprisingly good.  The bedsheets were clean.
Constitution Inn,Justin,United States of America,1 review,September 7  2017,9.6,The only thing that was frustrating was parking. It's about a 5 minute walk to the garage and you cannot always access your vehicle if you need it or something out of it.,We enjoyed the location. close to many attractions. Great view from our room of Boston.
Constitution Inn,Karen,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,September 7  2017,7.1,Staff were efficient but not very welcoming or warm.,Bargain hotel for a short stay in Boston in an historically interesting and quiet area. Rooms are comfortable and roomy if like us you're travelling with kids. For breakfast there's a Dunkin Donuts and a 7/11 nearby. Parking is in a covered car park for 10 dollars per day. Also handy for visiting USS Constitution and Bunkers Hill and walking the freedom trail. Boston is a lovely city. Go see it!
Constitution Inn,Sean,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,September 4  2017,6.3,We spent our first night in Boston at the Constitution Inn leaving the next day to catch a ferry to Cape Cod! On boarding the ferry I realised I had left my jacket hanging in the wardrobe of the room. I emailed the hotel to inform them that I would be returning for a second stay the following week and please could they put my jacket in a safe place until I returned. Very sadly we were told my jacket had not been found which was not very reassuring from a security point of view and this sadly left us with concerns about other personal belongings for the remainder of our stay.,The room was clean and spacious and the location was very quiet. affording a peaceful nights sleep. Although we didn't make use of the facilities there was a car park. a guest launderette. a gym and a pool. The hotel was 5 minutes walk from the USS Constitution Ship in dock and a very interesting interactive museum. relating the history of the ship. There were numerous ways of getting to the centre of Boston which was approximately 45 mins on foot. 10 mins by ferry.
Constitution Inn,Emily,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,September 4  2017,8.8,/,Very good place to stay. had no problems. The room was spacious with a microwave and fridge for your convenience. the beds were comfortable and it was quiet outside so we didn't ever get disturbed. I would recommend!

Constitution Inn,Felicia,United States of America,1 review,August 31  2017,7.5,N/A,Parking is hard if with a family since it's around the block. Staff was great. Beds are not that comfortable but not the worst. Good location if walking through Charlestown or North End/Waterfront area.
Constitution Inn,Mark,United States of America,1 review,August 29  2017,8.3,The elevator was slow and at times the floor call button did not work so it would take even longer to get an elevator.,It's not a swanky place but it was clean and in an excellent location for the price--a great value.
Constitution Inn,Joseph,United States of America,1 review,August 28  2017,9.6,N/A,Location is perfect and for how inexpensive. I was extremely surprised by the staff. rooms. cleanliness. etc. Less than 5 minute walk to a restaurant right on one on the piers on the Boston Harbor. Will be back!
Constitution Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 28  2017,8.8,The parking was close. directions not clear. and it was difficult to pay at end of parking. Eating in the area was mixed. Could have provided better directions to near by food.,WE booked because of the location. Wanted to be near the Navy Yard and we were leaving on a cruise at the end of our stay from a pier very close to the hotel.
Constitution Inn,George,United States of America,1 review,August 24  2017,9.6,Nothing negative.,Staff was very helpful.public transportation is not very convenient but there is a free shuttle bus to and from hotel to center of town.  Great internet.  Uber service very convenient to cruise ship.

Constitution Inn,Dana,United States of America,7 Reviews,August 15  2017,8.8,It is in Boston so of course it was expensive. For the price it would’ve been nice to get even a small continental breakfast and longer pool hours. Parking was a little weird. having to walk a block and a half away for the garage. Although having to pay for parking. they do validate and it’s only $10 for every 24 hours (or exit/entry).,All of the amenities were there. We used the fridge and microwave. which worked well. Surprisingly. we were also given a room with an oven and range. Had we known ahead of time we would have utilized that. but they couldn’t confirm prior to our trip. so we didn’t bring food to cook on stovetop. Room felt spacious. even with four guests.
Constitution Inn,Alasdair,United Kingdom,1 review,August 14  2017,5.4,decor in the rooms did feel old. quite expensive and I found cheaper pricing on other websites once we had booked on booking.com,Location was good. but hotel adequate. room big but not well decorated or felt particularly up to date. WIFI was adequate throughout hotel
Constitution Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 12  2017,6.7,Since the pool is tied to YMCA hours and rules. hard for kids' free play/swim. Delivery options for dinner were limited.,The nearby parking garage was convenient and economical for an overnight stay that carried into more city exploration the next day. Easy walk to MGH cafeteria for breakfast. Navy Yard for USS Constitution. and ferry to Long Wharg and the aquarium.
Constitution Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 6  2017,8.8,There wasn't any regular coffee in the room when we arrived.  I told the clerk at the front desk and was was helped out right away.,The location and the price were great!  The staff was very helpful and accommodating!
Constitution Inn,Dan,Belgium,16 Reviews,August 3  2017,6.7,The isolation of rooms is minimal. If you are lucky to have civilised neighbors great but we didn't and we could not sleep til 2am. It was like they were in the same room. We were 4 persons but got only 2 towels despite asking express the cleaning lady. Quite expensive but this due to general prices in Boston.,The hotel was quite clean. nice room. decent bathroom and TV despite some negative reviews. Parking was close and at 10$ per day was acceptable for Boston. They had cold water with fruit aroma in the lobby.
Constitution Inn,Manuela,Switzerland,1 review,August 2  2017,6.3,Our room smelled rather moldy and musty. but we got used to it... It looks all a bit old and worn out. but it is ok for the prize.My husband told the man at the desk to have an eye on his luggage in the lobby during the 15 minutes he went to get the car from the garage. Later he realized. that his back up drive got stolen and remembered that the man at the desk wasn't there anymore when he got back from the garage.So either this man stole it or he didn't pay attention to the lugagge and somebody else stole it. The back up drive was in the outside pocket (not an especially safe place. we know...)  Luckily it is not all that bad. there is another copy back home. but still. it was a very annoying and disappointing experience. We wouldn't come back.,The best thing about the Motel: it is conveniently located and it is not expensive.
Constitution Inn,Margaux,United States of America,6 Reviews,August 1  2017,8.8,It would be better to have a Parking dedicated to the hotel but it is not very far and only $10,Amazing location - easy access to the ferry that goes straight to the city. clean room. great equipment in the room (kitchenette)
Constitution Inn,Carla,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 1  2017,7.9,There was a minimal fee for parking that we did not expect.,Great location - near the waterfront and within walking distance of a subway station.  Quiet and safe area of the city.

Constitution Inn,Richard,Canada,1 review,July 28  2017,7.1,The elevator took a long time to access. There was no bathroom counter.  Parking situation inconvenient. No offer of any information at front desk regarding shuttle to north station. Only upon inquiring about public transportation access were we advised of shuttle by front desk staff.,Clean room.  Free shuttle to north station. Location good.
Constitution Inn,Jessica,United States of America,1 review,July 26  2017,2.9,Expensive and crappy. They "have a pool". But what theydon't tell you is that it is ymca and kids cannot freely use it.Parents must be in the pool. even when child is wearing a life vest.unless they can pass a swim test. Pool is also roped off for lapswimming. Not family friendly. Very disappointed. I wish I could get mymoney back and go elsewhere. Nothing good to report. Manager and moststaff super unhelpful. unapologetic. and unfriendly. Save yourself thestress. don't stay here!!!!,Expensive and crappy. They "have a pool".

Constitution Inn,Anne,Australia,12 Reviews,July 26  2017,4.6,You need to have your own vehicle or be prepared to catch a couple of buses anywhere!! And none of the buses come directly past the hotel. With one exception. a young lady with blonde hair. the reception staff were a bit "snooty" and indifferent. The "Breakfast Room" is so different from the photo they have displayed that it's a joke!! Everything is paper with plastic cutlery. It's a "bun fight" trying to get anything as the room is so small. There is never enough room for everyone to sit so many people end up balancing there food on trays and taking them to  their rooms.,The room was spacious and in reasonably good order. o too was the bathroom. I was given a quiet room as requested.
Constitution Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 24  2017,5.8,The facility is old and tired the beds are not great and the elevators are in poor working condition.  The only elevator that goes above the 2nd floor failed with a load of people and the fire department came to rescue them.  The elevator was put our of commission and we had to walk up.  This is apparently not a rare occurrence.,The location is great.
Constitution Inn,Susan,United States of America,1 review,July 24  2017,10,The parking garage was two blocks away and if I had not been able to move to the street later that night(weekend night). it would have been even worse. I thought we had free parking but it was $10. I know that is not bad for a city but a surprise to me anyway.,I liked the cleanliness of the room and other parts of hotel. The location was great for what we whated to see and do. The fridge &amp; microwave in the room was a plus.
Constitution Inn,Desiray,United States of America,1 review,July 22  2017,6.7,Drainage in tub was poor. air conditioner was poor (didn't get cold). Didn't clean room. No transportation from airport. Little to none food in area.,Clean. staff friendly. Less cost than other hotels.
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Jonathan,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 24  2017,4.6,The reception was poor. Despite communicating with the company. the concierge would not handover the keys as he had not received a confirmatory email. The appartment was tired and the sofa bed only just adequate. Parking was expensive- $38 per night. There is also a hidden expense. not immediately apparent when booking. of $105 for cleaning! Consequently what is advertised as $375 suddenly becomes over $500.,Only the location. It was close to the airport and in a â€˜happeningâ€™ area by the docks.
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Anonymous,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,October 21  2017,8.8,Only negative with the booking is the name of apartments. Apartments are called One Park Lane which is where taxi sat nav took us. but we were looking for Boston Harbour view Apartments which is name on booking. Could have saved time and effort if building name was on booking. Otherwise no complaints.,Apartment was lovely. very clean. everything you would need for holiday.very good locations. easy walk into central Boston and great to be down by water.
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Ehakim,Indonesia,7 Reviews,October 20  2017,8.8,A bit complicated for checking-in because this is actually a private residence so you need to call their staff in advance prior to checking-in so they can handed over the key. So probably a bit complicated for foreign tourist,N/A
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Anonymous,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 15  2017,7.1,Could not find property when we arrived. The name and address given was not correct. Not sure if this is fault of Pelican Stay the agency or Booking.com please note the name and address is: SEAPORT APARTMENTS. Park Avenue not Boston Harbor View Luxury Apartments. D St and Northern Ave. it was extremely stressful trying to find the apartments. couldn't get hold of site supervisor on phone (clicking into answerphone) and Pelted can Stay office out us on hold and never came back to us. Concierge did not know where we were booked in and it was quite some time before we found where we were supposed to be.Secondly the apartment was large and clean but many things were tattyand broken- wouldn't describe it as 'luxury''!Thirdly Pelican Stay never stopped emailing us the whole time about insignificant things - very irritating.,Location in seaport good. near to T stop (fantastic). quiet. great bed. kitchen well equipped
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Sven,Germany,2 Reviews,October 8  2017,7.5,Impossible booking process. Booking with credit card that has different name than guest not possible. Even with card that has name of guest still have to sign and fax in proof. Numerous calls to confirm arrival. Very annoying and our reason never too book this place again.,N/A
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Anonymous,Canada,1 review,October 6  2017,8.3,I didnâ€™t like having to send a picture of my drivers license and credit card - never had to do that before and it was annoying and off putting. Also the janky form on adobe sign was really frustrating and unnecessary.,I liked the view from the room
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Amer,Saudi Arabia,5 Reviews,October 4  2017,5.8,Parking is expensive. $36/day and its not flexible. in/out new ticket!No dedicated front desk available for guests. the only contact available is via phone so anything you need you have to call and wait another day.,Reasonable size of rooms and comfort. Location is good.
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Philip,United Kingdom,60 Reviews,September 29  2017,6.7,This not like a hotel in any way. My taxi from the airport cost $40 (rather than about $15) as the building has NO sign 'Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites'. We drove around for 20-30 mins looking for the property at my expense. www.booking.com ought to deal with this as the name is more of an advert and is NOT the name of the property. Even then. there was no harbor view from the apartment. Near the the harbor would be a better description.There is no reception when you arrive. the concierge deals with you. However. he could not find my booking until I spotted my name on a piece of paper. He had to call an office 2 or 3 times as there was no key available to get into the apartment. Eventually. he found a key. I went up to the room and realised that the apartment was actually occupied and someone was asleep in a bedroom. He had give me the key to the wrong block. so we walked the short distance outside to the right block. Again. the key took time to locate. For this poor service. I had to pay an extra $25 as it was after 9pm.The heating was hard to control - there were no instructions. so I had to suffer a warm apartment.The day before check out I asked if there were any arrangements to store my luggage on my last day before leaving. I was told that I could keep the luggage in the room until 4pm. When I tried to do this the next day. I was told I had to leave before the check out time on my booking. There is no storage available for luggage.The agency that manages the property sends you copious information before you arrive and you have to send and sign guarantees and pay deposits. This is not like booking a hotel with booking.com. It's not a convenient transaction and comes with a lot of paperwork beforehand. This is not ideal for a busy businessman.I complained to the agency about the above but got a fairly disinterested response.,Comfortable apartment close to the harbour with plenty of places to eat and drink nearby. There's also a convenient grocery store nearby. The accommodation is to a good standard.
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Bradley,United Kingdom,1 review,September 27  2017,6.3,Fridge did not work for two days of our stay.Engineer arrived a day late. by which point we'd already fixed it.The agent via email did not particularly care about the inconvenience.There was also terrible communication leading up to the trip with the agents chasing payment. We had already paid via Booking.com and despite it stating they would charge cleaning fees separately. they had already taken the full amount.Paying via this site is meant to reduce admin with the agents of the property. but this was the worst yet!,Very good location. clean and good shops located nearby.
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Anonymous,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,September 26  2017,8.8,The only negative comment I  can make was the nature of the communication from Pelican - I regard it  as too officious and remote.,The apartment was clean. safe and comfortable. It  was convenient for central Boston and all the major sites. The concierge service was particularly friendly and helpful.
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Geoffrey,Australia,81 Reviews,September 6  2017,5.8,Address of apartment different from what advised on booking.com.  no curtains and blinds did not keep out light at night or sun during the day. Manager did not bother to meet us and had to walk about trying to find the other apartment block. Apartment was new once but quite knocked about for an supposed luxury suite. Choose somewhere else that is better value and guess friendly,Good location to seaport area
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Barbara,United States of America,1 review,August 28  2017,7.5,Very poor communication with local rep.

Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Pdl67,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,July 22  2017,7.5,the parking was very expensive so we returned the hire car early and walked everywhere.

Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Marianne,Ireland,8 Reviews,July 22  2017,7.9,There was to many emails looking for this. that and the other. Was told to ring 30 mins before we arrived. rang the contact number we were given numerous times but no answer.  Four of us staying in apartment but only one key and one fob. The bed was lovely but the sofa bed was very uncomfortable.The over all price of the apartment was a lot more than I had expected. This was my own fault but its just a warning to everyone to make sure and read the total cost before you book.,Had everything we needed in the apartment. Bus to South Station was 2 mins away.

Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Stefano,Italy,24 Reviews,July 9  2017,4.2,Insane check in. nobody is waiting for you when you got there.

Then. you are going to be asked to give a picture of your passport and credit card through unsafe ways. The apartment's view are suburbs. parking. sheds and the highway.

Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,William,United States of America,1 review,June 25  2017,7.5,Communication is very poor. Multiple emails saying the same thing regarding the stay are unnecessary.  I received 5 emails to let the host know when I was arriving which were all answered. and still was late to get into the apartment. Received 3 email contracts that were signed and still had to sign a paper one once I arrived.,The apartment was clean.
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Mercy,United States of America,1 review,June 19  2017,10,N/A,The area where is located is excellent! A lot of restaurantes. the ocean is just across the street. and the bus that stop behind the property takes you to the airport in 10min!
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Vijay Ekanathan,United States of America,1 review,June 13  2017,10,Parking was a bit expensive $38/day if you park under the building garage.  If you park for few hours outside it might be cheaper.  It can get slightly noisy if there is any concert going on around the property but we were able to sleep sound.,full-fledged kitchen/wifi/bath/bed condo and clean.
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Richard,United Kingdom,1 review,May 22  2017,9.2,Some minor things: the area is a bit out on a limb. there are restaurants nearby but it's a bit soulless.   I had hoped for harbour views. but you don't really see much water.  I went to the brilliant Italian quarter in Hanover street to eat - that's a 30 minute walk.  I got tired after walking into town on the first day. so I got public transport on subsequent days.    I'm a gym buff and the gym was very basic. but I guess that's typical in hotel and apartment blocks.,The apartment was bright. clean and comfortable.  The kitchen and bathroom were well equipped. it had a great sofa and TV and the bed was huge and super comfortable with lots of pillows.  It was close to the silver line bus stop which has great access to the airport and Downtown.  The concierge was really helpful.  If you book the same day. make sure you call Sarah as soon as you book to organise getting the keys as the booking takes a while to get through to her.
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Neil Swinton,United States of America,3 Reviews,April 12  2017,4.2,Booking.com shows this $200+ property as $87!  "Hotel" is actually apartments being rented on the side. hence no real service.  Window was open on arrival (30F/-1C) -- concierge laughs: "It's cold in Boston in the winter."  We live nearby and we have the sense to close the window in the winter.  Used soap in bathroom.  Garage is $38/night.  Heat/AC in room is a giant pipe that sends a stong draft through the bedroom.  The rental agency wants you to text a photo of your license and credit card before check-in.  You can't reach anyone on the phone at the phone number listed on the booking.com email.  You'll get another. but they don't know Boston to tell you that there is no place called "Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites" -- this is more like a weird Airbnb than an actual hotel.  I disliked this place more than almost anywhere else I've stayed among some hundreds of hotels.,The property is close to Logan Airport but still in Boston.
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Alicia,United States of America,1 review,April 11  2017,10,When we tried to watch Netflix in the evening we couldn't get on because there were too many devices in use.  We registered for a free trial of Netflix in order to watch TV.,Comfortable bed and cozy living space. Nice location just off the water.
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Robert,United Kingdom,1 review,April 7  2017,9.2,Could be a bit easier to find initially (had to ask at another building and get pointed to the location).  Not a criticism by any means.  Nothing else at all to complain about.,The apartment was clean. very comfortable and clearly well looked after in a very nice building (I can imagine that the harborside/seaport area is absolutely buzzing as soon as the summertime approaches).  The building itself is largely residential. so is quiet and secure. Only a 3-4 minute walk to the silver line subway/bus stop and there's a decent deli just outside the building. Really easy to get to from the airport. Lots of bars &amp; restaurants within a five minute walk.
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Douglas,United States of America,1 review,March 23  2017,2.5,Service was extremely poor. Sarah &amp; Robyn both confirmed my arrival time but failed to show up in person so I was locked out. When I reached Sarah. she said she was an hour away. I paid 100% in advance. Sarah  insisted on emailing a photocopy of my credit card from the lobby.   Seriously? That's your guest financial security? I went to another hotel. I'm not waiting around for someone who can't show up so I can email my credit card.  I stayed at the Boston Harbor Hotel. It was great - highly recommended.,N/A

Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Ken Aruba,Aruba,4 Reviews,February 15  2017,10,Stated above,Nice condo in the harbor area of Boston. The check in process was poor.

Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Maurice,United States of America,1 review,January 30  2017,10,Wi-fi rarely worked and no cable. I didn't like having to take a picture of my credit card before arrival but I am comfortable doing it in the future after experiencing the process.,Comfortable bed. excellent location and value. Sarah was awesome making sure everything went well. Not a traditional hotel process but Sarah made it a pleasure. I appreciated the follow up calls just to make sure everything was going well. I will definitely stay here again.
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,John,United States of America,3 Reviews,December 23  2016,8.3,The management firm associated with this property initially advertised a 1073 sq. ft. apartment.  One day into my rental. and upon reflecting on the initial marketing that drew me to this facility. I did a quick rough measurement of the apartment.  It was clear that it was not the size advertised.  I checked with the sales staff in the complex and they confirmed my unit was 706 sq. ft.  Upon my multiple complaints via phone and email. the advertised size dropped to something around 970 sq. ft.  A simple examination of the floor plans for this upscale high-rise apartment  (which are readily available on-line) would clearly show the only apartments in the 900-1070+ range are those apartments with a den.  There was no den in my apartment.  Would I do business with this management firm again. probably not.  Booking.com. perhaps you might want to evaluate a little more thoroughly with whom you do business.,Relatively a great value for the money.
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Shun,France,1 review,October 30  2016,8.0,Several teams of customer service made me confused which phone number I should call for  inquiry and help. Check-in procedure. Due to lack of internal communication. I received the repeated requests of sending copy of ID and bank card from different customer service assistants.,Good location. convenient to go to the downtown. The facilities especially in the kitchen in the room were beyond expectation. Check-out procedure was smooth.Customer service was responsive.
Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Joshua,United States of America,1 review,October 28  2016,8.8,The requirement to fax/email/text a picture of my credit card and driver license is unheard of and shady.

Boston Harbor View Luxury Suites,Bostonneers,Canada,1 review,August 31  2016,8.8,The wi-fi infos were not written in the apartment so we had problems to ask for a second key ( they gave us one key for 4 adults ). Thank god the concierge was helpful and helped us get a wi-fi access to contact the owners. He also had to find out which apartment was for us since Sarah who was supposed to welcome us was not there but everything was fixed very quickly. Also no parking included so USD 35$ a day !,The king bed was very comfortable but the sofa-bed as usual was not as comfortable.The view on the harbor was amazing and we felt very safe.

Boston Yacht Haven,Amanda,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 29  2017,10,N/A,Bed was very comfy. breakfast informal but good selection of food. Snacks &amp; sweets available with coffee in the lounge. Staff very helpful. Good location for sight seeing.
Boston Yacht Haven,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 27  2017,10,There is a free grab and go breakfast. which is very good for what it is. but if you want a full breakfast. you will have to go several blocks.  Also. it would have been nice to have had a full desk in the room. but the table was adequate.,I had a beautifully appointed. spacious room with large decks overlooking the water.  Great sunrise view.  No staff at the front desk outside of business hours. but the staff were very helpful. and there is an onsite property manager who can be called at any time.  Terrific value for the location.
Boston Yacht Haven,Anonymous,Portugal,18 Reviews,October 20  2017,10,There is nothing that could have been improved upon.,Rooms spacious and extremely comfortable.  Bed was massive with beautiful linen. Bathroom facilities lacked nothing.  Always plenty of coffee and milk in the room.  Breakfast delicious with good choice.
Boston Yacht Haven,Anonymous,United States of America,5 Reviews,October 18  2017,10,N/A,The rooms and views were amazing ... and I'm obsessed with the freestanding tub! The staff was friendly and went out  of their way for our entire group!
Boston Yacht Haven,Pnina,Israel,6 Reviews,October 18  2017,9.6,N/A,The location was excellent. you feel in a boat on the ocean but very near to the center of  Boston.The room had excellent decoration. large and comfortable with a great balcony. Couldn't ask for more.The breakfast was not one of the best things to mention at this property. Just boiled eggs. breads. cream cheese very basic.
Boston Yacht Haven,Mary,United States of America,14 Reviews,October 13  2017,10,Nothing,Everything. Simply amazing inn and location. Not just a hotel. an experience. Expensive. yes. but worth it. Wanted to stay forever.  Probably the best. unique property I have stayed st.
Boston Yacht Haven,Darren,United Kingdom,15 Reviews,October 9  2017,9.5,Bathrooms were fine but not quite to the same standard as the room.,Arrived by Water Taxi from the airport. Beautiful location on the waterfront. Large well equipped rooms. Incredibly comfortable bed. Walking distance to most of the sites and attractions. Good breakfast available to take back to your rooms.We loved this hotel. Highly recommended
Boston Yacht Haven,Michele,United States of America,1 review,October 8  2017,8.8,I did not like that they could not accommodate our cars even though the parking lot was basically empty.,Breakfast which included fresh fruit was wonderful.
Boston Yacht Haven,Martin,United Kingdom,11 Reviews,October 4  2017,6.7,The place has slam-shut doors on all rooms and they all slam - a LOT. And when they slam. your room reverberates due to its construction. My wife and I were woken up both nights by people coming in and slamming doors which I've never heard before in 30 years of staying in hotel rooms across the world. Also. our bedroom door was left open one day - all day - by the cleaner (presumably) and we were shocked to find it could be opened by anyone. When we pointed this out to the staff they said "You'll know your room needs a hard pull (which meant they clearly knew there was a problem and hadn't resolved it) We've been here all day so no one could get in" (but that didn't rule out other guests). Also when we pointed out the door noise issue they simply couldn't have cared less. "First we've heard of it ". And there was thick dust in the ledges of the headboard on our bed. For the money they charge. it's not worth it. Stay somewhere else.,Location great. Nice big room. Good view of city. Good welcome and lovely lounge.
Boston Yacht Haven,Janice,United States of America,1 review,October 3  2017,10,The crabby person employed by Commercial Pier who harassed our Uber driver when he dropped us off.,Beds were extremely comfortable and the decor was cozy. but chic.  The breakfast was superb. especially on the day quiche was served.  Pleasant and helpful staff.  And of course. the view was fabulous.  Getting there by water taxi made it all the more fun.
Boston Yacht Haven,Cleo,United States of America,1 review,October 2  2017,10,N/A,The location was perfect.....easy walking distance to everything.  The staff was exceptional. especially Cheryl.  She provided wonderful insights into the city and the "must see" locations and restaurants.  The whole experience was beyond my expectations.
Boston Yacht Haven,Harald,Ireland,1 review,September 28  2017,10,N/A,The bed was indeed extra comfortable. the view was spectacular and the welcoming warm and super friendly. My number one choice the next time I'm in town again.
Boston Yacht Haven,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 25  2017,9.2,Realize this is actually part of a condominium. therefore parking is at a very high premium. Though parking "may" be available. don't plan on it. Plan on walking 2-3 blocks to closest public lots after unloading..,location-location-location! On the Harbor. Staff. especially Rick.
Boston Yacht Haven,Richard,United Kingdom,9 Reviews,August 29  2017,9.6,A little bit pricey but was fair compared to other hotels in August,Great location in the heart of Boston and a hidden gem. Visited in August with my wife and three kids for a night and went to see the Redsox play as well. Had a great run along the harbour walk that is accessible from the front door. Lots of places to eat nearby. Would stay again
Boston Yacht Haven,Stephen,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,August 23  2017,10,having to leave.,Location. location. location. Lovely setting among the yachts. the room was excellent and met our needs perfectly. Excellent as a base for exploring the city. High standard of dÃ©cor. Great facilities- my daughters made use of the gym and we all used the lounge with its coffee-making facilities and the pool table. Breakfasts just right at convenient times.
Boston Yacht Haven,Jean,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 2  2017,8.3,Very rude staff upon our departure.  Would not accommodate us to park in lot even though we counted over 10 available spots in the lot.,Beautiful location!
Boston Yacht Haven,Mrs Mo,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,July 31  2017,10,N/A,A brilliant location right on the harbour. beside the ports and near to the Italian 'North end'. The hotel is definitely unique and more expensive than I had planned to spend. but felt a real wee treat. The room was big enough for us and our 3 teens. Although we didn't use them. I know I would have been happy to have a microwave and fridge in the room when our boys were younger. A beautiful view from our window watching the boats- great to bring the lovely buffet breakfast to our table in the room in the morning. Breakfast was perfect for us- cereals. fresh fruit and pastries. Treat yourself to a couple of nights!
Boston Yacht Haven,Kaye,Australia,14 Reviews,July 14  2017,9.6,Nothing,The room was very large with a view over the harbour. Breakfast was plentiful. Staff were friendly and helpful and made our stay very enjoyable. Central location. A wonderful place to stay.
Boston Yacht Haven,Vladimir,Israel,10 Reviews,July 12  2017,9.6,I am not sure that the size and photo of the room was taken from the room we got- it is not 60 sq.m. but may be around 45-50. large. but i prefer more acqurate presentation.And impossible to open the window for taking pictures of the gulf,Comfort and location
Boston Yacht Haven,Shawn,United States of America,1 review,June 21  2017,10,Our room had lots of natural light. but no overhead lights...so when the sun went down. it could've definitely been brighter...the lamps just didn't cut it.  Also. the location is amazing right on the harbor....but unfortunately some huge docked yachts blocked a lot of the view of the harbor :-(,The location. staff. views. breakfast. captain's room were all exceptional!  It was pricey but it met all our expectations!  They even provided room snacks/waters free of charge as well as complimentary beverages in the lounge.
Boston Yacht Haven,Gillian,United Kingdom,1 review,June 17  2017,7.5,Wifi was pretty slow and difficult to use during our stayDidn't see why we we're not able to park on site. seemed a lot of vacant spaces outside ?,Views we're excellent
Boston Yacht Haven,Robert,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,June 9  2017,9.2,Small but really important point was the bathroom decor and fitments. For $400 a night with Tax we would expect a higher end fit in the bathroom that to be honest was well below what it should have been.,Location was outstanding with stunning views of the sea as the city high line which is spectacular.  The site at the end of a small marina outlet was very quiet.  The room was similar to a colonial style with beams and furniture that was high quality.  The bed was massive and most comfortable we have ever slept in. Staff joyous and room facilities such as a multi coffee maker machine on tap outstanding. Breakfast were lovely too.
Boston Yacht Haven,Rodney,New Zealand,19 Reviews,May 28  2017,8.3,Taxi ride from the airport was extremely slow and has been like it for many years.Breakfast poor. If food was run out it wasnt replenished. When I asked housekeeping they said sorry we are run out. Guests were filling paper bags with the cakes and pastries to take out and with no replenishment then no food left for other guests. Very pricey considering the above. You may have paid for breakfast biut may not get any as we found out our first day.,Room was great. Plenty of room.
Boston Yacht Haven,Laurel,United States of America,7 Reviews,May 20  2017,10,Gluten free members of our party did not have much choice at the continental breakfast.,Stunning property down to the tiniest details. Our room was spacious and beautifully furnished. comfy bed. great linens. views of harbor. Couch and chair as well as table and four chairs so we weren't sitting on bed whole time. Also enjoyed the lounge area on first floor w excellent views of water. All staff exceptionally friendly who made extra effort to help w advice. directions and any requests. Also. with only 10 rooms. it was a very quiet place.
Boston Yacht Haven,Gregory,United States of America,1 review,May 17  2017,9.6,Not a thing,Reception staff was beyond great. I put my 88 year old mother up for the night so she could catch her flight next day. I forget the name of the man who greeted us but he was so helpful to my mother and just went so far beyond kind and helpful there just not enough adjectives to describe. Mom says she felt like a princess
Boston Yacht Haven,Anonymous,Czech Republic,34 Reviews,May 10  2017,8.8,no service at the front desk after 6 pm. pricy parking. no no elevator up in the room (just 1 floor lower). small bathroom,nice place with amazing view. cosy spacious bedroom. comfortable bed
Boston Yacht Haven,Oskar,Canada,2 Reviews,May 6  2017,9.6,The lack of quiche for breakfast for day 2 and day 3 ;),Excellent staff and prompt e-mail communication. I got stranded on the way up and they were extra accommodating. I liked the quiche for breakfast on the first day.
Boston Yacht Haven,Michelle,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 30  2017,10,N/A,Very convenient to everything we like to do in Boston. but very private and peaceful at the same time. The staff were so friendly and helpful. The room was amazing! Our balcony overlooking the harbor was huge!! Out of all our stays in Boston this one was by far the best!!!
Boston Yacht Haven,Angela,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 14  2017,10,N/A,We enjoyed our stay a great deal.  Often hard to find accommodations for a family if 5.  Great location. close to many attractions by walking (Fanuel Hall/North End/ TD Garden) our room was spacious with a great view.  The downstairs shared space was wonderful. Our teen boys enjoyed playing pool. Would definitely return.
Boston Yacht Haven,Patricia,United States of America,1 review,April 5  2017,8.3,Room was smaller than expected. Needed more wall outlets.,Bed was very comfortable. Balcony was nice. Very quiet property. Great restaurants nearby. Very walkable part of Boston. Early check in was very much appreciated.
Boston Yacht Haven,Ulrich,Germany,19 Reviews,March 29  2017,9.6,Nothing.,Ultimate privacy right at Boston waterfront. A full continental breakfast with great croissants and cerials is served for self-service in-room or balcony dining. Weather allowing. you can have a private breakfast right in front of the great boston skyline. There is also free all-day supply of coffee and tea. Staff was extremely helpful and friendly.
Boston Yacht Haven,Sarah,United Kingdom,1 review,March 27  2017,10,N/A,Excellent staff. very kind and friendly We arrived very late but this was made very easy for us and instructions were excellent Lovely breakfast. stunning room with very comfy bed and great location. it really is a hidden gem.

Boston Yacht Haven,Juli,United States of America,2 Reviews,March 13  2017,10,N/A,The staff was extremely helpful and knowledgable with all of our questions regarding the area.  Our room was beatiful and we will definitely be returning.
Boston Yacht Haven,Jonathan,United States of America,9 Reviews,February 3  2017,10,N/A,The staff went all out for our grandsons and made our stay memorable. The room was spacious and nicely decorated with a nautical theme. Location was great.
Boston Yacht Haven,Jon,United States of America,1 review,January 25  2017,4.6,This place is under renovation. We were not informed upon booking! The gym was closed. half the floor was closed off. We arrived at approx. 7.30pm and the place was closed. They left our room key in a lockbox to retrieve. People were parking out the front of the hotel and it seemed ok for them but we were told no and had to park the car elsewhere and pay $58 extra. The room cost $645 for 2 nights and was to include breakfast. However. on coming down for breakfast on our first morning we found only a few bagels/pastries. only 2% milk. some cereal boxes and a coffee machine. Really nothing available at all even though no other guest had been down. Yes. this is better than nothing at all but for the price we paid to stay at this place. we expected better. Our room was quite dark and we called reception to ask if the ceiling blinds could be opened. No one answered so we left a message. No one phoned back. So we went down to reception where the lady told us she didn't get a message (even though we could see her message light was blinking).... she phoned maintenance who advised that he didn't want to open the blind incase the screen fell out!! This was a family trip and we wanted a special weekend. We expected so much more considering the money we paid.,The location was good. Thats about it.
Boston Yacht Haven,Marian,United States of America,6 Reviews,December 30  2016,10,Some parts of the main shared area smelled a bit strong of Lysol (I'm sensitive) but it was very clean and a wonderful place to look out at the waterfront.  Would love to come back in warmer weather when it's more comfortable to walk the town.,The location was wonderful -right on the waterfront.  A beautiful room!  Very nice that the water taxi comes right to the door from the airport - can't beat that!  The staff is fantastic and very helpful with suggestions for restaurants. etc.
Boston Yacht Haven,Kristin,United States of America,2 Reviews,December 16  2016,10,It did not have on site parking which was no big deal otherwise perfect!,Loved the location. beautiful view. extremely comfortable large room with comfy beds.
Boston Yacht Haven,Abigail,United States of America,7 Reviews,December 13  2016,10,Nothing! I couldn't afford to stay there in the summer. but it will be my off-season go-to place in Boston.,Boston Yacht Haven was the perfect place for a short getaway. The location could not have been better for exploring the North End and Quincy Market for the holiday lights. And although the location is very central. it's super quiet. right out on the water.
Boston Yacht Haven,Hillz..,Italy,31 Reviews,December 7  2016,10,No parking outside the hotel even during low season even if there is plenty of space. Need to park in a nearby parking lot. Daily rates are reasonable though. Don't let this stop you from choosing Boston Yacht Haven!!!,Excellent and quiet location. Within walking distance from restaurants and Quincy Market. Giant and extra comfortable room.
Boston Yacht Haven,Dale,Canada,2 Reviews,November 26  2016,9.6,No negatives.,Loved the spacious room. perfect location. friendly and helpful staff. delicious breakfast service on our floor so we could take breakfast back to our room. and the view of Boston harbor.  We only had small carry-on luggage so we were able to take the subway from Logan to the aquarium stop and walk to this hotel.  Saving on cab fare to and from the airport kept up on budget.
Boston Yacht Haven,Barbara,United States of America,3 Reviews,November 20  2016,10,Bed could was a little firm for me. Towels could be replaced soon,Spacious room. great location and views. Terrific pillows and linens. Loved taking the water taxi straight from Logan. Loved having fridge. microwave and Keurig.
Boston Yacht Haven,Brycey,United Kingdom,12 Reviews,November 18  2016,7.5,Check in is between 3 and 5pm (rediculous 2 hour window) which we were not informed about. We then had to spend 45 minutes on an international phone call to booking.com to gain access to building. Was not happy. Didn't seem to be any staff working in the evening which isn't safe (or helpful) and surely isn't legal. Though it was great once access was gained. I struggle to call this place a hotel. Felt more like someone had told me to go back to their place after a few too many drinks and they failed to give me a key. Disappointing as if it was run more like a conventional hotel it could be outstanding.,Amazing views.Bed was most comfitable I've ever had in a hotel. Dealt with issues we had with our stay reasonably well.
Boston Yacht Haven,Patricia,United Kingdom,51 Reviews,October 29  2016,10,Breakfast had to be eaten in bedroom . This was ok if you had a terrace . but not otherwise .,The position was spectacular . overlooking Boston harbour . It was lovely sitting on our terrace in the evening .
Boston Yacht Haven,Christine,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 27  2016,10,N/A,We loved this place. a hidden gem in the city of Boston. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Our room was quaint and so comfortable. There was even a bottle of wine waiting for us as we were celebrating our 30th anniversary.
Boston Yacht Haven,Sue,New Zealand,2 Reviews,October 23  2016,10,Nothing,Lovely having warm croissants/bagels/muffins/scones for breakfast. Loved that you could get a water taxi from Logan airport straight to BYH jetty.
Boston Yacht Haven,Jackie Beckmann,United States of America,1 review,October 16  2016,7.5,Staff kinda had an attitude.   We're not real friendly.   Pricey,Location was great.   Loved  balcony that over looked the water.  Also loves how large the room was.   Very clean too.  Microwave and refrigerator in room also also coffee and tea.
Boston Yacht Haven,Wrandy21,United Kingdom,12 Reviews,October 3  2016,8.3,The facility needs to improve the rapport with the landlords security company. We were being collected by a private company with small mini van and had great difficulty in convincing the guard to allow them access so I could collect my luggage (having walked to the entrance to arrange)  In the end the guard was out numbered by the driver. co-driver and myself. and capitulated. But it left me agrivated for an hour or so unnecessarily.,The location of the accommodation is outstanding. Surrounded on 3 side by water - fab.The breakfast. initially I thought to be odd. but having got to grips with the procedure. it too was fine. Although perhaps bread in addition to bagels would have been nice.
Boston Yacht Haven,Valdis,United States of America,36 Reviews,September 26  2016,9.2,Loved it all.,Spoils you for all other hotels.  perfect location . directly on the water. near Quincy Market. surrounded by good restaurants.  More like staying a wealthy friend's home than a hotel.  Pool table in "relaxation room" a fun extra.
Boston Yacht Haven,Brenda,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 22  2016,10,Nothing!!,The deck and view of Biston Harbor is exceptional. The room is huge with large windows all around.walking distance to so many of Biston's special places
Boston Yacht Haven,Peter,United Kingdom,28 Reviews,September 17  2016,10,N/A,Fantastic location. view of the harbour &amp; airport to rear &amp; Boston skyline from front. Great restaurant nearby for food plus good selection of beers. Quincy market 2 blocks away. My daughter had the penthouse with panoramic views plus 3 balconies. I use a wheelchair so could not access top floor. the wife and I had to make do with just a superb room with one balcony. The only down side - we stayed just one night. could have stayed all week. All the staff were very helpful. nothing too much for them.   Would highly recommend.
Boston Yacht Haven,Rachelle,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 26  2016,10,N/A,Amazing inn right where you want to be for Boston leisure activities. Room was spacious. clean and comfy. View of harbor and city lights at night was beautiful. Will absolutely stay here again.
Boston Yacht Haven,Amy,United States of America,1 review,August 17  2016,9.6,N/A,Great location. great view. private.  Unlike any place we have ever stayed.  Loved everything about this place!  Will definitely recommend it to anyone staying in Boston!
Boston Yacht Haven,Jeremy,United States of America,1 review,August 12  2016,10,That i didnt stay two nights. ğŸ˜Š,The owners were Amazing and very helpful. This is a rare jewel of a bed and breakfast tucked away in the middle of north end Boston. The view was incredible. My daughter loved all the boats. The room had every one could need.
Boston Yacht Haven,Jan,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,August 3  2016,10,No food or drink allowed on deck outside Captain's lounge so no evening outdoor glass of wine/beer for those rooms without a balcony. Not really a problem for us. as only there two nights. but would have been if there for a week! Breakfast options quite limited. but again not really a problem unless you were staying for a longer period.,Excellent location on the waterfront. close to many bars. restaurants and shops. Very friendly and helpful staff. especially Rick. who couldn't have done more for us.
Boston Yacht Haven,Magdalena,Indonesia,23 Reviews,July 29  2016,8.3,nothing,Exclusive location.  quiet/restful. high security and convenient. with beautiful view of the ocean from the bedroom. surrounded by luxurious yacht; only tenths meters away from the quiet place will find resto. clubs. pubs. entertainment spots. even shop malls.
Boston Yacht Haven,Tabu,United States of America,9 Reviews,July 19  2016,9.2,N/A,View from the balcony. The feel of a small. quaint property in downtown! Able to take water taxi around to other points on the harbor. We never needed a cab or a car. We took the Salem. MA ferry into Boston &amp; the yacht haven is a short walk from the ferry landing. Also. watching the yachts come &amp; go was fun!
Boston Yacht Haven,Meg,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,July 19  2016,9.6,N/A,Huge family room. We loved looking out onto the harbour and its activity. The self service breakfast and being able to eat in our room suited us well. Great location and easy walking distant to the great restaurants of little Italy and all the sights. Very hot while we were here so made use of the trolley tours and appreciated the hotel's air con after sight seeing! Children enjoyed playing pool in the Captains lounge. Very friendly and helpful staff.
Boston Yacht Haven,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 17  2016,8.8,Broken elevator made it inconvenient with heavy baggage. Very limited staff hours.,Fantastic location. friendly staff. No full time desk help. Broken elevator. All in all. nice property in a perfect harbor setting.
Boston Yacht Haven,Jonas,Norway,22 Reviews,July 17  2016,8.8,The breakfast is not too impressive as there are only cornflakes. croissants and fruit to choose from.,Fantastic location and beautiful view / scenery from the room.
Boston Yacht Haven,Sunil,United States of America,1 review,July 17  2016,10,The breakfast was actually good. But the service could start a bit earlier to something like 6:30 instead of 7:15 am ish.,My private and large balcony with a view of the water and boats was just simply the best.
Boston Yacht Haven,Rhian,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,July 16  2016,7.9,Our arrival was very anonymous as the desk is only manned until 5pm. We arrived with 2weeks' worth of luggage to find a broken lift and saw no-one at all in the building. One member of staff the following day was very helpful . another extremely offhand. One night here cost over half what we paid for 3 nights in a 5star hotel in the same city 2 weeks later (July 4th weekend),Location overlooking the harbour is fantastic and I could have spent all day watching all the boating activity. Our room was huge and beautifully appointed.
Boston Yacht Haven,Robin,United States of America,1 review,June 27  2016,10,N/A,The room was absolutely gorgeous. free breakfast in morning. coffee maker in room. comfy couches. beautiful view of Boston harbour. right next door to the North End and all the great italian restaurants. I can't think of one negative thing to say
Boston Yacht Haven,Wendy,United States of America,1 review,June 20  2016,9.2,This is being very picky because our stay was next to perfect but one set of blinds out of many did not work and a lamp shade was bent. Very minor in the grand scheme of things because the place is wonderful!,The large deck and huge windows made the view AMAZING! Lots of space.....and if you watch TV. it was the best I've ever had in a hotel stay. The next time I visit Boston I will definitely stay here again! PERFECT location and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful!
Boston Yacht Haven,Malcolm,Malta,8 Reviews,June 19  2016,10,N/A,This place was more than perfect... We were close to everything and yet in a secluded quiet place on the wharf.  We couldn't have enjoyed it more. Absolutely fabulous.
Boston Yacht Haven,Mike,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 31  2016,10,I only wish we could have stayed even longer to enjoy the downstairs amenities more!,Location was perfect as well as the views. The staff was extremely welcoming each day. Rooms were beautiful. spacious and immaculate.
Boston Yacht Haven,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,May 10  2016,9.2,N/A,Quiet. small bed and breakfast that allows for a break from the hustle and bustle of the city while still being right in the middle of the city!  Feels like you are on a boat in Boston harbor.
Boston Yacht Haven,Genevieve,United States of America,1 review,May 1  2016,8.8,N/A,The location. overlooking the bay and a couple blocks from Faneuil Hall. was perfect. Even if your room doesn't overlook the bay. the comfortable guest lounge does.
Boston Yacht Haven,Ivar,United States of America,12 Reviews,April 29  2016,7.5,Pricing of rooms. Their web site quoted $100 per night less. When called on it "the web site has not been updated. and there are different rooms.",N/A
Boston Yacht Haven,Jim,United States of America,1 review,April 26  2016,10,Wish it had a bar. But I wouldn't have been there anyway because I would be on the deck with my own bottle of wine.,Location was amazing. As a Bostonian it felt like a true retreat!
Boston Yacht Haven,Catherine,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,April 26  2016,10,N/A,This place is an absolute gem. a fantastic location with stunning views. The rooms are enormous and extremely comfortable with large beds. crisp linen. spotlessly clean and the dining table and chairs is a bonus too. The complimentary breakfast was perfect  simple fresh fare of fruit. cereals. yoghurts. bagels. croissants. soda bread and muffins. juice - all laid up just outside your room so you can go back and forth. great when you have a growing boy. Staff are lovely. couldn't be more helpful and we made great use of the lounge downstairs. playing pool every day. lots of complimentary tea and coffee available. You don't need a bar/restaurant on site as you are so close to many restaurants. Quincy market and the fantastic Italian Quarter. The tranquility of being by the water makes it hard to believe you are in the city. Water taxi ride over from the airport is a great way to arrive. the subway station is close by to go further afield and there is lots to do a stones throw away. The harbour side walk is beautiful. we had just the best stay here and would definitely recommend. we will return!
Boston Yacht Haven,Juliana,Brazil,3 Reviews,April 23  2016,10,Honestly? It was all perfect!,Great location and an amazing view! We got the penthouse and it was incredible - views from the city. the wharf and the harbor! Also. super comfy bed. good breakfast and really kind staff. Will stay there again for sure!!!!
Boston Yacht Haven,Anonymous,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,April 15  2016,9.2,Our bathroom was a bit odd. and given the huge size of the room. the tiny loo/bathroom with mini bath/shower over was a disappointment.  There were 2 sinks in a separate area. without a door but behind a wall. Overall a bit odd. and could be significantly improved given the amount of space available.No kettle.  Coffee machine made reasonable coffee but water not hot enough for tea!,Fantastic location on the water front. but still only a short walk to Freedom Trail and central parts of city.  The Yacht Haven has 10 "luxury" B&amp;B rooms.  The rooms we had were very spacious. with a comfy super-king bed in ours. and 2 doubles in the kids' room.  Rooms had large seating areas. table &amp; chairs. big TVs and coffee machines.  Our room also had a vast balcony with amazing view over the harbour.Very nice continental breakfast included. laid out by the bedrooms. so you could take what you wanted into your room.

My phone didn't pick up the email in time so i couldn't get in. The staff were really rude when I complained about this then slashed me off behind my back as I left. And the WiFi didn't work.,N/A
Boston Yacht Haven,Andrew,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,April 7  2016,9.2,The room temperature was hard to control as it was sometimes too hope then it was too cold and if you slept in or were last to breakfast you may have been disappointed so best to go early for breakfast,The Boston Yacht Haven hotel is in a fantastic location in downtown Boston. The room that we had was very spacious and had all the facilities that we needed for a short stay. The staff were really friendly and the room was spotlessly clean.

Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,7 Reviews,October 31  2017,4.6,shower was clogged and needed to call maintenance.  Called Friday during business hours with no return call.  Called the next day first thing along with an email expressing our dissatisfaction.  The shower was fixed when we returned but one really needs to question how the shower could have been called clean when you only have 30 seconds before you are in an inch of water.  Bathroom was dirty.  Rained the last night and the noise from water hitting the AC unit made the room unsleepable.  Carpet is old and dirty.  Room is beyond small,location
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Carol,United Kingdom,15 Reviews,October 31  2017,9.2,I think that it might be quite noisy if more of the units were occupied as the walls seemed thin.,Door codes were sent via email which makes it easier checking in &amp; out.The bed was really comfortable.Nice area and very convenient to a few different subway stops &amp; lines. Easy to get into the city.Plenty of restaurants nearby.
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Luciana,United States of America,1 review,October 30  2017,8.0,Building inspection hanging on the wall said permit expired in 2016. Truly hope this was just an oversight from someone.,The apartment was very clean and linens were comfortable. Very quiet neighborhood was a plus. Six flights of stairs was fought to face every day.
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Wayne Loxton,United Kingdom,20 Reviews,October 29  2017,3.3,I would like to report how disappointed we were with our recent stay.  Whilst  the location was great. the advert on line does not represent how small the room is and how poorly finished it is.  It is not a Deluxe studio and our room was not representative of any of the Photos on line. However. our greatest problem is the email we received with a few days to go with check in instructions and only at this stage were we informed of the limited parking – even though the advert does not say its limited – and which we were unable to get for the night of our arrival!  Even if it is available it is an extra $30 per night.   We then booked for the following night as we panicked a little. but we did not receive any confirmation so we made alternative arrangements for both evenings - much cheaper around the corner at $20 per night.  We contacted the parking site to ask for a refund.  They said they would look into it but never replied.  Were still waiting.,Location
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 25  2017,8.3,No elevator . it was tough getting our luggage up to the front door and  flights of steep stairs.

Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Martyn,Ireland,1 review,October 23  2017,7.1,The accommodation looked much bigger on the pictures.

Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Xavier,United States of America,1 review,October 17  2017,8.8,Parking is a little tight. But lucky to even have the option in this area.,Location is awesome and walkable. Vintage look. A tad overpriced but came in clutch when no hotel options had vacancy.
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 16  2017,9.6,Boston has SO MANY steps! The brownstone architecture has entry doors that are 12-13 steps up. and there are only 2 or 3 apartments on each floor. so there are 4-5 floors. meaning more steps!The kitchen is tiny - the sink is barely large enough to set a plate in the bottom of it to wash. The faucet could reach out further. but it was manageable.,This property is located in a quiet neighborhood. with restaurants. corner grocers. laundromat. and other shops surrounding it. making it so much fun to just walk wherever we needed to go. It is just four blocks from the T metro. and three blocks from the Route 1 bus that goes to MIT. Harvard. Trader Joe's. etc. And STRBoston has a couple other locations even more convenient than this.
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anita,United States of America,1 review,October 13  2017,7.5,Room was extremely small (studio) with no luggage rack (I did not want to unpack and put everything in dresser for 3 days.),Location. quiet neighborhood with plenty of options for eating.

Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Peter,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 10  2017,6.3,We are 4 senior citizens &amp; when we originally booked we specifically requested that we were given rooms on the lower floors. You can understand our disappointment when we arrived to find that we had been allocated a room on the top floor &amp; one on the floor directly underneath with no elevator facility. Had we known that this was the case we probably would have cancelled the booking. We tried to contact the office only to find that it was closed.The rooms were clean but "tired" &amp; in need of some TLC &amp; renewal of beds.,The location of the property is excellent.
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Amanda,United Kingdom,1 review,October 9  2017,7.9,shame there’s no lift or help to carry heavy cases up/down stairs!,Great room and location. Nice and quiet inside building and quiet street. Felt very safe in building and in the area.
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Pei,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 7  2017,8.3,Only complaint was that instructions for how to get there could be clearer--Google Maps leads you to the alley. when the front door is actually a much better way to get in.,Clean. and really well priced. I was in Boston during a big conference. and hotels were $400. 600. even $1000. Thank goodness I found this place. I enjoyed this part of Boston. Stumbled across Frenchie and had an evening of wine and conversation with the locals--such fun.
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Marmie,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,October 1  2017,7.9,Very noisy air conditioning unit made it hard to have on at night so it got too hot. Also. fridge is quite noisy too.,Great shower and Comfy bed. Close to subways and food outlets and a great jazz bar.

Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Rodrigo,Spain,2 Reviews,September 29  2017,7.1,Some parts of the property were a bit shabby. for instance the carpets in the staircase. or the shower in my bathroom. Something annoying in my studio was that I found no way to open the windows: either they were disabled or just too hard to pull up. So I had to resort to the A/C. something really not necessary given the time of the year. Finally. one last thing: it was virtually impossible to obtain a proper invoice from the owner. STR Boston. despite several emails.,This is an unstaffed building. so you receive an email with the code to enter the building and your room 48h in advance. That worked smoothly. and even arriving two hours before check-in time it was no problem to access the room. The location is also very good. The studio was compact. but that was expected.
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Marc,United States of America,1 review,September 29  2017,6.5,Room is cramped. It was near impossible to work at the mini desk in the room. Could use some updates. carpet. painting etc.,Great neighborhood. Lots of food options nearby.
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Kevin,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,September 17  2017,6.3,The room was very small. There was nowhere secure to leave our bags on the last day and one of our bags was opened/searched through. Given the price paid I expected a better service.,Well located
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,September 15  2017,6.7,Short Tetm rentals were not easy to communicate.  We only booked this the day before we were due to arrive.  We arrived at property at 17:15 with no details on how to access the property other than an email which states we should receive email 48 hrs before hand with access details.  I phoned the number both on the email and in the front of the building but got answer machine. left messages and sent text.  No one bothered to contact me back.  I got and email at 17:45 with access details.  Had to sit on doorstep for 30 mins not knowing how I was going to get access - not great service after just driving 8.5 hours!!!,Great location
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,4 Reviews,September 14  2017,5.8,Very sparse room. Generally clean but rough around the edges. Air condition unit in the window made a lot of noise.,Check in was easy with door codes. Good location.
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Eddie,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 7  2017,6.7,The 5 floor walk-up with luggage was a PITA. The water pressure was atrocious. The window was off the hinge and literally fell into my room barely avoiding injuring me.,Building outside and the street was beautiful.
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Heidi,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 6  2017,2.9,The whole experience. 3 of 4 attempts to communicate with the business through Booking.com per the website. were unanswered. They charged me the full price 2 full months in advance. And had an unreasonable and strict 30 day cancel policy. I paid an extra $30 to self park behind building compared to $40 for valet at a 4 star hotel. There was no attendant on duty at building. I was emailed instructions and codes for locks. There were 4 flrs no elevator so I requested 1st floor as I had a lot of luggage. I was told they could not guarantee room assignments prior to arrival and after arriving on redeye flight. there was not a secure place to leave bags. I understand this was not a hotel but I paid hotel prices for a room that came with no services or amenities. I agreed to all their limitations because location was very good for my needs and I hoped my doubts would be relieved when I got there. The facility was in such poor condition I checked out 6 hrs after I checked in. The website misrepresented the room and the building. both of which were filthy and in disrepair. The room was unprofessionally appointed. for example there was a dresser sticking out past its wall 12". blocking entry into the room. The carpets were stained and tattered. the walls and light switches were dirty. The trim along the floor was sticking out and falling off. The grout on the shower floor was black with mold when it should have been lighter original color. The blinds had a layer of dust. The hangers in the closet were random dry cleaner hangers. The furniture was unmatched. scratched and of poor quality. The toilet was not secure and wobbled when you sat on it. The hallway carpets of the building were stained and dirty. the window frames were visibly dusty dirty. screens had bent frames. There was a random screw was sticking out of the inside of the front door. The whole place gave me the creeps. All aspects of my experience were substandard and absolutely a rip off for what I paid.,The housekeeper was polite. The location was okay. Other than that nothing.

Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Ian,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,September 2  2017,3.3,Very small room.  No oven to cook with. Room door lock was basic.   Didn't feel secure.Very basic facilities. Small table provided with one chair. so the only option for my wife and I was to eat sitting on the bed.  TV provided also had limited choice of channels and was not high definition.Price is double that of most hotels but room was smaller than expected and with very limited facilities.Not recommended.,Only the location
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Shaun,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,August 29  2017,3.3,Everything about the room was awful. It was very small. dimly lit. stains on the floor. no breakfast. no view as mentioned. a brick wall. As above the photos and description was not only inaccurate but simply a lie. The room with a view was literally a brick wall. Basically a lot of money for a small unkempt room is what we got.,The location only. Everything else in the ad simply was not honest and it made our trip to Boston unpleasant as we dreaded going back to the apartment. The room had no redeeming qualities at all.
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 29  2017,8.3,The parking had to be paid for separately and was horrible. could barely squeeze my midsize car into the spot #4 that I was assigned.  If you have a large vehicle. you do not want to park in spot #4. Spots 1-3 all looked like they had more room to maneuver but it is a tight ally and small area to park.  Fortunately I didn't have to drive much.,Awesome location walking or bicycling distance to just about everything in downtown Boston.  Guests are required to do some house keeping - dump trash. clean dishes and silverware.  But for the price and location it was worth it. very nice area.
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Randall,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 26  2017,8.8,Never did figure out how to operate TV so we could watch regular stations and the news.

Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Douglas,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 18  2017,7.5,The "apartment" wasn't even a studio.  It was one room. barely big enough for the queen bed.  There was a "kitchen" with no oven. no dishwasher == just a sink and a tiny fridge.  The bathroom was eensy weensy and the shower was a phone booth.  It had been updated. but the toilet was poorly installed.  The lid kept getting caught under the counter. and the connections to the floor were.....gross.  There was only one. uncomfortable chair. so I ended up working on the bed. like a college student.  The chair really didn't fit in the room either. as it had to be placed in front of the door to the tiny closet.,The location was absolutely perfect.  I also liked the guidebook to the neighborhood the host provided.
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Amanda,United States of America,1 review,August 17  2017,8.5,Just be aware this is more like an air B&amp;B than hotel.

Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Harald,United States of America,5 Reviews,August 14  2017,5.4,We didn't know how to get in!!  We knew it was by code ... but had ( erroneously ) assumed that the booking.com PIN was it and that everything else would be resolved once inside ( in particular our question regarding parking. to which we never had received a reply ).  But no. the code didn't work.  There was an emergency number next to the door. which I called.  I was told to look for an email in my spam folder ( seriously?  Wade through 1000+ Emails?).  I got it narrowed down by sender and date ( two days before ). so I started searching.  The person also told me he'd be there in 5 min.. I managed to find that lost email after a few minutes. which a code and instructions of how to get to the property ( duh ... a bit late!!).  Regarding parking. it told me to call that number again ... no answer. I kept trying multiple times for half an hour.  Eventually. I rechecked the original booking.com info: it said sth about calling that number and gave an option to request parking. at a cost.  So I did that too.  After some more emails. waiting. etc.. we eventually got a parking spot behind the house... anyways. the whole arrival was an ordeal.  The room is small.  The fridge and airco very noisy.  Coffee machine was broken.  No spoons.  So: not a well-maintained kitchen corner. let's say.,Very convenient for our purpose. visiting our daughter nearby.  Room was clean.  It also was the cheapest or one of the cheapest option for staying in that general area for three days.

Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Michelle,United States of America,4 Reviews,August 7  2017,8.8,Size of room was too small. as I was originally traveling with my youngest child. it would never have worked out. he's 5'10". and I was under the impression there was to be a sitting area. separate from the bed area. I would call next time to clarify details. as I am inclined to also want a way to open windows or sit outside. which I was pretty sure there was. but wasn't!,Location by far and cleanliness were excellent. Parking for an additional fee was nice to have.  They have many options. and the area is wonderful. you are close to everything. I did utilize some car services for farther out journeys.

Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Sonja,United States of America,1 review,August 1  2017,3.8,(1) The room was small and cramped -- especially for two people.

(4) We weren't told about the peculiarities of the property until it was past the deadline to cancel. (5) There was barely enough tissue provided.,The location in comparison to where we were visiting was the best thing. Easy walking distance to the places we were visiting. The neighborhood had several options for dining. I was even able to get a haircut around the corner from the rental.

Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Caroline,Ireland,3 Reviews,July 1  2017,7.9,Some of the skirting around the edges of the room has slipped and room slightly smaller than those in pictures.,Great location 10 minutes walk to Prudential. good communication and plenty of helpful tips provided. Easy. convenient access to building. Good supply of basic facilities such as towels. air con and kitchen supplies. Early check in allowed also.
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Marissa,Australia,1 review,June 23  2017,5.4,Unfortunately. for two people staying here. you could not even put your suitcases anywhere. I obviously didn't look at the photos clearly enough as it really was just a room with ensuite. The air conditioner was placed in the window facing on to your face and the noise was like a lawn mower been turned on &amp; off. I would recommend only if you could sleep anyway with minimal luggage.,N/A
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Dennis,United States of America,1 review,June 22  2017,5.0,The room was much smaller than promoted - hardly room to walk around the bed. The parking spot (for an extra $30 a day) was impossible to get out of when someone was in spots on both sides - be careful.I made a mistake in booking our two nights (I forgot about losing a day traveling from Hawaii) - the office staff was so RUDE in dealing with it. They had the cleaning person dump all of our belongings in the hall - laptop. Ipads. everything left out in the open - anything could have been taken. They also charged an extra $110 fee. We will never use this company again and warn anyone who stays with them - their customer service is awful - no one should be so disrespected.,The old brick neighborhood is beautiful.
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Diana,Ireland,8 Reviews,June 15  2017,5.0,THE STAIRS!!!!!  My room was on the 5th floor up a fairly narrow and steep staircase and there was NO LIFT/ELEVATOR and no indication on the website that this was the case.  The building is an old traditional brownstone but that's no reason why as a visitor to Boston I might have known or guessed!  I had booked 3 nights but checked out after the second when my husband joined me at another hotel after a lengthy transatlantic flight to avoid the need for him to drag another large suitcase up the stairs for such a short stay.,Location.  The king size bed was OK (but almost as large as the room!)
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Tracy,United States of America,1 review,June 12  2017,6.7,Pretty small for the price.  Also. for what we paid I would think the parking spot would have been included but we had to pay additional per night rate for that as well.,Great location.  Though small. we had everything we needed.  There's so much to do in a town like Boston that you really only need a bed and a shower and you're good to go.  Comfortable and clean.
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Global,United Arab Emirates,6 Reviews,June 10  2017,3.8,No staff on site. No phone no available to contact the owners. No provision fr daily sheet/towel change although charges much higher than a 3-4 star hotel!! Crappy sized shower stall. Shaggy decadent carpet. Grilles coming off ventilator shafts. NO security bolts or systems fr the room' windows which is easily accessible from the street!! No more short term rentals fr me. For that price. I can get a decent hotel with staff!,Location
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Carol,Ireland,7 Reviews,June 7  2017,9.2,Kitchenette very small (didn't bother us as we weren't cooking). Whatever way the aircon unit is fixed to the window. when it rained the rain sounded super loud and in the room.,Very clean. well maintained. Lovely looking building. Perfect size for a couple doing lots of sightseeing. Nice little table for takeaways. Good location for walking. good eateries nearby. Baggage storage before check-in. after check-out.
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Kevin,United States of America,1 review,May 24  2017,4.2,The description of this property was a complete fabrication.  It was described as a "deluxe" studio with a "kitchenette. dining area and a seating area".  There was barely enough room to open the door into the tiny room  It is at best an efficiency apt. I could not imagine trying to actually cook anything on the little hot plate in that small a space. I have bruises on my legs just from trying to get around the bed.  There was no "seating area". There was a chair under a small desk with no room to pull it out. I am not exaggerating when I say this was simply a room with an extra sink and mini fridge. The bed is big enough for two but the room is not.,The neighborhood was lovely.
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Bennington,United States of America,1 review,May 24  2017,5.8,The room is very small. Parking was a problem. While the landlords knew 4 weeks before we were arriving the dates of our arrival. they could not coordinate parking. I saw empty parking behind the building. we were unable to use it. We had to find our own parking in the area. which is a problem. The landlord gave us no help whatsoever and did not respond to the two phone messages I left or the 4 emails I sent.,The bed was very comfortable. The room was very conveniently located. We were able to walk to the downtown area including the north end and historical sites. I felt very comfortable walking the whole way. The area close by had several restaurants and coffee shops which we visited and enjoyed each one.
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Paula,United States of America,1 review,May 22  2017,6.3,Room very small ([no bigger than 12x12]my partner and I could not be walking around at the same time).  Room HOT upon arrival (a/c not on).  Insufficient parking available on site for guests.  Multiple requests for parking 3-4 weeks prior to arrival unanswered.  Staff who answered call about parking rude and unhelpful at first. not much better 2nd time.  Not cheap (2 nights when all was said and done $490 + fees to park off site.  Will likely spring for the extra hundred bucks next time to stay in a hotel with a bigger room. in a better location. with parking (even if I have to pay for it). an elevator to the 6th floor. staff to respond to questions and concerns in a helpful manner.,Bed very comfortable.  (IKEA tempurpedic)
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Paul,Thailand,1 review,May 20  2017,5.4,The small room size with a queen bed that took up easily 60% of the space was annoying. With just the two of us. we felt like we were constantly climbing over everything. Never did figure out how to use the TV. Just overall not a good experience for that price. Would not stay there again. Called the management about the TV during the day. no one answered or even responded to a message I left.,We liked the location and neighborhood. Several nice restaurants in the area. Loved Boston. Metro system located about a 10-minute walk to Massachusetts Avenue. The Boston Museum of Fine Art. on the Green E line. is a must-see. Chinatown is full of great restaurants such as Pho Pasteur. Also recommend the Thai restaurant a few blocks from the place we stayed.
Concord Square by Short Term Rentals Boston,Linda,United States of America,1 review,May 18  2017,5.8,Much smaller than I realized. very tight for 2 people.  No place to sit.  Really impossible to eat in the room.,Bed was comfortable.  The room was EXTREMELY small.  Hard to carry suitcases up and down the stairs.  Only room to sleep and shower - nothing else.   Location is AMAZING.  Everything within walking distance.
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,October 16  2017,9.2,We found that the noise from the trains in the subway was very annoying especially from 6.00  am every morning. It could be heard clearly on the 16th floor til after midnight.,N/A
Hilton Boston Back Bay,bstoke boy,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 12  2017,8.8,The temperature in the lobby was way too cold. Yes Boston was enjoying a heatwave during our stay but the lobby was experiencing the opposite. Also whilst there are places to sit they aren't 'very comfortable',We had a lovely warm greeting from the young lady in reception. The room we had was spotless and it's in a great location for a tourist trip
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Peter,Norway,5 Reviews,October 9  2017,8.8,Overpriced for the season ($500 pr. room/night). but this applies to most hotels in the area. Breakfast options really poor and expensive. but great cafÃ© across the street.,Really good location downtown in Boston Back Bay Area. Excellent facilities and really comfortable rooms. Nice and friendly staff.
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Yasemin,Ireland,3 Reviews,September 26  2017,9.6,A deposit like sum of money is required when checking in aswell as your required overall fee.

Hilton Boston Back Bay,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 26  2017,9.6,Parking should be free. not 43 dollars a day. No free continental breakfast is a big negative especially with the amount i spent on room. Water in shower tub would not drain fastly and there was no fan in shower so alarm kept going off.,N/A
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 24  2017,6.3,but I fell like the facilities was not worth the cost of the room,Great customer service. Staff was always please to help and with a smile at all time.
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Rachel,United States of America,1 review,September 20  2017,9.2,Would have liked a small microwave to warm up leftovers. I also prefer a tub. not just a shower.,Very comfortable and clean. Staff was especially kind and helpful.
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Julianne,Canada,2 Reviews,September 19  2017,7.9,I didn't like the fact we were given a very poor room location (looked out the window at ventilation pipes and inner structure brick walls). Room was also older. Went to inquire about another room and was switched to beautiful room with nice view no problem. I didn't like the fact when checking out. I was charged $40 per night more thanQuoted on booking.com. Thankfully I still had my emails and after some time and discussion they made it right. This was a hassle and inconvenience. They handled the situation properly.,Very accommodating and friendly staff. Beds were very comfortable. Liked the location. close to great restaurants and shops yet quiet. Arrived at 10 am and room was ready.
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Colin,United States of America,1 review,September 18  2017,10,N/A,The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  The location is also excellent.  There are many bars. restaurants. things to do nearby. etc.  I would absolutely stay there again when I return to Boston.

Hilton Boston Back Bay,Salam,Saudi Arabia,11 Reviews,September 16  2017,5.8,Facilities and the lobby area is very basic. I also didn't like the fact that safety of the hote is not that strict. Anyone can enter the hotel. because there are two entrances. and the elevators take you to any level without using the hotel card. Which made me feel a bit uncomfortable,Location
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Erika,Australia,4 Reviews,September 12  2017,4.6,The room lighting is terrible. Our room(2109) had virtually no wifi &amp; was told it's too far away from the router &amp; use the pay for the high speed option which would be credited. The problem didn't fix &amp; we ended up being charged the $15 as well!. We booked a double bed room which when we complained that it must be a mistake as the size of the beds were marginally bigger than single we were told it's a 'Boston sizing'. We also pointed out that there was only one robe &amp; a few towels so must be a mistake giving us this room. We were promised extra's but only received some towels. Very disappointed from such a prestigious brand.,The location was good &amp; cleanliness of room was good.
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Karen,United Kingdom,1 review,August 26  2017,9.6,Room was 'accessible' as the only type with twin beds. My son is 6' tall and unfortunately the shower head only went as high as his chest so he had to crouch down to wash his hair ! Room was on the small side and the wardrobe had an ironing board in it which left no space for clothes. I put up the suitcase stand which then left very little room between the bed and wardrobe â˜¹ï¸�Room decor is very dark making night visits to the bathroom an interesting experience. You can't tell where the wall finishes and the door starts!,Good location for Fenway park and sightseeing (tour buses stop right outside)We were left extra water to drink by room staff ğŸ˜ŠPlenty of good restaurants within walking distance - fab seafood restaurant on the next block. Room comfy if a bit smallGreat view
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Kim,United States of America,1 review,August 26  2017,7.1,We arrived at 2:30. tried to check in and was told that our room wasn't ready. We came back at 4:30 (an 1/2 hour after check-in) and was still told that our room wasn't ready. although others around us were getting rooms.,The location for the purpose of our trip. which was Fenway Park.
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Jeffrey,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 22  2017,6.7,The hotel itself is average but the price is exclusive.  Details are lacking and the room quite small.  No fan. one hook. and a wire shelf in the shower that toiletries fell through in the bathroom were annoying.,The location is ideal for Fenway game and the on site parking was a great convenience and fairly priced for the location.  We got a "panoramic view" room which was worth the upgrade fee.  The free water was an appreciated detail.
Hilton Boston Back Bay,David,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,August 4  2017,9.2,Room keys didn't work first time although sorted out in  minutes.,Location at edge of Boylston Street (major shopping street) is great and very easy walk of 15 minutes to Fenway Park for the baseball which is highly recommended.
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Richard,United States of America,1 review,July 24  2017,9.2,Wi Fi not free and 43.00 per day to park ?

Hilton Boston Back Bay,Wong Oi Ling,Hong Kong,1 review,July 13  2017,9.6,N/A,It's convenient. It's close to the T at hynes conventional center along green line. Good restaurants and shops are nearby. All are in walkable distance.
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Marie,United States of America,1 review,June 17  2017,3.8,Night manager was rude when I walked into a plate glass window.   He got defensive rather than try to see if I was okay. and not injured.  Cleanliness in the spa was poor.  Air conditioning in our room blew right on the bed so I got sick.  Shower drain didn't work. but the maintenance did come up to clear it.,Room was nice and spacious.  Some of the staff were nice
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Christine,United States of America,1 review,June 9  2017,10,The only thing was the high prices for snacks and food. But with all the taxes in Boston it's hard to have low prices. But in the room they did have free coffee and tea and bottled water. So that helped a lot.  All in all it was a great place to stay.,Everyone at the hotel was very kind and went out of their way to provide whatever was needed. But also gave you your privacy if you wanted it. The food in the restaurant was excellent and the wait staff was very good. They remembered your name and what you liked to eat. They were attentive without hovering. Very caring. The people in housekeeping would give you privacy if you didn't want them coming into the room and they would provide you with whatever you needed when asked. They even called to make sure I was alright when I left the do not disturb sign on the door for several days. The people at the front desk were polite and tried to help out with any questions you had and help with purchasing snacks and providing information about payment options. Very good ğŸ˜Š place to stay. I would definitely stay again.
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Jose,Puerto Rico,2 Reviews,May 31  2017,7.9,Upon check out I was given an erroneous check out bill. they had to correct the rate I had confirmed thru Booking. com. Besides they had to correct the charges for the parking that I used overnight and they had charged for three nights. It look like they were bothered because of this changes when it was their error.,Location
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 31  2017,9.6,Could not get WiFi going.  Too cumbersome to connect.  Had to tether from our friends.  So disappointing!,Property was near Fenway Ballpark and Historical sites any shopping any good restaurants.
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Christin,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 30  2017,8.3,That you had to pay $43/night for parking. Should be included with the reservation. Also. free wifi?,We are a family of 5 and had booked a room with 2 beds. Upon our arrival. our room had only 1 king sized bed. We called the front desk and they immediately got us a new room. Within 5 minutes we were in our new room. Great customer service.
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Pamela,United States of America,1 review,May 29  2017,5.0,The room was Horrible!!   First. it was way to small for two double beds. a dresser. a desk w/ chair. an easy chair and an oversized night table (really a dresser).   It was also supposed to be handicapped accessible and it was way too crowded to accommodate an elderly person in a wheel chair.  The bathroom did have a hold bar but only inside the tub so one had to lean over the tub to hold on and get in.  No hold bar along rear of tub.this room should have been a single and definitely not labeled handicapped!Also. the hotel did not have a full service restaurant. just a Starbucks.,the  staff was pleasant and helpful.  When we had a plumbing problem they sent someone to repair it in 5 minutes.
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Delan,United States of America,1 review,May 23  2017,10,N/A,This is a very comfortable and centrally located hotel. The views are beautiful out the windows.

Hilton Boston Back Bay,Jacalyn,United States of America,1 review,May 18  2017,9.6,Free Breakfast could earn a 10,Location was beautiful. Plenty to do and everything was accessible. I love that it was literally a two-minute walk to the conversation center.
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Kristin,United States of America,1 review,May 2  2017,5.4,It's very small. There were few amenities. The pool area needs to be cleaned more often. The same bandaids were in the floor the whole time by the hot tub.  Very expensive for such a simple place.,The location by the convention center.
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Gypsymom,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 21  2017,4.6,Shower was not operational. it flooded the bathroom. the manager did not return my call and I not (or have yet to be) compensated for all of that.,Direct staff accommodating and pleasant
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Nicole,Australia,60 Reviews,April 20  2017,6.7,Buffet breakfast could be better. Need a proper bar that you can have drinks at. rather than just being a part of the restaurant. Servicing of the rooms was not great.,Perfect location.

Hilton Boston Back Bay,Jeana,United States of America,2 Reviews,February 12  2017,2.5,I was extremely excited to spend my 23rd birthday here since I spent my 21 birthday there. They must of changed management or hired new people because the staff that was on duty was high disrespectful. Racial discrimination was here at play. They let other guest that weren't legally allowed to check in under a room to check it but gave me a hard time about the 50$ for incidentals on a card when I had cash. And on booking through this website I have never had a problem at other hotels. They tried to speak down to me as if I was incompetent and I didn't understand. Even said the purpose is if I walk out with there TV! As if a 5 foot 3 inches female that weighs 120 would be able to carry a tv to the elevator across a lobby is very unlikely and I find it very humiliating that you would ever treat a guest that way. After I have given this place a top 10 rating and my Review even help  other people to stay here . I will never ever recommend anyone to stay at a Hilton hotel if they hire staff that are no willing to help. By the way they were quick to take my cash and have me waiting 30 mins just to confirm a card. I paid for the whole hotel room in advance and still didn't trust me even willing to pay the 50 in cash to hold. Funny how when people need money they are quick to take it but then want to talk about saving there asset,Nothing
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Joe,United States of America,1 review,February 6  2017,7.5,Terribly uncomfortable bed &amp; pillows. Contemplated sleeping on floor at one point. Really. poor enough quality to warrant this review. Tv was useless outside of selecting channel by hitting +/- on the remote. Every other function seemed to be malfunctioning. Wanted to watch a movie at end of night. So much for that...We Stayed on the top floor "corner superior panoramic view" room. After seeing photos. I assumed we would have a nice view of downtown Boston. Instead. we stared straight into a condo building and had broken views of Brookline/western Boston. If the architects Wanted to ensure a poor view. they certainly hit home. Much better options in the area for the decerning traveler.,Friendly staff. and very clean throughout. Great location in the heart of back bay next to prudential center.

Hilton Boston Back Bay,Sarah,United States of America,1 review,January 10  2017,9.2,Wasn't impressed with the pillows. as minuscule as that is.  And the front desk should explain upon check-in. that if you park in the attached parking garage. you have to always come down to lower level to access front lobby/elevators to rooms.,The location was excellent for catching the T as well as shopping/restaurants.

Hilton Boston Back Bay,Andre,United States of America,1 review,December 17  2016,3.8,The hottub was broken when we specifically called a few days before making our reservation to make sure they had one. which was only a few days before our stay. The bathroom had a nasty stain on the floor. I had to wait almost an hour for our room to be ready. The pool and gym area was freezing cold and pool was much smaller than it looked in the picture.,The room was nice. There was plenty of storage and the bed was very comfortable.
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Makiko,Japan,14 Reviews,December 15  2016,7.1,The whole thing didn't look like one at 5-star hotel - the lobby. entrance. room. and toilet were really small. and everything looked old. Also. there was a really dusty tiny balcony in the room.Their bedding smelled like someone who didn't have shower for a few days. they probably didn't change?I ordered room service and which came so fast but the foods were in microwavable plastic containers - although the taste was okay. it was really disappointing.I think the Sheraton hotel located just opposite is much bigger and the quality should be better.,Great location!

Great deal for the money.
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Denise,Ireland,2 Reviews,November 8  2016,7.5,The concierge desk is not staffed half the time.  The coffee/ tea machine was rather poor for a Hilton Hotel.  The Starbucks in the lobby had odd hours of business - better to go to the branch across the road in the Sheraton Hotel.  There was no family room in the lobby for people to use who have checked out at 11am yet don't fly until later that night.,The room was very clean. It was convenient for the tour and the airport shuttle bus. Facing the Prudential Centre also.  There is also now complimentary wi-fi in the room.

Hilton Boston Back Bay,Jonathan,United States of America,1 review,August 16  2016,6.7,The fact that parking at the hotel was nearly 25% as much as the room rate was not presented clearly. at all.

Hilton Boston Back Bay,Stephanie,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 7  2016,7.1,I had paid for a panoramic view and all I got was facing a tall building with no view at all.  I was told that all panoramic rooms were all the same facing that building!  I was not offered to change rooms with a view - panoramic or not.  Nothing was noted on the website prior to me booking the room that there was NO view in the panoramic rooms. even though those rooms were more expensive!Also - LOTS of construction around the hotel.  Noisy in the morning and hard to get around with all of the road blocks.,N/A
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Mohsin,Pakistan,2 Reviews,August 6  2016,5.0,Poor front desk service. The clerk apparently did not know how to run credit cards and almost gave me a panic attack by telling me that none of my cards were declined. Luckily I was able to use my card on file with Booking.com. To my relief. I checked all my cards either by buying food and making ATM withdrawals as soon as I left the hotel and they were all working just fine.And worst of all. I was not given an invoice upon checkout because apparently the printer was broken. I requested the invoice to be emailed to me. However none of the emails mentioned the total amount billed. I had to manually calculate it by adding the items.,The location was good. The hotel was generally clean and the staff was professional with the exception of the front desk staff.
Hilton Boston Back Bay,David,United States of America,1 review,August 2  2016,10,Well if the pool could be open all night but I'm sure it's more of a safety issue but it would be nice extended hours maybe,Staff is so helpful about the tours and very helpful about where to eat even the housekeepers were helpful the gym has great equipment awesome pool had it all to myself he he on Friday
Hilton Boston Back Bay,Rebecca,United States of America,1 review,August 2  2016,6.7,Some clientele. especially young men were obnoxious in the pool and deck area.

The view was great and staff were friendly.

Copley Garrison,Deidre,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 24  2017,8.8,Laundry was shared coin-op in the basement and no supplies (soap. basket. change machine) on site. Dryer  only partially dried clothes and left everything very wrinkled.Wi-fi was slow and spotty at best.Parking on the street is 2 hours during the day and you MUST display a residential permit at night. I was ticketed $40 for misunderstanding the residential parking only situation. The garage across the street was $40/day but no in/our privileges. Just donâ€™t drive. Uber or use public transport.,Everything was in working order. the location was SUPER convenient. The building was easy to access via supplied codes.
Copley Garrison,Neil,United Kingdom,1 review,October 20  2017,5.0,Looked great in the pictures. but reality was a little disappointing. Needed a good clean and maintenance. Air con filthy and slats falling off. cabinet  doors worn (and one fell off every time opened).  TV remote controls missing the battery covers. Also room was at the back of the building and quite dark with little natural light.,Location was great for back bay station and for exploring Boston in general.
Copley Garrison,Sharon,Australia,30 Reviews,October 13  2017,8.3,Bedroom light didnâ€™t work and I emailed twice about it not working. We had a five night stay and it was only fixed on our last night. Wifi was extremely slow and only worked when standing near front door. At times. the Wifi didnâ€™t work at all.,When we checked in the girl in reception was very helpful and friendly. The office was open until quite late at night. The apartment was in a quiet neighbourhood and in a convenient location. It was a good sized apartment. There was an excellent supermarket within a five minute walk of apartment.
Copley Garrison,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 13  2017,7.5,The neighbors was bother us all the time even if you laugh. We felt every uncomfortable,It was really nice the host was amazing the apartment was beautiful and stocked
Copley Garrison,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 12  2017,8.8,Someone who worked at the property waited at the door till I pulled up the email with the door code and wouldn't let us in while we were standing there with bags to ensure that we actually were going to stay there.... As I was carrying all my bags and hadn't marked the email. it took me a little while to find it and he just watched me fumble with my phone the whole time and asked if I was sure I was staying there. Was very uncomfortable. I understand the need for security. but I was standing there with all my luggage after a red eye flight and just didn't think that was the attitude to have toward a guest of the place. We didn't see anyone else during the stay though.,Nice. quite apartment with modern appliances and furnishings all to yourself! I loved the layout and how close it was to Newbury Street. MFA. and Boston Commons. They were able to accommodate our late check out too.
Copley Garrison,Maria,Panama,13 Reviews,September 13  2017,10,Nothing! Everything is great. Just for info. if you go in summer. only one of the  two rooms in the apartment has air conditioning. The other has a fan. The air conditioning is not in all the apartment.,The apartment was beautiful. very spacious and greatly furnished. It was very complete. The area is superb. very central. but still quite. The check in/check out process very simple.The apartment was clean and great for a family! Definitely come back!!!
Copley Garrison,Malcolm,Australia,15 Reviews,September 2  2017,9.6,No lift to the 5th floor. Office was a short walk away.,It was so roomy. Bedroom. kitchen and lounge. Half our walk to the city. Great  grocery store nearby. Easy to get to airport. Very comfortable.
Copley Garrison,Paul,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,July 16  2017,7.5,Bed very uncomfortable. Mattress really needs replacing as a massive dip towards the centre of it! Sleep was definitely lost due to this.,Facilities/communication with hosts.Location is good. Just a short subway to centre.
Copley Garrison,Carolyn,United States of America,1 review,July 11  2017,9.2,Lots of stairs after a long day. and there was no on-site way to get laundry detergent or fabric softener for the on-site laundry. so I had to buy more than I needed.,Excellent locationâ€”I could walk anywhere. and if I didn't want to walk. the T was really close!  I also liked the apartment-style room: I like eating in. The on-site laundry facilities were also useful.
Copley Garrison,Giuseppe,Canada,2 Reviews,June 25  2017,6.7,Well...the place had no tea towels to clean dishes. very little dish soap to do the dishes. there was no dishwasher soap in the event you wanted to use the dishwasher. The internet was useless and could not get a signal during the entire three days we stayed there. Had to go use a wifi hot-spot at nearby hotel.,Location was ideal if you want to stay in Back Bay area. Having Train station nearby was the best.
Copley Garrison,Jill,Australia,21 Reviews,June 25  2017,6.7,The place wasn't as clean as it should have been. A dirty. stained bedcover greeted us and it was generally a bit grotty. It would have been nice to have some tea/coffee supplies and the internet kept dropping out.,Close to the train station and the shopping mall. the location was good. It was a nice neighbourhood. The apartment is a good size.
Copley Garrison,Daiva,Lithuania,8 Reviews,June 23  2017,7.1,there is no elevator in the property and it is difficult to climb quite narrow and quite steep stairs with heavy bags if your room is on higher floor. bedroom was very small.,good location. guite well equipped kitchen
Copley Garrison,Toni,Australia,12 Reviews,June 23  2017,8.3,It's a shame there were no teabags or long life milk  provided.,This is a lovely historic area to stay. It is within easy walking of Back Bay railway station.

Copley Garrison,Anonymous,Canada,1 review,June 7  2017,7.1,The place had lots of room for two people but needed a good cleaning. The baseboards and side tables were dusty and a new paint job wouldn't hurt. The bedding and pillows were not great. It would be a two star at a four start price in another city but Boston is very expensive for accommodations.,The location was great easy access to subway. food and shopping.
Copley Garrison,Mags,United Kingdom,1 review,June 2  2017,6.3,Air con very very noisy! 51 stairs to the top very hot apartment! Could do with a bit of an update overall!

Copley Garrison,United,United Kingdom,1 review,May 24  2017,10,Wifi could have been better.,Central property but quiet.Easy access from airport and no hassle with keys.Spacious property and supplied with all amenities including shampoo etc.
Copley Garrison,Winnie,Australia,4 Reviews,May 13  2017,7.1,We requested late check-out and was confirmed via email. But the door code was changed at normal check-out time. Our luggage locked inside. no one on site to talk to. Major major hassle. Almost missed it the flight. That's unacceptable. anyone could imagine the inconvenience and anxiety of the whole issue. I was going to give this place 10 out of 10 if it wasn't because of the last bit.,Keyless door code emailed to us make it v easy
Copley Garrison,Josie,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 13  2017,6.3,The bed is awful in this apartment. The mattress sinks in the middle. So very poor sleep condition. The bedding. especially the  comforters was not up to par. It had white stains which I found totally gross. Would not cover ourselves with it. The bedroom has no TV. so if you want to watch TV in bed you can't. The living room is pretty drafty especially the one with the AC window unit. It is taped up with some kind of material that allows all the outside air to come through so it's drafty in cool weather and I'm sure it would not be cool in warmer weather for same reason. This would be a great apartment if these things are fixed.,The location is amazing. Check im and check out also very well handled.
Copley Garrison,Brenda,Ireland,2 Reviews,April 11  2017,9.2,No local information left in Apartment which was a bit disappointing.   Draft in window where air conditioning unit wasn't properly fitted!,Location of property was excellent with easy access to T and main attractions. Instructions for access to property were accurate and easy to follow.
Copley Garrison,Roger,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,April 5  2017,10,Could have provided coffee/tea/milk as most UK flights land late in evening.,Unlike a standard hotel. One bed apartment with all facilities available. Easy to contact staff a few hundred yards away in another property.
Copley Garrison,Adam,United Kingdom,1 review,March 2  2017,7.5,Had to request the spare towels as none had been left. The washing up liquid had run out (but there was dishwasher detergent).

Carlo provides good customer service.
Copley Garrison,Sharon,United States of America,2 Reviews,November 11  2016,10,Entryway to building should be updated.  It gives poor first impression. but apt. more than makes up for this minor point.,Fantastic location one block from Copley and Prudential shopping areas.

Copley Garrison,Ncholas,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,October 29  2016,6.3,Sadly the apartment was tired in decor. and main appliances. The wifi was a joke. at one point i managed to get the best result of a mighty 0.2mbs. That is when it did not disappear completely. Let us down when trying to research local places and directions.,Lovely little apartment. with some character... Supurb location to access the city.  local shops and points of interest.
Copley Garrison,Barbara,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 19  2016,8.3,The bed (mattress) needs to be thrown out.  It was lumpy and saggy.,It was a FABULOUS spot to stay for our vacation!  Great location. everything we needed was provided. the staff stored our luggage for us on our last day so we could do more sightseeing!
Copley Garrison,Ld,United States of America,1 review,October 12  2016,8.3,The apartment was quite well worn in some aspects. especially the bathroom and kitchen. It wasn't a big deal for us since we were out most of the day. but it would have been an issue in long term stay.,This modified brownstone was exactly what we needed. Although the apartment doesn't come with the usual hotel services. we were really happy with the location and communication with management. Our apartment was clean and comfortable.
Copley Garrison,Dorota,Belgium,17 Reviews,October 10  2016,8.3,The staircase of the building was a bit dirty.,We liked the helpful staff and the fact that we could store our luggage in the office just by the residence.

Copley Garrison,Pauline,United Kingdom,25 Reviews,September 26  2016,8.8,The common area approach to the apartment was very offputting and needed refurbishing.

The apartment was spacious. very clean bathroom and bed linen. flat was tidy and had most everything you could need. lots of storage. hanging space. kitchen equipment. Air conditioning worked. We walked from the apartment to the common and then to Charlestown. Lots of shops locally
Copley Garrison,Anonymous,Australia,16 Reviews,July 2  2016,5.8,Our suite was not very clean. Very dusty and no attention had been paid to all areas of the apartment (eg: bathroom).The suite was also smelly - the rugs and couch need to be dry cleaned. the cushion covers need to be changed (stains on them) and timber floors mopped with disinfectant.If the apartment were clean and fresh. it would have been a wonderful place to stay. For the price paid. one should not have to even consider cleanliness as an issue.,The location was excellent; easy walking distance to many places of interest. and steps away from a metro station.The building was secure and safe in a quiet neighbourhood.Spacious apartment.Great. fast wifi.

Staff was very accommodating when we could hear the people upstairs walking/stomping around.  They moved us quickly and with no judgment.  They also allowed us to stay in the room until 1PM. as our flight wasn't until later.  The flat is great and felt like home.
Copley Garrison,Maria,United States of America,6 Reviews,January 2  2016,9.2,Bedroom faced alleyway where rubbish and recycling was loudly collected on Monday. Not the property's fault. but annoying.

Copley Garrison,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,November 3  2015,7.1,The place was clean in that the sheets and towels were clean which is good but overall the apartment was tired looking and the heating system was not great.

Boston Marriott Copley Place,Sharon,Ireland,16 Reviews,November 2  2017,9.6,Having to pay for WiFi while in the room. and it free in the lobby area. that's was disappointing.,The hotel is really nice and located perfectly for anyone that would love to explore Boston. The room was very comfortable and it had everything in it we needed. The swimming pool and gym area are a bonus. was spotless and relaxing.
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Glenn,United States of America,1 review,October 30  2017,9.6,Prices were higher than expected. The charges for valet parking were excessive. Best thing to do is use taxis or hurt.,Everything was great.  Location is great.  Access to two great malls with excellent restaurants.
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Peter,Malta,8 Reviews,October 18  2017,9.6,Wifi was not free. We upgraded the rooms to get the free wifi.,Central location and good selection of restaurants around the hotel. All the staff were very friendly. from the doormen who hail your taxi. to the housekeeping lady. to the reception and concierge staff. We stayed on the 21st floor and had very comfortable rooms with great views over the city. Would definitely go back if we were in Boston again.
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Davidson,Australia,4 Reviews,October 17  2017,9.2,It would be nice to have tea facilities in the room.  There is only one inhouse restaurant which was very sport oriented.  Meant we had to go out for dinner every night. which when you have been travelling and are tired is not always pleasant.,The beds and linen were first class. really comfortable.  The room itself was pristine and the shower was great.
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 3  2017,9.2,The breakfast was overpriced.  We ate at rye Starbucks after the first day.  Also the WiFi hookup was confusing.,Great location.  Close to Freedom Trail and Fenway.  The bar was fun to watch the Patriots and Red Sox.  The Concierge Staff was great in giving us tips and arranging tours.

Boston Marriott Copley Place,Andrew,United States of America,1 review,September 14  2017,2.5,When we arrived. the hotels front doors were broken and out of order. We entered through a side door. After a long flight and only 3 hours of sleep from the night before. I was assigned a room that I was uncomfortable sleeping in. due to its lack of cleanliness. There was duct tape on the carpet outside of my room to keep it from fraying further. Inside of the room. as lay down to take a nap before my other guests arrived. I noticed a stain on my sheets. I looked around the room and noticed public hair on the toilet seat. dirty glassware. furniture that hadn't been dusted in weeks. and an awful smell. Not a fun start to my vacation.,Location was right near the public transit. however. we decided to uber instead.
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Steve,United States of America,1 review,September 11  2017,8.8,Way too pricey for the money spent. Requested high level floor. put on the 12th floor. Thought I was paying more for the higher floor request when I booked. Would probably book at the Copley Westin next time.,Room was clean (but small). Very quiet.
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Paul,United States of America,6 Reviews,September 6  2017,7.9,I don't like paying for parking of any kind. so I guess that is my only gripe.  $ 40.00 to park in the lot.,Good hotel.  Typical of what you will find in a Major city.  Room was small but nice.  The pool and sauna were nice.  Plenty of towels.  The weight room is awesome
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Rachel,United States of America,1 review,September 5  2017,4.2,It is kind of ridiculous at the price for the hotel that parking is not included or validated AND that the wifi was not free. Also. I could not log on to the wireless network after MANY attempts of trying  from our room. That is just absolutely unacceptable and I will not be staying at this hotel again.,N/A

Boston Marriott Copley Place,Dheeraj,Japan,2 Reviews,September 2  2017,2.9,NO WIFI. only paid WIFI and li and behold almost $13 a day. crazy! No complimentary water - water bottle in room is $ 5 !!!!asked for warm milk from in room dining and I got the WEIRDEST OF WEIRDEST REPLIES- "The state of Massachusetts has a law that hotels cannot heat milk and serve " . What kind of a reply is that - how is it possible? How do you make a cappuccino ? This is an absolute lie .After complaining several times someone emails that it was a mistake. that's all . After that no communications housekeeping gets a toothbrush after two calls and a 35 minute wait ! PATHETIC,The location
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Teresa,United States of America,1 review,August 21  2017,10,I wish that the self parking wasn't so expensive. I also couldn't help but get annoyed at how late the maid would come to make up the room. She would come every day around 4PM while my husband and I were getting ready for dinner. so we never actually got our room made up. They were very happy to give us fresh towels and they were very pleasant. I just wish they would have come earlier while we were out sightseeing. But not a deal breaker. we loved the hotel.,The hotel was very clean and a great proximity to most major attractions. I loved that we did not have to use our car once. The elevators were fast and simple to use. We were in town for some baseball games and it was close enough to Fenway to either walk or take a pedicab or taxi. Great Hotel.
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Armand,United States of America,1 review,August 21  2017,9.2,The bed was the only downside...not very comfy at all!The matress had some thick plastic cover under the sheet that made us sweat like it was 100 degrees in the room!,Loved the customer service!The room was average but provided what we needed for this getaway.
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Lauren,United States of America,1 review,August 6  2017,7.5,There was no microwave or fridge in the room. Perhaps this is to bring more business to the hotel restaurant. and convenient store. But it is the reason I wouldn't stay here again. We had to toss all leftovers. even from the hotel restaurant. There's no where around to buy a cooler. the vending machine was broken. We paid for an expensive exquisite dinner and after appetizers we were full so guess what? We had to throw out the 75% of our meal we couldn't eat.,The bed was comfortable. view was great. location was perfect.
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Wilma,United States of America,1 review,August 4  2017,6.7,A LOT...Booking.com screwed up my reservation. The Marriott had norecord of it when I called from the road to tell them that I would be alate arrival. I had to rebook and it cost me more than $100.00 . morethan my original booking. I will not use your service again. Nor will Irecommend you to anyone. The hotel was filled with oud .drunk frat boyson a reunion and they wandered to places they did not belong and talkedvery loudly in the halls until after 1 am. I also requested a foampillowand it took over an hour to get it. Certainly soured an experience.,The view ...Bed was comfortable...
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Steve,United States of America,1 review,July 24  2017,4.6,Price. room service. friendliness.,The property is over-priced and not especially customer friendly.

Long wait times. unfriendly staff. pre-packaged (not fresh) food delivered to my room in a paper bag.
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Andrea,Uruguay,1 review,July 16  2017,8.3,length of time to check in was long and parking cost was not as quoted on website .... $60.00 added to hotel bill was pretty steep for any town in US!,bed was very comfortable. location was awesome. pedicabs best thing in Boston .... driver incredibly nice and got us in and out of traffic to Fenway in 5 minutes...car valet indoors and out were great!
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Kristin,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 11  2017,7.5,Room service - limited menu and all comes in take away containers.,Very clean. safe hotel.  Felt very comfortable staying there with my own nieces.  We booked a double room.  The bathroom was a little small. but overall the room was fine and met our needs.  We were slightly disappointed when we ordered room service. expecting the cart with the silver domes. and then the staff showed up with all take-away containers.  Took some of the fun out of ordering room service.  Overall. it was a great stay.
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 5  2017,9.2,There was this young man. did not get name. who checked me in that was slightly snotty.It was due to problem with my credit card. which was cleared later. due to misunderstanding on my part.I understand that there must have been people that have be fraudulent in the past but the attitude was still not customer friendly.That was the only hiccup in my entire stay.Free WiFi in the room would have been nice but the WiFi at the conference room was good.,LOVED the location.

Boston Marriott Copley Place,Alfi1095,United States of America,1 review,June 18  2017,7.9,Our room wasn't ready. but they "upgraded" us to the "luxury suite."

Boston Marriott Copley Place,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,May 31  2017,6.7,The rooms were very small and did not offer free wifi to guest.

Boston Marriott Copley Place,Jeanette,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 30  2017,7.9,The room only has one mirror which is in the bathroom. This made it difficult to get ready to go out if one person was using the shower or the toilet. There was no fan to keep the mirror from foggy up. There was nowhere to hang wet towels. The only option was something on the back of the bathroom door but it didn't hold a towel very well.,The bed was comfortable. The location was excellent. Walking distance to lots of great activities.

Boston Marriott Copley Place,George,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 20  2017,8.3,I thought for sure with a lot of occupants staying at the hotel. the hotel would at least provide bananas. water and snacks for the runners the morning of the race.

Boston Marriott Copley Place,Susan,United States of America,1 review,February 21  2017,7.9,The hotel has changed soooo much since my last visit. I used to go there once a year for quite a while. The lobby has no more real nice decorations for the various holidays. No more cookies available at check in.  Fewer restaurant choices in the hotel. no cocktail lounge and music and the room had no refrigerator and was much smaller since the hotel made a huge renovation.,The beds were very comfortable. shower good and room temperature good. Large TV very nice. Very clean and nice room view. Good valet parking and excellent staff. I liked the shopping there and walkway to other stores at the Westin. I also really liked the taxi service availability from the hotel.
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Susan,United States of America,1 review,February 17  2017,10,N/A,Great location and area restaurants. Close to shopping. the Boston Commons and many great restaurants to choose from. All within walking distance of hotel. Hotel room was clean and  beds were comfortable. We had an awesone view of the river and city ( which we requested)  as did the 4 couples we traveled with that also stayed at the hotel. Check- in went smoothly and front desk employees were very helpful with all questions/needs. We arrived after 6:30pm on a Friday and the Concierge was very  helpful with getting us a reservation at an amazing restaurant  where the food was excellent.    We enjoyed dinners at Lucca and at Abe &amp; Louie's (where we met friends - party of 10 - and service was fantastic). We plan on returning for another weekend get-a-way.

Great value when it's even cheaper than the ones in Kenmore or Fenway.

The hotel was extremely busy. The staff was wonderful. We where greeted by a happy door man.  upon check in their was no one in the preferred gest check in so they called us over to check in.  They could not find one of our rooms.  The woman checking us in was polite to apologize on the delay and gave us the information.  She was able to get us our two rooms next to each other.  We ate at the hotel for New Years eve because everything on the street was to busy (no prior reservations) the service was understandably slow.  The food and service where great.  The location for us was walking distance to Copley Place and the Boston Gardens.  Short cab ride to the Seaport District.

I mean it is what it is but no one wants a warm water when expecting it to be cold.,The bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on. I wish I could of stayed longer. I also liked how busy it was. always something going on. When my boyfriend and I found out there was a breakfast buffet in the morning we were so excited. we didn't have to leave the hotel. And a mall right there. and again don't even have to leave. Great hotel. I highly suggest it.

Boston Marriott Copley Place,Matthew,United States of America,3 Reviews,January 2  2017,5.8,Room was just OK not what you would expect for $350/night. Took one hour to check in and no valet parking. Told we were "own our own when it came to our car." Hotel was full of 14-22 year olds and noise level was high until 3:30AM.,Proximity to shopping and restaurants.
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Patricia,United States of America,3 Reviews,January 2  2017,9.6,The desk lamp light bulb was out.Tiny bathroom.Busy night...elevators were slowwwNo info in the room about the great breakfast buffet. The room phone didnt have Concierge listed. Looking for breakfaSt option I finally just called Security. Great guy answered told us where to go. Awesome!,Great breakfast buffet on New Years Day.
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Michael,United States of America,3 Reviews,January 2  2017,9.6,Unloading my car. the person that brought the cart stood there and watched.then he walked away and I started bringing in my own luggage. Not what I expected after spending the laSt ten years there for z New Years.,The counter person realized that I had a disability and placed me in a handicap accessible room with out me asking. He did this on his own. I was very gratful.
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,December 30  2016,8.3,Check process is ridiculously slow. Long line for check in and too few staff to process everyone in a timely way. 15 minutes to check in!,Good location for seeing Boston .
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Circle,United States of America,1 review,December 26  2016,10,N/A,Everything was great from the staff to amenities.

Boston Marriott Copley Place,Maria,Qatar,9 Reviews,December 23  2016,9.6,Forgot to use the pool..would be Great tombe remindo of amenities on check in. We were sad we did not experience the facilities.,The location is excellent and the staff were Very cheerful. The viÃ©s on the 30th floor was brilliant.
Boston Marriott Copley Place,New,United States of America,1 review,December 19  2016,10,Rude cab drivers who have no patience for hotel guests. I didn't like the fact that I had to self park because Valet was full. There should be parking lot access for hotel guests. I'm accustom to VIP treatment and being my first time ever spending the night in Boston my expectations were low but I didn't expect to carry my luggage from the 3rd floor garage through the mall into the lobby. The drive in the city is already what it is (unfriendly) the last thing I want to experience is more of the same the second I pull into the hotel.,I liked the fact that there was Free ice...annoying when I have to search for coins just to get ice. Easy walk to the Hub for dinner.Access to a good atmosphere for drinking and talking to friends.Staff was very informative and kind.
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Michael,United States of America,2 Reviews,December 14  2016,9.6,The $38 price tag for overnight self-parking seemed very high.,The front desk staff was very friendly and efficient.  The hotel was spotlessly clean!  We booked a great deal on the room through Booking.com.  The room was very comfortable and the view from the 36th floor amazing!
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Glynis,United States of America,5 Reviews,December 13  2016,9.2,A good restaurant would have been nice. Shower head was not helpful for those of us with thick hair. We need forceful stream.Thanks,Great bed. Great location. Thanks
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Chantelle,Ireland,3 Reviews,December 10  2016,10,Everything was up to standard and beyond,I loved the large room. friendly staff and central location. Superb value for money. I would recommend and definitely stay again.
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Christian,United States of America,4 Reviews,December 2  2016,8.8,The inside of the hotel could use some updating to be a bit more modern and keep up with the times. The rooms are a bit small. but definitely very clean. The service at the restaurant. Champions. is pretty terrible. and doesn't live up to the Marriott standard. I would retrain all of the servers and staff to be more customer focused. and learn their POS a bit more. The servers barely came around. and I was charged the incorrect check and after bringing it to their attention. I had both charges on my account. Thankfully. the incorrect charge was eventually removed.,The staff was pretty nice. and the hotel is huge and connected to Copley Place. which is a high end mall with boutiques. I also liked the warm cider they put out at night since it's so cold this time of year. There's a big supermarket across the street. which is super convenient. since Boston restaurants tend to be pretty pricey. There's also another mall. the Prudential Center. right across the street and connected to the hotel through the 2nd floor. Overall. a great place with a great location.
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Elizabeth,United States of America,1 review,November 28  2016,9.6,The bed could have been comfier. but other than that - no complaints!,Staff were very friendly &amp; helpful.  Room was very clean. everything worked well.  Overall great stay!
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Jeanne,United States of America,4 Reviews,November 27  2016,7.5,Please have a map of Boston and the public transit system in the room.  Perhaps on the hotel's TV access menu?,The feather top mattress was very comfortable. Our room on the 36th floor looked over the eastern side of the harbor and brownstone houses. The staff were pleasant. Room service was prompt and food good.
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,November 20  2016,7.9,The bed was somehow lumpy,The mirror after shower. the vapor on it and the bathroom light made my eyes look cartooneshly demonic. A bit shocking but funny overall.
Boston Marriott Copley Place,Anton,Switzerland,71 Reviews,October 17  2016,8.8,The swimming pool is a bit small and outdated.,The location was good. The staff was amazing. special thanks to Yaroslav at the front desk who was very polite and helpful
Studio on Arch Street Apt 4B,Elizabeth,United States of America,4 Reviews,June 7  2017,9.2,There was not an elevator from the street level to the level where the apartment was.,The apartment had everything that I needed. was walking distance to my work site and shopping as well as a short ride from the airport.
Charles River Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 30  2017,3.3,Place is kind of run down and out dated for the price.Base board for heater on the floor on one side of the room.No screen in the window. paint peeling on the ceilings.Quite &amp; safe enough didn't see any bugs or other pest.Staff just kind of did there own thing weren't really friendly or not friendly just kind of there.Bus line is about a half a mile away.IHOP . Mcdonalds.  Starbucks .iIt was just ok.,Nice Location
Charles River Inn,Riley,United States of America,1 review,October 25  2017,8.8,Its no 5 star hotel but it's well worth what you're paying for. I don't have anything negative to say about the place.,15 minutes outside downtown Boston. free parking. The price is half of what you'd pay downtown. it's a no brainer to stay here as opposed to downtown if you're here for business and not pleasure.
Charles River Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 24  2017,6.3,Door lock was broken for 3 of 4 days. some key tv channels were very fuzzy. keys on phone didn’t work. bottoms of dresser drawers sagged out of slots. Staff not fast to turn things around. Some staff were very nice though. They could only do so much themselves.  Low price but wondering whether it was worth it.,Small breakfast offering at Inn 6:30am - 9:30am. Next door to IHOP. 24 hour food.
Charles River Inn,Cindy,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 24  2017,8.3,The room needs a makeover.,Overall stay was good. Staff is very nice. Room could have been cleaner (cobwebs on the ceiling). Room had ripped wallpaper— needs a makeover.
Charles River Inn,John,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 23  2017,4.2,The hotel was undergoing renovation and the place was a mess.  Not only was our room in a poor state (hopefully not a renovated room) there were tradesmen working on our floor.  The place was dirty as a result.  A better plan for the renovations should have been in place (i.e. closing off floors) but it would seem that there was little concern for the guests.,Very little - obviously
Charles River Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 23  2017,4.2,The inn is badly in need of  updating.   Paint is peeling off the walls.   The baseboards are filthy. The windows are dirty.  The carpets are shabby.  The shower didn't work,N/A
Charles River Inn,Julie,United States of America,1 review,October 23  2017,7.9,There were quick cosmetic fixes to the wallpaper and other smaller areas that don't look great but really didn't impact our stay.,The place seems to be under renovation. and we lucked out with a nice room.  At least the carpeting in our room was new. the bathroom was clean. bedding was clean.  The beds were comfortable. the AC worked well.  We slept great.  The hotel is close to where we wanted to be and the parking was free.  So we have no complaints and will likely stay here again.
Charles River Inn,Britt,United States of America,1 review,October 21  2017,10,Everything was great. I had no issues during my stay.,The bed was so comfortable I didnt want to leave . and the location was so convenient right next to my favorite food spots.
Charles River Inn,Hess,Switzerland,1 review,October 19  2017,2.9,Old. rusted and outdated hotel bathroom&amp;doors have seen better days like seriously  Was so dity the rooms were smelly thick dark carpet. Loud noise from outside the highway all night long and when people speak we heard it clearly from inside. Not worthy a coin I paid for coz we did even wanted to see how worse is the breakfast. Aircon was fixed on place with some grey sponge and out night light didn't work so we had on tablelight.. I ask for cancellation but no refunds as I booked for 2days. Worse place I ever stayed.,Safe if you are in Boston with a car. It's secured. Big parking lot.
Charles River Inn,Avi,United States of America,1 review,October 16  2017,3.3,The beds were uncomfortable. the bathrooms need updating and thorough cleaning.  There was a large crack in the sink.  No iron in bedrooms.  The mini fridge was noisy.  The door frames were rusting.  given the property condition it was overpriced.,What do I find good about this place? - Location and price.  That it.  relatively speaking they were charging less than other locations but to be honest I think it is still way over priced.  You are paying for location.
Charles River Inn,Ellie,United States of America,1 review,October 16  2017,3.8,Where to start! It was run down and very basic. More like a motel. The receptionist looked like he would rather be elsewhere and didn’t seem very bothered about anything. We decided that we would pay at the hotel so we could split and pay cash (which it said you could do). however they tried to charge my card earlier on in the day. Luckily it was declined. but he couldn’t tell me which of my cards I had put on there so I could look into why it was declined. As there were 4 of us we wanted to pay separately. but we were told to either pay all cash (providing it was the right amount as he could not offer change). or all on one card. If you offer cash services you NEED to have change! If it would have said online. we would have made sure we had the right money. When I told him it said it online he didn’t care much.The room was run down and the bath was dirty. only manageable for one night if all you need is a bed. It’s about 5 miles out of the main city. so we got taxis in with little public transport links around.. Ok if there’s a group of you but would get pricey if you are on your own!,Good size room
Charles River Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 16  2017,7.9,A little run down. but looks like improving as they go. New carpet and bathroom sinks. comfortable bed. but room heater repaired with duct tape and tub has seen better days. Good price for area. especially with free parking.,Free parking. nice staff
Charles River Inn,Bernard,United States of America,1 review,October 16  2017,9.2,The hotel is next to a busy road,Great value for a no-nonsense hotel close to Cambridge/Boston.   Free breakfast and free WIFI.  Spacious and comfortable room with all expected amenities.
Charles River Inn,Tim,Australia,10 Reviews,October 15  2017,5.0,We were told property under renovation. Carpets laying in corridors. mould and cracking on ceiling &amp; walls in bathroom. electric plugs not working. Overpriced for this standard.,Outside of Boston. handy to locals areas
Charles River Inn,Janet,United States of America,1 review,October 13  2017,9.2,Little outdated but is undergoing renovations to guest rooms. Would have liked to have coffee and tea available all day not just at breakfast.,Convenient location. free on site parking. staff helpful and friendly. Bed very comfortable.  IHOP. McDonalds. Starbucks and Staples across the parking lot.
Charles River Inn,Anonymous,Canada,4 Reviews,October 12  2017,5.0,Bed was not made up when they cleaned our room the first night. New glasses were not provided. Did not remove dirty coffee cups. Did not give us four towels for four people. Breakfast was the worst we have experienced. No bread left. only fruit loops for a cereal choice. only one type of jam for toast. and coffee was very weak.,N/A
Charles River Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,17 Reviews,October 12  2017,4.6,Smell in bedrooms: Glue ?Breakfast is not attractive. Tables are dirty. Not enough space for all guests. Very limited choice.Way overpriced for the poor quality of the rooms and breakfast.,Location was convenient. Staff was nice.
Charles River Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 11  2017,9.6,Breakfast was skimpy.TV was minimal.no elevator.,Reasonable price.close to family we were visiting.updating and improvements were happening. staff was very friendly and accommodating. bed comfortable
Charles River Inn,Elizabeth,United States of America,1 review,October 9  2017,3.3,Mold on the bathroom ceiling and the room smelled bad of an unidentifiable scent. The only saving grace was the bed was comfortable and the sheets appeared clean. We needed a space to lay our heads for 6 hours; it suited but just barely. I cannot recommend and will not return.,N/A
Charles River Inn,Osung,South Korea,1 review,October 9  2017,7.1,Boston is a really pricy placer to stayI recommend to bring your own PCP items since the amenities were not that great,Spacious parking spaces!There were many stores nearby including McDonald's. IHOP. Staples. Target ...
Charles River Inn,Salvatore,United States of America,1 review,October 8  2017,3.8,I couldn't keep my curtains open...my view was a huge dumpster that was so overflowed that I could barely see the street. I walked from the bed to the bathroom barefoot and the bottom of my feet looked like they were painted black. They were remodelling the room next door and all day the crew were playing loud music non stop. My electronic key/card just stopped working.  The tv remote was gross... cob webs on the ceiling and that's what a $180 per night got me. Zero up keep on the landscaping....again gross.,Good wifi
Charles River Inn,Gregory,United States of America,1 review,October 7  2017,3.8,The place is in serious need of renovation!!! The first red flag is that  the old days inn sign remains. on the property.  The first room we were given was just old and it smelled old. The second room was not much better. The basin was cracked and the anti slip pads in the tub were dirty.  Didn't take a shower. didn't stay long and wont be back. Good location though.,location was good
Charles River Inn,Wendy,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 6  2017,3.3,Such filthy beds. stains. hairs... so vile we wrapped ourselves in towels and "slept" on top of the bedding. And we travel all over the world. not fussy. Gross. Ruined the weekend.,N/A
Charles River Inn,Anonymous,France,3 Reviews,October 6  2017,7.1,Breakfast is free but the choice is quite limited. The location feels a bit like in the middle of nowhere. although there is a McDonald's and an iHop on either side of the hotel. However with a car it's easy to get into Boston/Cambridge. etc.,The hotel is actually more like a motel. The decor is a bit "tired" but rooms were being refurbished while we were there. so apparently they are going to modernize. The rooms are really huge and comfortable. with an old New England style. There are washers/dryers that you can use. The staff were friendly. Parking is free. The best part is the price. much more affordable than staying right in the city. If you want modern/luxurious. this is not the place for you. but the motel has its charm and I would recommend it for people looking to economize on lodging in the Boston area (as long as you have a car).
Charles River Inn,Christopher,United States of America,1 review,October 4  2017,5.0,The fridge sounds as if it's a ticking time bomb ready to blow at any moment. The TV has about 10 working channels. 6 of which are news. The AC refuses to stay on. To top it all off. the entire hotel smells of piss. but the rooms smell of fermented piss. The staff is really nice though.,Check in was easy enough.
Charles River Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 2  2017,3.8,Upon arrival. the room I was assigned did not have an operational air conditioner. so I was moved to another room. The next day I went out and upon arrival. my door card did not work. After two trips to the front desk and a suggestion to use another card they got one to work. The following day I get a call as I'm parking for the Sox game that it showed in their system I was supposed to have checked out. which was not accurate. I left. after paying $50 for parking to go back to hotel to manage the situation. Once determined. with my receipts. that I was to check out the next day. I missed the first two innings of the baseball game. which was the reason for the trip. The desk clerk said he would talk to his manager. Then upon my arrival. again. my door card did not work. With arms loaded with belongings. I had to walk again back down the stairs to get an operable card. And the desk clerk that said he would talk to the manager was not around to discuss the outcome.  The hotel is outdated and run down. Dirty carpet in hotel and room amongst other unfinished projects.,The bed linens were clean.
Charles River Inn,Matt,United States of America,1 review,October 2  2017,2.5,We paid for two beds in a room as we're not a couple. When we got there they gave our room away so we had to put up with a room with a bed and fold out sofa. He said the rooms been refurbished and it definitely wasn't haha.. They didn't provide sheets for the sofa bed. prison beds were more comfier than this. When wanting to speak with the manager. he wasn't in they've took my email address and have not bothered getting back in touch with me. On top of this the walls are thinner than a one ply toilet roll and the noise during the night of doors slamming from other rooms was painful.,There was an exit to the car park where you can park.
Charles River Inn,VP dxb,United Arab Emirates,5 Reviews,October 2  2017,2.9,Firstly the hotel has no signage been lit in night and has different name so it's confusing. The Rooms where not cleaned the next day! The guys at reception keep saying report to Management! The carpet smells of Glue!,N/A
Charles River Inn,Nancy,United States of America,1 review,September 29  2017,5.4,The name is misleading; it's a Days Inn. and in need of updating.  The lobby is shabby. and hot.  Our room was hot. a/c not turned on. the bathroom was old. dirty-looking. and the sink faucet leaked.  It took awhile for the a/c to make the room comfortable.,The bed was comfortable.
Charles River Inn,John,United States of America,1 review,September 29  2017,4.2,Spend some extra money to stay closer to the city (Backbay). Hotel is an old  days inn and is sketchy. Not very good local food/amenities choices within walking distance. Some Uber drivers had a tough time getting to the hotel (Boston roads are very confusing). Staff didn't speak English well. Shower leaked all night. Walls are thin. Room had damages to the walls. Whoever is running the place is just trying to squeeze every last penny out of it. without investing any money.,I thought I liked the cost. But I probably spent the same for all the Uber's to and from the hotel. I walked everywhere in the city. Only used Uber to get to the hotel.
Charles River Inn,Disgusted,United States of America,1 review,September 25  2017,3.3,Stains on the walls and doors (some could even be washed off...they justnever did?). broken entry door to our room. gum set in rug. bird poop oncurtains (or other foreign stain?). ripped lamp shade. dirty tub. blackmold around sink. white mold on rug near air conditioner. duck tapeholding air conditioner together (also covered in rust). broken dresserdrawers and let's not talk about the smell!,Absolutely nothing. I wouldn't send anyone here. It was in horrible.filthy. condition. If I didn't get in so late. I would have movedimmediately to another hotel. This hotel is really a Days Inn. with atwo star rating! I was told it was the "Charles River Inn"with four star rating! ??? Now I would never trust Bookings.com again
Charles River Inn,Selwyn,United States of America,1 review,September 21  2017,2.5,Everything!!!,The woman at the front desk was rude. My family and I booked two rooms. Only one was ready when we got there. Each room was over $400 for 3 night.one of the rooms was disgusting. Smell like death and cigarettes. I will never bring my family back to this place..I should of listen to the reviews and say far far away from this place... P.S the breakfast was a JOKE!! Could keep going on. But you get the point. I hope.
Charles River Inn,Jadon,United States of America,1 review,September 15  2017,8.3,The rooms have minimum lighting. the bathroom was rather small. for the money it's a good deal.,The bed was comfy. and the pull out bed was long enough to fit my needs. The A/C worked perfectly.
Charles River Inn,Maureen,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 15  2017,6.7,it was just old.  one day the maid service didn't come by.,in fairness we did not go to the free breakfast so can't comment.it was a convenient location to get to outlying areas.  pike and storrow drive were close by.
Charles River Inn,Anonymous,Taiwan,1 review,September 13  2017,5.8,The overall environment is not so clean.,I heard it's very simple so I didn't try. I Just went to IHOP for breakfast. Mcdonald's &amp; Starbuck are also very close. Super convenience.
Charles River Inn,David,United States of America,7 Reviews,September 13  2017,7.5,The motel could use a remodel!,The staff is very accommodating---I was booked into a 2nd floor room and the clerk graciously gave me a first floor room since I had quite a few bags of luggage and there is no elevator.
Charles River Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 9  2017,7.1,Upon arrival I was given an incorrect key to my room and therefore was moved for some reason? Then about 10 minutes into being in that room they called to ask me to switch back to the original room because they sorted out the key issue. which was irksome but pretty mild. The door ended up only being able to stay shut via deadbolt. the latch lock inside and the regular handle lock were basically for show. which was a little off putting but for me the room was really just for sleeping and clothing storage. The toilet seat was broken and would not stay in place.,Cleaning staff were on point. half an hour walk to the green line saved me a lot of money in travel costs. Starbucks next door for a morning kick and IHOP being one of my favorites makes the location pretty good value.
Charles River Inn,Robert,United States of America,1 review,September 8  2017,9.6,They need to update their sign. You can still see the old Days Inn sign. Bigger breakfast selection.,Closeness to where we were going. Staff was friendly. made check in and check out easy. Property looked great from the outside.
Charles River Inn,John,United States of America,1 review,September 8  2017,7.9,The hotel needs some maintenance.  Doors in the room were hard to open and close.  Nothing was broken. but the place could use some sprucing up.  Breakfast was acceptable. but below average in variety.,It is the only motel in the area I wanted. so the location was ideal.  It was reasonably priced for Boston. and the room was comfortable.  The motel is small. so all rooms are easily accessible from parking.
Charles River Inn,Daniela,United States of America,1 review,September 6  2017,7.5,You have to update your room key everyday. otherwise it would not work. We stayed 7 nights and we had to update the key every day. so did all other guests.,Free breakfast and free parking. Room was clean.
Charles River Inn,Lorena,United States of America,7 Reviews,September 5  2017,6.3,The bathroom was dirty. I went to take a shower and there was hair (not my hair) on the walls and the tub floor. Also our key wouldn't work. We had to keep asking for assistance. You can also hear every single thing through the walls.,It was easy to check-in and the beds were a good size.
Charles River Inn,Denise,United States of America,1 review,September 4  2017,7.1,Staff attitude. no elevator. rooms in the front of building have a lot of street noise at night. Toilet broken upon arrival. This hotel is in dire need of a facelift. Signage does not reflect the name of the hotel. Outside sign says Days Inn.,Location. free parking. price
Charles River Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 4  2017,2.5,Too expensive for a piece of crap like that in the middle of nowhere. Almost unreachable for a pedestrian other than walking on the side of the road.,Nothing
Charles River Inn,Stephanie,Canada,1 review,September 1  2017,6.3,The carpets looked hard used.,I was in a bind for last minute accommodations. I saw very mixed reviews on the inn. The most important thing to me was cleanliness. I was pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness. Although the carpets looked in need of a steam clean. the linens were fresh and the room was clean. Lots of space in the room.
Charles River Inn,Lorena,United States of America,1 review,September 1  2017,6.3,The room when we first check in has lots of fruit flies. but when the airconditioning was turn on the flies just vanished. Also the faucet in the bathroom is leaking. The management should fixed it. because it's a waste of water.,The bed is good and clean.
Charles River Inn,Ron,Netherlands,10 Reviews,August 27  2017,4.2,Room had an odd stuffy smell. Room is rather basic. while not being a particularly cheap motel. They could not find us on their booking list (!). however they still offered a room for the same price as ordered via booking.com,The motel is a 20 minute drive from Logan airport.
Charles River Inn,Brad,Canada,1 review,August 23  2017,8.8,The room keys did not always work.,The staff were very helpful as far as how to access public transport. They gave us two options. take the bus (near the hotel) to Central and get on the Train. or drive to Alewife in our car. park at garage and get on the T.  We chose the latter and it worked out awesome for us. The only issue we had was the keys did not work after they were programmed. Other than that. there's an IHOP And McDonald's on either side which was nice.
Charles River Inn,Diana,United States of America,1 review,August 23  2017,7.9,Door looked like it was kicked in by the cops @ a drug raid... Air conditioner filter was very dirty. And the tub control needed a screw and the switch from tub to shower was partially broken.. Damn I could get a as maintenance man!,Room lites were very nice.. Especially the reading lite
Charles River Inn,Patrycja,United States of America,4 Reviews,August 23  2017,7.5,Ain't easy to get somewhere without a car (although parkings in Boston costs like 40$ for longer than 3h. so I recommend to get some app to find a cheaper deal for parking; paid 20$ for whole day) unless you willing to walk like a mile or two to train or bus station,good wifi. IHOP and my Donald's next to the hotel. free breakfast but only til 9:30
Charles River Inn,Luthais,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,August 22  2017,6.3,Thought the staff could of been more welcoming and friendly seemed a little off and not interested in making the stay that little bit better.,The bed was lovely. super comfy and it was huge.
Charles River Inn,jordantps,United States of America,10 Reviews,August 22  2017,5.4,Wi-fi is terrible and unstable.  Free breakfast is offered at the bare minimum list of items. in a small room. with a sticky floor.  Property has no elevator. and there is no warning at Booking.com about it. so guests with walking issues can be alerted to ask for ground floor rooms.,There is plenty of parking.  McDonald`s and IHOP are at a short walking distance.  Check-in and check-out are fast and effective.  Despite being between two busy city roads. rooms were relatively quiet.
Charles River Inn,Savta,United States of America,1 review,August 17  2017,9.2,We were disappointed in housekeeping. Our sheets were not changed. and we were there for 3 nights.,The room was large and comfortable. Location was close to everything in the center of town. We were 10 minutes away from Brookline. where we were able to dine in kosher restaurants and meet family. Breakfast was free and sufficient.
Charles River Inn,Janet,United States of America,1 review,August 15  2017,6.3,Dirty!!!!! Sticky black stain on floor in room. I had to put paper on it. toilet was loud. room was not can in corners and there was a hair in shower when I walked ib. Ew.,Location. Helpful staff.

Charles River Inn,sercansengun,United States of America,4 Reviews,August 9  2017,7.9,Busy roads on both sides of the building. so may be a bit noisy during the night for light sleepers. The cleanliness is acceptable but not top notch.,Just next to 24-hours open restaurants which is very convenient. Big rooms and friendly staff. Easy to access with public transport (bus).
Charles River Inn,Kirsten,United States of America,1 review,August 9  2017,6.7,There was a smell like something had died in the refrigerator it was awful. And the distance that the ad said it was from the hote to House or Blues was wrong--by like 3 miles.,The price was good and the overall comfort
Charles River Inn,Anonymous,India,2 Reviews,August 8  2017,6.7,It was in outer region of Boson. and bus service to the place has really low frequency. like once in an hour. This made accessing the place very difficult.,N/A
Charles River Inn,Jarvichi,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,August 8  2017,5.8,Hotel really needs updating. you get what you pay for here. the room wasn't aweful. but there was a general griminess to the place. Other reviews talked about the place being infested with mice. being used as a homeless hostel. a crack house and even a brothel... we didn't see any of these things. Mice tend to be a winter problem in my experience. they'll go wherever is dry. warm and there is food.The location of the hotel really requires that you drive to get into the city where parking can cost $40+ a day. Our best solution to this problem was to drive and park at Alewife station which costs $7 a day to park. buying a $22 7 day metro pass to get around the city.,Easy to park.Cheap. compared to other Boston hotels.
Charles River Inn,Jason,Canada,1 review,August 7  2017,8.3,Once we went in. firstly I felt a little of decayed and moisture smell. but after I open the air condition to dry the air. it is good.,The location. the parking. the free in hotel.
Charles River Inn,Lilian,United States of America,1 review,August 7  2017,10,N/A,To be our first time in Boston. the staff was very accurate and they assisted us at any moment. By even giving us directions of how to get at the hotel by public transportation in different days and situations. they were always helpful. Our room was excellent just for what we need it for. I was happy to be there and I would for sure come back to this hotel.
Charles River Inn,E_FENTY,United Kingdom,30 Reviews,August 5  2017,8.3,Reaching local transportation is a little awkward although it is close.,Nice and Simple. Friendly. actually very friendly. very helpful and clean. My room was plenty big enough for just me and the simple decor was well presented and CLEAN. Bathroom was just how I like them. read that as a nice shower with plenty of hot water all say long. Room had fridge and microwave and controllable A/C.The area is not central although there is a Mc D next door. The main area is a 30min bus ride away. Getting to the bus stop means crossing a pedestrian UNFRIENDLY highway - so no bags. pushchairs or slow runners.. I could not find a safer place to cross so be very aware of the fast traffic. The bus ride is $2 - no change given but once in the centre. get yourself a CHARLIE CARD for the basic $11 or you can put more on the card. Use your credit or debit card and note. as with many places that use cards. no signature or pin number is required so keep your cards extra safe.. and when paying by card. always keep the card within your eyesight - do not let cashiers take your card away. insist on going to the machine or having it brought to you..common sense really.Do note that there is a highway behind the hotel and a train line but this is not really an issue BUT there is also a highway to the front of the building and during the day is noisy but at night is no issueThe main centre is called CENTRAL. from here you can catch a metro train to SOUTH STATION where you can get AMTRAK trains and many other things.. you will need the INBOUND TRAIN for this heading towards BRAINTREE.Hope this review makes your life easier.. I totally enjoyed m stay here.August 2017.
Charles River Inn,Anne,United States of America,1 review,August 5  2017,2.9,Very limited breakfast bar..young woman at the night desk was very unfriendly....bathroom was marginal....definitely not worth money we paid for the room,Bedding was clean...location was near our activities
Charles River Inn,French Mike,United States of America,6 Reviews,August 3  2017,2.9,Old shabby dirty in disrepair...$200 Per night for such a dump... Takeit off your listing. It still sporting a days in sign although they lostthat franchise a long time ago. Never Again...,There is nothing to like.
Charles River Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 3  2017,7.1,The facilities were dated and worn. The room was a bit musty- but nothing unbearable.  Needs some updating and TLC,The motel was a quick Uber ride away from Fenway (which was the purpose of our trip). Breakfast was more than I expected. cereal. bagels. muffins. OJ etc!
Charles River Inn,Barbara,United States of America,1 review,July 29  2017,7.9,Fire alarm went off in the middle of the night although no fire ??? Perhaps batteries malfunctioned. The outside sine says: "Days Inn" - misleading,Proximity to Boston attractionsFree breakfast Price
Charles River Inn,Simon,United Kingdom,9 Reviews,July 29  2017,8.3,Not much space to eat breakfast. so has to be taken to roomDecor a little jaded especially in reception area though room was absolutely fineFair distance from nearest subway to get into downtown Boston,Friendly and helpful staffRoom sizeBreakfast not bad for complimentary
Charles River Inn,Tryandfeelme,United States of America,1 review,July 29  2017,5.0,The fact it had only one vending machine on each floor. The soda machine was out of water for a week.no pool. the cable sucked. and for what we paid the tv was so small. The beds for a 3 adult 1 Child booking was small.,I liked house keeping.  they were nice and considerate.
Charles River Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 28  2017,6.3,Bathroom had no vent fan. Bathroom door didn't shut completely. Base board heating was missing pieces.,Location and price met my needs for this trip.
Charles River Inn,Aisling Maxwell,United States of America,13 Reviews,July 19  2017,8.8,Have to get an lift or uber to places but still worth price ..small ride away to subway.,Clean room . large room had good tv . everything we needed for an outstanding price compared to prices in boston .!
Charles River Inn,Cynthia,United States of America,1 review,July 17  2017,3.8,This property is very run down with peeling wall paper. old dirty rugs. mushy mattresses. the counter in our bathroom was gross. brown stains. linens/bed spreads dreary and old.  The tiles n the corners of the bathroom dirty/stained. This property is in desperate need of. at the very least. a complete soft good renovation and a good. disinfecting cleaning job.  Had there been another place available I would have left.  And I am not happy that I paid $166. for less than mediocre motel.,Convenient Parking.
Charles River Inn,Ivan,Russia,6 Reviews,July 16  2017,6.3,Well. I know it's a cheap hotel. However. the property condition is poor. A breakfast is just flakes/milk/bread. butter/coffee. and the area for breakfast is very small.The main disappointment was absence of a blanket for the sofa bed. I booked room with 1 queen bed and a sofa bed. for 3 guests. However. the sofa bed had only 1 sheet on it; I asked for a blanket - a staff person was able to find just a blanket but w/o a second sheet. Conclusion - hotel staff does not know where things are stored and is not attentive to what is booked and how many quests are in the room.,When booking. I was looking for a cheap hotel in Boston to sleep 1 night after the flight. before driving further. This hotel met this requirement - cheap enough. room for 3. with free parking.IHOP and McDonalds in 2 min walk each were a simple and cheap choice to eat.
Charles River Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 14  2017,4.2,Overall. for the price I expect more--granted Boston is an expensive city. They key card took multiple times before working; the lights by the bed didn't work until I moved the bed to find the plug had slipped from the wall; the clock by the bed never worked; the carpet was stained in several places; there was a white drip stain on the bed skirt (picture attached); the buttons on the air conditioner were cracked and required at least four hard pushes before they would change the fan (to high. medium. or low) or temperature; the light in the bathroom was cracked; and perhaps most frustratingly reception assured me I had ABC several times after I asked which channel it was. but every time I went to the channel I was told. it was black and white static. There were actually something like 15 working channels. For breakfast. the bagels were hard but edible after toasting. and juice was out of order. All the pieces of a decent hotel were there. but most things didn't meet the most basic of standards--especially for a $150+ per night. I've had much better experiences at Motel 6's.,The staff was very friendly at check in and check out. Wifi worked very well. and the sheets and shower were clean. I appreciated that there was a breakfast though it was nothing to get excited about.
Charles River Inn,David,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,July 13  2017,4.6,Air Con was broken.No hot water available at breakfast because there was an issue with the machine as we were told.My wife had to go to Mac Donalds next door each morning to get a cup of tea.Extremely poor location for exploring Boston. the taxi fare was approx $24 each way,The staff were very friendly and helpful.
Charles River Inn,George,Kazakhstan,3 Reviews,June 30  2017,5.0,The hotel was clearly past its prime -- just old and dingy. with the paint peeling from the walls. that kind of thing.  I wouldn't have minded it at all as a bachelor. traveling on a budget. might even have called it "authentic."  But traveling with a family ... well. my wife accuses me of booking on the cheap. and what can I say? -- she's right.   On the plus side. the beds were sufficiently comfortable and the shower worked fine.  It wasn't a warm day. so it didn't matter that the air conditioner was busted. ...,It was cheap. or actually at $150+ a night not cheap -- but reasonable.  Prices elsewhere in Boston are OUTRAGEOUS.  The location off the Mass Pike is good. though it helps to spot the hotel from the highway.  We missed it and as a consequence took the right exit but still wandered through Allston for 30 minutes looking for it.  (Of course. not a problem if you've got GPS).
Charming 2 Bedroom Apartment by the Green Line with Private Parking,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 23  2017,10,WiFi password didn't work. but because we were only staying 1 night. it wasn't a big issue.,Clean. comfortable. The owners provided very good details and instructions about the property. The building for this apartment seemed to be under a lot of renovation. but once inside the unit itself. it was nice.
Copley Square Hotel,Irene,United Kingdom,11 Reviews,October 28  2017,9.6,N/A,Location was perfect to see Boston. Close to the Common and the Prudential Tower and the river. They did a wine tasting session every evening which was lovely after a busy day site seeing and a great opportunity to chat to others guests.
Copley Square Hotel,Peter,Australia,31 Reviews,October 26  2017,7.9,Room and bed were a bit small. not much room if you had a bit of luggage. Would be good if at least a continental breakfast was included.,Clean. modern. good location. trendy.
Copley Square Hotel,Victoria,United Kingdom,9 Reviews,October 25  2017,7.9,Expensive compared to our other accommodation including a comparative hotel in Manhattan. Breakfast in hotel was expensive.No free tea/coffee available. Again all other accommodation offered this.It was my birthday when we stayed here and a nice touch would have been recognition of this as part of good customer service.,Helpful staff when dropping luggage off by rental car and needing to park up outside the front of the hotel for a short while.Free wine between 5pm and 6pm.
Copley Square Hotel,Wellingtonius,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 21  2017,9.2,The exhaust fan in the shower wasn't working so we had to shower with the bathroom door open to keep the steam circulating away.,We got there and they were serving complimentary wine (yes. please!). They upgraded us from a queen boutique to a king. so that was a nice touch. too. We really liked the amenities and the room. Someone said that the bed was amazing. well. I think we like ours better than this one. but definitely we slept really well. All in all. we enjoyed our stay. We were looking for a somewhat fancier place since this was a combined birthday gift for my husband and I so we didn't mind splurging. In other circumstances and had we been spending more than one night in Boston. I don't know that I would have chosen the Copley. But like I said. we were treating ourselves. So mind that.
Copley Square Hotel,Teresa,United States of America,1 review,October 15  2017,7.1,Our room was tiny and did not have a refrigerator or coffee maker in the room. You had to go to the lobby for coffee.  It is an old building so the heat is controlled from outside and our room got to 86 degrees two nights. Also there is a nightclub connected to the hotel. Be prepared for loud wall shaking music til about 2 a.m.,The location was great. Staff was always friendly and helped with any questions. They have complimentary wine in the evening.
Copley Square Hotel,Rebecca,United Kingdom,9 Reviews,October 14  2017,5.4,I expected more in the way of facilities - there was no fridge in the room. and we needed one. the bottled water was advertised in the room at 5 dollars a bottle. The towels were so small you couldn't wear them and stay decent. The place was tired and tatty - the rooms smelt damp and musty. the leather headboards were peeling. our room was on a slight slant which was bizarre,The location was brilliant for exploring Boston on foot.
Copley Square Hotel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,22 Reviews,October 8  2017,8.8,Room very small.  Breakfast was very limited but we just wanted toast so it was OK.  No tea/coffee in the room,Staff were really helpful.  Bed was very comfortable.  Free wine at 5pm every evening.

Copley Square Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 26  2017,7.1,I was very disappointed in the size of the room.  It was like a closet.  I did take advantage of the special. but I never thought I'd get half a room by paying half the price.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price. but if I did I would have requested a different room!,The location and the hotel in general was very nice.  Staff very nice/
Copley Square Hotel,Lori,Canada,1 review,September 25  2017,9.6,The bathroom could have been bigger. the price was too high. our daughter's room was more than ours and I booked at the same time. and they could hear the booming of music from the lounge.,Location was great. beds were comfy. staff was friendly. the happy hour. our room was quiet.
Copley Square Hotel,Chris,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,September 21  2017,7.5,The 7th floor room we stayed in was similar to the one we had in 2000. quite small.When we had our luggage in the room it was rather cramped.,The location of the hotel . this was our second visit within this holiday. we stayed for 4 nights before the cruise. must say the room on the 5th floor(1 night) was superior to the 7th floor room(4 nights).That said. the staff are attentive. the reception staff well informed and took time to ensure we had all the options.
Copley Square Hotel,Sally,New Zealand,5 Reviews,September 21  2017,10,Lifts were slow but to be expected in a building of this age.,Great location with restaurants and bars within easy walking distance.  Quiet hotel in an old building which has been very well refurbished.  Good size comfortable room.   Trolley and duck tours leave from just down the road.  Bar was very quiet. in fact seemed to be closed altogether some evenings?  Complimentary coffee in the lobby in the mornings was much appreciated.

Copley Square Hotel,Kimberly,United States of America,1 review,September 15  2017,9.6,Valet was a little pricey but the staff is so friendly and helpful.,The staff were all extremely friendly. the hotel is very clean and trendy. The value for the hotel was good I'm just being picky and wanted complimentary breakfast ğŸ˜‚ but it was a great price compared to other hotels. My sister needed to print something and they were very accommodating and told her she could use the iPad's at the front desk and print off of them. Was like a 15min walk to Fenway. grocery store is right on the corner next to the hotel so convenient. Would definitely stay here again.
Copley Square Hotel,Sarah,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,September 13  2017,9.2,Some of the accommodation could be a little updated. Though recently painted. some of the woodwork etc. is showing its age! I liked the breakfast restaurant.,Location. value for money. and cleanliness

Copley Square Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,34 Reviews,September 7  2017,7.5,Rooms are a bit small.,The location of this property is brilliant. It is right next to the mall. and walking distance to plenty of restaurants and cafes. I appreciate there are stairs on the interior of the property that connects all of the floors and it's essentially part of the decor. Wifi is stable. which is great for business travelers.
Copley Square Hotel,Teresa,Spain,4 Reviews,September 6  2017,7.5,The room wasn't prepared for 4 persons (parents and 2 children).

Copley Square Hotel,MoniqueZ,United States of America,8 Reviews,September 5  2017,9.6,Perhaps the smallest bathroom I've ever experienced in a hotel. I'm guessing because it was a historic hotel? Lovely finishes. just no way 2 people can get ready at the same time.,Welcoming staff. excellent location. and nice amenities rounded out our stay. Wine served from 5-6 pm in the lobby. where we got a couple of thoughtful restaurant recommendations - our dinner was perfect. Breakfast in lobby restaurant was lovely. too. We would definitely stay here again if in the area.
Copley Square Hotel,Sophie,Australia,6 Reviews,September 2  2017,5.4,I had read the reviews and was pretty excited to stay. however the room was tiny and bathroom extremely under whelming. It felt like a small box and I was pretty disappointed to say the least. The staff on the front desk seemed worn out. Great location but for my first stay in Boston I wish I had stayed somewhere else for that price.,Great location.
Copley Square Hotel,Caitriona,Ireland,7 Reviews,August 26  2017,6.3,The cleanliness of the rooms left a lot to be desired. The rooms are very small &amp; in need of a good face lift. They are used &amp; tired looking.,Location is excellent Staff are very friendly &amp; helpful.

Copley Square Hotel,New Hokies,United States of America,14 Reviews,August 15  2017,8.8,Many hotels are going to a WiFi approach where I have to login multiple times a day (on multiple devices).  It's a real hassle and my company laptop doesn't always work this way.  It would be better to login once during your stay on each device (or just provide free WiFi).,The hotel location is great.  There are many niche restaurants in walking distance.  The hotel is beautiful and the room was small but comfortable.  It was nice having free coffee in the morning.  If I were a wine drinker. the free wine bar in the early evening would be good. too.  All the staff were friendly and helpful.
Copley Square Hotel,Carol,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 15  2017,9.6,I don't know. Everything was fine!,The location of the hotel is ideal and a good jumping off point for Boston activities.

Copley Square Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 14  2017,5.8,Our room was not available at 3:00.  and then we were put in a handicap room for 3 nights which was unfortunate.  In the bathroom there was no place to put any personal items.  No room on the sink. or even a small shelf.  There was a small metal stand with 3 glass shelves 1 foot X 1 foot.  which held two extra towels.  We put those on the dresser so we could at least have a small shaving kit and toothbrushes in the bathroom.  AND the two drinking glasses were located near the floor every day on the same paper doilies.  on a worn metal tray on the bottom shelf of the bedside stand.  (How could someone in a wheelchair even reach them down by the floor!).,The hotel staff and the restaurant.

Copley Square Hotel,Cheryl,United States of America,5 Reviews,August 1  2017,5.8,The price! When I book the room I thought parking and breakfast was included in the price. And they were not.

Copley Square Hotel,Bruce,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 11  2017,9.6,N/A,This is a modern style hotel with its history showing through.  Rooms are cozy.  Bed was super comfortable.  Modern style. new. clean bathroom.  The hotel is a in great location in Back Bay.  This is a cool part of town.   We enjoyed being able to walk to the North End during the day and then come back to Back Bay later in the evening.The part we like best about the hotel is its location.  From the hotel you can walk to Boston Public Garden. which is just a 15-minute walk away. through the park and on to the North End. which is a 30-minute walk from the hotel.  Then walk the Freedom trail. hang out on a rooftop bar in late afternoon. eat an excellent Italian dinner. and then have fun listening to live music in a couple of old taverns.  On the walk back to the Copley swing by the Cheers bar and then walk through the chic. stately neighborhoods around Boyleston and Newbury Streets back to the hotel.
Copley Square Hotel,Lorraine,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,June 9  2017,9.6,No tea / coffee making facility in the room. No room service after 10pm and no one could make us a drink when we came in at night. Only drinks from the bar.,Decor and smell.....very clean and fresh.
Copley Square Hotel,Ian,Australia,4 Reviews,June 4  2017,6.3,Phoned the desk for a pot of tea at 2.00pm. Girl said the security man would bring it to our room. By 3.00pm it had not arrived. Lodged complaint when we checked out and was told the manager would contact me. I am still waiting.,N/A
Copley Square Hotel,Paul,United States of America,1 review,June 1  2017,6.7,Bathroom was ridiculously small.  Sheets smelled and room was damp and musty.  Basically just old. There was no place for snacks or late night munchies. Plenty of more modern and fresher hotels nearby. When the hotel remodels it may be worth visiting again.  But I didn't enjoy my stay.,Staff was very friendly.  Location excellent.
Copley Square Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,May 31  2017,7.1,No fridge or coffee maker.  Limited amenities like continental breakfast. afternoon snacks. expanded coffee tea bar all day.,Bed and room quality. Quiet.
Copley Square Hotel,Gloria,United States of America,4 Reviews,May 23  2017,8.8,Arrived Friday evening.  At around 11pm. had to change rooms due to loud pulsating music from bar downstairs.  King-size bed not available.  We did receive a discount for the non-availability of king size bed for the room that we moved to.  We thus had to change rooms again for the 2nd night.  Staff very accommodating though.  The information in the room indicated that the restaurant and room-service would be open for breakfast until 11 am.   I went to breakfast at 10:50am. to be told that the restaurant closed at 10:30am. Left for airport hungry.,Staff very accommodating and helpful.
Copley Square Hotel,James,United States of America,3 Reviews,May 21  2017,9.6,Not a matter of dislike. but would suggest installing grab bars in the bathtubs if the tub sides are all are as high as the one we had in our room.,The hotel is just a block away from  Boylston St.. which has everything you could want in the way of restaurants or shopping. Centrally located about half way between Boston Common and Fenway so a nice walk in either direction.
Copley Square Hotel,Cynthia,United States of America,1 review,May 17  2017,9.2,No coffee maker in room.,The location of this hotel was perfect for us.  I had no idea the hotel was walking distance to Fenway.  We arrived at noon to check in luggage so we could go to a 1:35pm Red Sox game.  I called desk day before letting them know our early arrival.  When we arrived they had our room ready.  Great customer service!  Easy access to the T.  Airport shuttle a block away.
Copley Square Hotel,Andrew,Isle of Man,17 Reviews,May 15  2017,8.3,The lack of a full service restaurant in the evening is a deficiency - the bar meal menu and room were poor. There are many good restaurants nearby but you do not always want to go out looking for one. especially on arrival from a long-haul flight. Also there are no coffee or tea-making facilities in the room. The shower was good but the bath-shaped base was too shallow to have a really good bath.,This is quite a small hotel with a lot of character - we liked the place!. It claims to be the second oldest hotel in Boston but the decor is a modern retro design. One of the staff told me that there used to be a nightclub in the basement and people like Ella Fitzgerald used to perform there - since she is one of my favourite singers the hotel immediately shot up in my estimation! Sadly. there is no nightclub there now. only the usual. very loud. disco music in the bar. The hotel is well situated in the Back Bay district. very close to the Hop on - Hop off bus route. though you have to go to the Marriott hotel across the road to buy tickets. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. and the doormen always made us feel welcome.
Copley Square Hotel,Jane,United States of America,4 Reviews,May 14  2017,9.2,Not a thing.,Staff extra helpful and friendly. free coffee in the morning and wine at happy hour. Perfect location for catching a Red Sox game and visiting the fine arts museum.
Copley Square Hotel,Marion,Spain,42 Reviews,May 9  2017,8.8,The bathroom was incredibly small.  Room for one person only and not comfortably.,The location and personal were both excellent at this hotel.  Free bottled water and black out shades in the room.  Free coffee and tea every morning in the lobby.
Copley Square Hotel,John,United States of America,3 Reviews,May 5  2017,9.2,Pricey for what we got. Restaurant is only for breakfast. No minibar. Bar opens only at 5PM. Small reception area. For $400/day not worth it.,Great ambience. Staff excellent. Room very comfortable
Copley Square Hotel,Frank,United States of America,1 review,May 4  2017,8.8,Bathroom was extremely small. no refrigerator or microwave in rooms I was able to obtain a refrigerator that was accommodating but no microwave and tea and coffee should be offered 24/7,Location and wine offered at 5 pm.  Excellent tv selection
Copley Square Hotel,Bill Show,United States of America,1 review,April 17  2017,7.5,The Exhale breakfast was awful. Under cooked over easy eggs? Then my guest waited half hour for scrambled eggs. Very pricey hotel. Do people really like the bland music piped into the lobby in the mornings?,. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. They are probably the best part of the stay. The morning coffee was a nice touch as was the intelligent newspapers. The Bed was very comfortable as well. Loved the mini bar off the lobby.
Copley Square Hotel,Ap,France,3 Reviews,April 13  2017,10,Bathroom was one of the smaller ones I have had there but can't complain really for the price.,This is a smaller. more intimate hotel which I prefer to the big chains. Exceptional pancakes and the evening wine tasting was a nice touch.  Also free water. coffee and granola bars in the morning which compensates for lack of coffee maker in room. Very friendly and helpful staff.
Copley Square Hotel,Amanda,United States of America,1 review,April 9  2017,9.2,The bathroom is really small along with the room it's self.  I  didn't have the best experience in the bar either.  The bar tenders where too busy socializing and just plain ignoring me.  It was very unprofessional.,Great place to stay for Anime Boston. super clean. friendly staff.
Copley Square Hotel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,March 22  2017,6.3,We paid approximately $350 for one night's stay and this did not include a breakfast. The bathroom was small also. Did not feel that it was value for money.,It was clean and comfortable. Check-in/out was quick.
Copley Square Hotel,Yue,China,4 Reviews,March 19  2017,7.9,The air condition is not working properly in the first room and the staff helped us to change to another. However. it still stopped halfway through the night!,Excellent location.
Copley Square Hotel,Eileen,Australia,1 review,March 12  2017,10,N/A,The complimentary tea and coffee in the morning. hot chocolate in the afternoon especially in the cold weather and the wine pour from 5-6pm were lovely touches. Close to the prudential center and public transport.
Copley Square Hotel,Christine,Denmark,24 Reviews,February 25  2017,9.6,No restaurant in evening. Bar very crowded in the evening.,Nice Hotel. Good lokation. Exercise room perfect. Very good service in the lobby with free coffee.

They went the extra step!!!Location was great as well.Will definitely stay there again....
Copley Square Hotel,Deborah,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,February 21  2017,5.0,Initial room given to us was like sleeping in a "boiler room"!!! Very noisy all night so didn't sleep. hence request to move. Creaky floorboards above room meant every step of guest above could be heard. No coffee making facilities or fridge in room. We were not told on arrival of free coffee/ tea. hot chocolate etc available at various times in lobby. Unable to buy and collect food from restaurant- room service only!! Lifts were sooooo slow and cranky. Lobby/ guest area very very small and uncomfortable. Would describe as a "boutique"/ corporate hotel- NOT ideal for families.,Bed and room. after asking to be moved were spacious and comfortable.
Copley Square Hotel,Anna,Italy,15 Reviews,February 9  2017,7.5,Bathroom was quite narrow and shower jet was not adjustable,Position was strategic. very close to Copley subway station. which is ser ed by all the Green line branches. It was the cheapest one in that close area
Copley Square Hotel,Anonymous,Ireland,1 review,January 31  2017,10,N/A,Staff was friendly and welcoming. Room was lovely and neat. Housekeeping was excellent.  Morning coffee and tea in the lounge made it a nice place to begin the workday.

Copley Square Hotel,Gc,United States of America,8 Reviews,January 29  2017,6.7,Room was garish in terms of decor. Several items were in disrepair--iron. headboard. room heater.  Elevator is painfully slow. Adjacent bar staff was profane and unprofessional. Room heater loudly turned on and off all night.,Location is great--a block from the T. felt safe walking even in the dark. Staff is friendly and responsive. Towels were clean and soft.
Copley Square Hotel,Melanie,Singapore,20 Reviews,January 24  2017,8.8,No tea and coffee in the room. A strange thing for an otherwise nice hotel. The tea and coffee available in reception. for limited hours in the morning. is no replacement for the expected standard of tea in the room. (I did not enjoy having to get dressed and go downstairs to get my morning cuppa!),Very friendly front desk staff and doormen. Good price for the location.

Boston Little Italy Two Bedrooms (H2D),Jennifer,United States of America,3 Reviews,November 1  2017,6.7,The bathroom was really dirty and I had to clean it myself so that we could use it.  One set of bunk beds was well over my head and I'm 5'7". Really not safe for a kid to sleep in.The master bed is not comfortable. It looked like 2 foam mattresses on top of each other on a plywood frame. Anyways. your head and feet slope downhill but your midsection is high. We struggled to rest and woke up sore each morning. I hope they update the bed because the apartment is in a great location,Manager was very easy to contact and very helpful. The left a welcome basket with pasta and sauce. which saved our first night! We only had 45 minutes before we needed to be at a ticketed event and we were able to eat at home quickly. Lovely location and well appointed. clean kitchen.

Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 17  2017,7.9,The online photos led us to believe the apartment was much larger.  The shower had a lot of mold on it.  The TV's did not work but that problem was solved.,The location could not have been better and we enjoyed having so many bars and restaurants nearby.  We rented bikes for three days and explored Boston.

Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Benjamin,United States of America,1 review,January 6  2017,6.3,I didn't like the misrepresentation of the property with the onlinepictures. The unit I got was not even comparable with what was listedonline. I actually called the office to voice my concern and was toldthat the units were not garantied but was going to get componsation asthe lady obviously knew I was telling the truth. One of the staffmentioned that they had moved 4 other people that day because of similarissues. Also I had booked months in advance and explained that I wouldhave really liked checking in early because we had to go to my sistersgraduation after landing at the airport. I was told the day before thatthey were at 100% capacity and were not able to accommodate (which Iwould have completely understood). When we arrived later that day afterhaving to change at the airport we found out 3 unit were not at allrented. I really felt that the lady on the phone was not a very honestperson who just gave dry answers to get you off of the phone and not putany effort trying to help you enjoy your vacation. Therefore when shesaid I would be contacted the next day and given explainations about howto get componsated if I was willing to stay in the room which did notmeet in any regards what was advertised. and never got a call. I felt sodiscouraged to deal with this company that I just decided to give up.I'm happy I was with my family and we made our vacation together funanyways because I work in hospitality myself and this was veryinconsiderate service from the home office as the gentlemen who welcomedus on site was very nice. If there is something booking.com can do tohelp I would appreciate it.,I like the location of the place and the person who welcomed us.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Kim,United States of America,1 review,December 12  2016,5.8,Pictures and address of unit were deceiving. When we checked in. they brought us three buildings down the street to a dark and dreary apartment building. Not what we expected at all.,N/A

Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Sarane,United States of America,1 review,September 18  2016,9.6,Check-in process was a little confusing as it is an apartment building with long-term rentals.

Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Brian,United States of America,1 review,September 6  2016,7.5,Better information about parking. Customer service made the parking situation sound impossible. So.

Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Saitah,Kuwait,5 Reviews,July 28  2016,5.8,it was far from back bay. the building was old. there was no one to help us with the bags. they actually changed my apartment twice. the first one was from one location to the other. the second one was from one floor of the same building to the other. I actually hated that. Pretty expensive as well. I can get a room for 3 in a back bay hotel for the same price.,the beds were really nice and fluffy. the rooms and apartment in general were clean. the kitchen is really nice with all the appliances because I had to cook during ramadan. They have added some bathroom stuff like shampoos and creams which was nice. The view was incredible though.

Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,May 23  2016,8.3,The apartment was definitely picked up and tidy. but the floors weren't as clean as I would have liked.  We could have used more dishwasher soap to do one or two more loads.  There weren't very many cooking utensils.  Lots of construction around. so it was kinda noisy,Walking/biking distance to almost everything we wanted to see.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  It was a little pricy. but worth it to have a kitchen and space.  It was really easy to find. check into. and out of.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Abdullah,Saudi Arabia,4 Reviews,May 5  2016,4.2,Handed the room not cleaned.

Upon the check-out they had no place to keep my bags till my flight time I had to spend 5 hrs setting with 3 giant bags . What a terrible experience!,The location
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Todd,United States of America,1 review,May 5  2016,6.7,Parking was a hassle in the garage under the building. not clearly marked. staff tried to charge for events not the daily rate.  In the room. one of the beds was broken and the dishwasher was full of gray water and did not function.  Some of the lighting was on switches. some of the ones that were not did not have functioning on/off switches so turning them off required unplugging them.  The hallway outside of the apartment had an odor and it appeared that the carpet had not been cleaned in some time.  The water in the sinks and showers was either extremely hot or cold. nothing in between so using the shower was a challenge to not be scalded.  Sent an email to the property manager and have yet to get a reply regarding the issues.,Really convenient location. close to shopping. eateries. entertainment and the subway.  Decent view of the city. fairly quiet building.  Plenty of space in the apartment to entertain.  Very secure building with multiple locks from the front door to the apartment.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 3  2016,6.7,These are most definitely apartments and not a hotel. They are run by a corporate landlord that doesn't have the service mentality of a hotel. The price of this place is equivalent to that of a hotel so would expect the equivalent level of service. The 4pm check in is late and a money making scheme. A request to check in at 12 was met with a $200 charge. The apartments are serviced before you arrive but not during and you are requested to leave the apartment as clean as it was found - with the threat of additional charges if not.,Good location. clean apartment. Friendly person who takes you to the apartment.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Megan,United States of America,4 Reviews,April 25  2016,5.0,The apartment was not properly maintained and the list of items provided to be repaired were acknowledged by their team but no maintenance staff came to fix them during my stay.  The cable TV did not work and no instructions were in the apartment even though there were 4 remotes all with different functions.  The shower temperature was either scolding or cold. and the pressure very low. Finding the entrance was also not clear. as the entrance was at a different address than the apartment. This type of facility should not be considered to be suitable for booking.com. which should have at a minimum repairs made during a stay of 2 nights.  I have requested a partial refund with no reply on that from the apartment management company.  I believe this is the wrong type of facility for a short term booking engine.,The location and the helpful concierge when checking in.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Paul,United States of America,1 review,April 24  2016,4.6,No staff.No maids. No cafe. Keys didn't work. No concierge. Bad coffee in the room. Bad TV reception. No reception area. Questionable looking guests. Darkish hallways.,The beds were comfortable.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,April 19  2016,7.9,The only thing I personally would have liked better would have been a king size bed (which may have been available in some of the other apartments) and maybe a map with all of the surrounding amenities like restaurants and shopping areas as well as recommendations for where to purchase the tickets for public transportation and locations of the closest T and Bus Stops. The check out procedures were unclear as to where to put the garbage. but the front desk was able to help us out. so it worked out.,The location was great. Even though there was no restaurant connected w/the apartments themselves. there were 5 or 6 on the block. There was also a 24hr market across the street for any food needs and a Target on the opposite corner. Within walking distance of Fenway Park and The House of Blues. The neighborhood felt safe. We weren't concerned with having to walk to the T station in the dark at 5am when we left. The free wifi was super helpful. Since it was our first trip to Boston. we had to map out everywhere we wanted to go. The speed was great and it was a great amenity not offered by some of the large hotels in the area. Overall a very pleasant experience. We LOVED Boston and will definitely be back.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Sn,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 9  2016,8.8,Check-in process was extremely unclear!! Had to go to a completely different building to check in (in the rain). then back to hotel. Also. had to leave my ID w front desk to use the luggage cart. which was cumbersome. as I had to walk back to the other building (again. in the rain) to retrieve my ID. You do not have a key fob until you enter your hotel room. yet need a key fob for access to the building AND the elevators. So you have to rely on tenants to open door/elevator for you. Finally. you have a 'check out list' of items you have to clean. Why is there a $100 cleaning fee if there is so much work to do before leaving?!?,Hotel was super nice &amp; clean. great location. quiet. Windows everywhere. so view was awesome!

Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Thomas,United States of America,1 review,March 7  2016,5.8,The cost did not align for me with the value.  The shower is very weak and tough to get to a steady temperature..  The heating system is temperamental.  The walls are thin.  The TV channels are lacking for a furnished apartment.  The bathtub was not clean.  Still had cleaning product in it so I had to first scrub it before I could use it.  Ironing board but no iron that I could find easily and I looked.  There is a smell in the common areas and hallways that is hard to describe but it is not pleasant.,Location was good.  Many yummy places nearby to eat.  T is close with Kenmore and Fenway.  The staff are super friendly and very willing to help and very smiley.  The elevator is roomy.  Laundry in the room was very nice.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Frank,United States of America,1 review,February 23  2016,6.7,The place was laid out well with new appliances and great view.,I arrived at the room after traveling all day to find that the room wasn't clean. It made me wonder what the $100 cleaning fee was for..
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Woodlene,United States of America,5 Reviews,February 17  2016,9.6,Better cable. needs to upgrade service. The cable did not work at first. Newer furniture would be nice.,The residence is beautiful and there is a Starbucks conveniently located next door. It was very. very quiet and peaceful.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,February 15  2016,8.8,It took 36 hours to get the first key to the apartment and another 24 hours to get the second one. I had to push and push just to get a key. It was a pain to go to the concierge down the street and have them let me in the apartment all the time. This was not the concierge's responsibility but the group that rents the apartments.,Concierge service was excellent.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Mackenzie,United States of America,1 review,February 7  2016,5.8,The room was nice but cosmetically the paint needs to be touched up and the laundry detergent I was allergic to the smell.,The area is perfect close to a lot of touristy things for us to visit and there are a bunch of bars and restaurants in the area.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Guido,United States of America,5 Reviews,January 30  2016,2.5,Didn't respect the same place I paid for. Construction near. loudy.Full of dogs burkin on the hallsNo room serviceThey change my hotel and didn't explain why. they charged me an extra fee for a room I didn't asked for. and couldn't claim until now.,Confort.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Fito,United States of America,2 Reviews,January 6  2016,7.9,For the amount I paid for this unit parking should have been free. The first day we had to deal with cold water and bad toilet. When the problems were brought up to the staff they pointed fingers at the leasing company. and when they leasing company was called they pointed the finger to the building staff. Problems were eventually correct.,Location was very good. Buses and trains were accessible.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Paula,Uruguay,11 Reviews,December 18  2015,8.3,There is a building construction right in front of the window. and a lot of noise is heard during working hours.

The view from the apartment was amazing.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Mark,United States of America,3 Reviews,December 17  2015,7.9,I had to call the first couple of days to get the shower fixed and the toilet replaced.  There are tiles that have apparently been wet and have curled on the edges and I tripped on them a couple of times.  Also. 2 drawers in the dresser were broken.  For a luxury apartment. I should not have this many issues.  Other units in this building may be luxury. but I really would not call 1431 luxury.  It was nice and I actually could see myself living there but I wouldn't let all the little things go to the wayside like they have.,The location was excellent to the green line and plenty of places to eat in the area.  Owners did respond to issues I called them about very quickly.
Global Luxury Suites at Fenway Park,Marnie,United States of America,1 review,November 2  2015,7.1,Poor condition in some areas. Microwave handle was broken. furniture liked a bit tough.

Apartment in Historic Location,Cecilia,United States of America,1 review,October 24  2017,8.8,The apartment needs a little TLC.  I wrote the owner and suggested a few small fixes that would make this apartment a 5 star property.  She was grateful for my comments and said she would look into it.  (minor fixes---such as replace lightbulbs. etc.),The location is great.  Easy to access the subway and/or to walk to downtown Boston and surrounding areas.  The apartment layout is great and nicely furnished.  The apartment has a keypad so entry was quite easy and there was no fear of losing/misplacing a key.  I would stay here again!
Apartment in Historic Location,Sergey,Russia,1 review,October 22  2017,10,N/A,We stayed here October 19th. 2017 with a friend. Proprietress Cora was very friendly. helpful and attentive. She patiently asked all our questions. advised the possible ways of transfer to the airport. Breakfast and beverages were complimentary. that's rather seldom for apartments accommodation. Everything's clean and nice. Comfortable location. Fast WiFi. It was a very pleasant stay. I would strongly recommend anyone to book these apartments.

The bed was very comfortable. Great choice for couples or a family with kids.
Apartment in Historic Location,Kathryn,United Kingdom,1 review,August 21  2017,5.4,As the settee was being used for my daughter's bed and was very large. it took up a lot of room and there were only two dining chairs to sit at but three of us. Not very comfortable! The photographs provided were misleading as it looked as though there was an outside decked area but this was not the case. Money had obviously been spent on the large TV. adjustable bed and designer towels but the cutlery was very odd (all items individually packaged in plastic pockets) and the timer on the cooker was broken. There was air conditioning in the living room but this was too noisily to use at night as it kept daughter awake as she was sleeping in there. We also did not like the suggestion of the host that if we gave a 5 star review she would not charge us for the snacks and drinks she had left for us.,It was clean and well located
Apartment in Historic Location,Ron,Belgium,8 Reviews,July 21  2017,3.8,Loud. poor air conditioner-not clean in corners -no fresh air- thought I would be in upper apartment - this should be on Air BnB not Booking.com standards,Location is best part. despite this being a GROUND floor apt

Back Bay Beacon,Anonymous,United Kingdom,11 Reviews,October 28  2017,7.1,In our suite there were low ceilings in the bedrooms so you couldn't stand up straight if you were tall (they are at a sort of mezzanine level to the main room which isn't mentioned in details) and everything was a bit tired (broken tiles on the floor and walls in the bathroom).,Location was brilliant. right in the center of Boston so easy to get to and from all the sights of the city.
Back Bay Beacon,Caroline,Australia,1 review,September 12  2017,7.5,The building is old so the tenants who were above us who were walked around all night from 12.30am to 5.30am with their shoes on kept us awake.The kitchen though well equiped did not have basics like salt pepper. sugar sachets. coffee sachets. Whilst there was a washing machine in the lobby there was no option to buy a single use washing powder. The nearest convenience store was 15 minutes walk. The blind in bedroom was broken so we were unable to block out the light. The apartment was stuffy as we were unable to open any window. The air conditioner had a mind of its own and was very loud. The refrigerator was also very loud.,Spacious and clean. Well equiped kitchen. The shower was good.
Back Bay Beacon,Bryan,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 6  2017,9.6,Had a little issue getting the access codes. I had to call because I had not received email a few days before we left and once we got there the room/code was to someone else's room. I called the help number and the issue was cleared right up.,Great location. plenty of room and really easy to access.
Back Bay Beacon,JosÃ©,Spain,1 review,August 4  2017,6.7,There were some things that were wrong or did not work properly. which was something we definitively did not expect for such a high rental house (about USD 500 per only one night).These area the main shortages we spotted:- There was a broken mirror in one of the bedrooms upstairs.- The TV did not work (to be precise. only one channel works). May be we were not enough handy to manage it properly. if that were the case some "light shedder" instructions were missed.- The WIFI signal was upsettingly weak. so it came and went very often.- The curtains in the bedrooms were not effective at all. Those in the bathrooms were antiesthetic and healthyless.- There was not a modern coffee machine (Nespresso or similar).- We did not find a broomstick.- One of the sofÃ¡s in the living room had a cut.- The lift did not work the check out day so we had to carry our luggage by the stairs (and we were on the sixth floor!).All in all. I consider a $ 350 price per night would be much more fair than the $ 500 price we paid for it. I actually use this report to claim for that $ 150 difference.,The location was excellent. The flat was cool.
Back Bay Beacon,Ma2nc,United States of America,1 review,August 2  2017,7.9,The apartment could use some TLC. The bathrooms were fine. but could use a makeover. There were crumbs left on the bottom shelf of the fridge from the previous guests. If you are tall (over 5'9') you will not be able to stand up straight in the bedrooms. These issues were minor. Overall it is a great place. We stayed one night. as we were in town for a Red Sox game and it was perfect for our family and met our needs.,Location was fantastic! Steps from the Public Garden and very close (short walk) from Arlington T station. Very cool apartment. We were in 2R. Compact. but well done. A typical Boston brownstone apartment. Loved the kitchen and common areas. Great space for a family of 5 to spread out. Easy access to building due to key codes.
Back Bay Beacon,Scott,United States of America,1 review,July 13  2017,7.5,Several of the lights did not work. Bathroom exhaust fan did not work.,Good location close to the T and within walking distance of the North End and major historic sites.

Back Bay Beacon,Chi,United States of America,1 review,June 15  2017,8.3,My apartment was on the 4th floor with super high and narrow stairs. so wasn't fun for us to move in and out with all of our suitcases. Wifi was excruciatingly slow. The apartment was old and small so felt a bit stuffy and cramped sometimes. Also I had a package delivered but it was lost (which is not back bay's fault). but that made my experience somewhat worse.,The place was excellently located. right next to boston public garden!
Back Bay Beacon,Kenneth,United Kingdom,1 review,June 4  2017,7.9,Need to provide facilities to leave luggage at the property. It is a long way to take luggage to office.,Views of city skyline and plenty of room to relax
Back Bay Beacon,Timothy,United States of America,1 review,May 16  2017,4.6,The room wasn't clean upon arrival.  Was moved to another room then had to move back. You could hear the people above us. Sounded like herd of elephants.,In a nice neighborhood.
Back Bay Beacon,Sarah,Australia,3 Reviews,April 6  2017,10,A number of lights not working - particularly the one by the front door - very communal hallway which could do with a bit of maintenance. Only minor  things though - would still definitely recommend.,Quiet neighbourhood in great location - easy walk to Cheers Bar. Boston Common and old town centre.  Very comfortable bedding and generally well maintained.
Back Bay Beacon,Meaghan,Australia,2 Reviews,February 1  2017,8.3,Apartment was a little cramped. and the set up was challenging with a toddler (I didn't see stairs in the photos).,Location was amazing and easy check in. Very clean. and reception was quick to address our questions and issues.
Back Bay Beacon,Wendy,Australia,4 Reviews,January 9  2017,7.1,Couldn't turn a bright spotlight off in kitchen area that kept us awake at night. Sent an email but they were unable to help.No plug for kitchen.Some confusion with our late checkout. I don't think the cleaners had been told so apartment cleaned while we were out. all bags moved and our food in fridge (that we were going to eat for light snack before flying out) had been thrown out. :(,Allowed us a late check out so we could leave our bags all day as we had an evening flight outPrompt replies to e-nailsLiked key code for entrances rather than keys/cards

Back Bay Beacon,peterduckett17,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,December 1  2016,9.2,WIFI did drop out and in and if there would been fresh milk etc just to make a coffee but not much,We like the split level place / rooms and the location was great right on Boston green - views of the state house (as seen in the film "The Departed") cheers bar (did "%years ago) we did find a few broken bits etc but overall we liked it very much.
Back Bay Beacon,Robert,Ireland,27 Reviews,November 20  2016,6.7,the bed was old and creaky....Guys! Invest in a quality bed! Business travellers need a good night's sleep. The TV was hit and miss on the sound...sometimes it worked. sometimes it didn't. Wifi didn't work at all one night but was fixed within hours of being reported.,Location was very central. Access was smooth. Late checkout was very much appreciated.
Back Bay Beacon,Mary,Ireland,8 Reviews,November 18  2016,7.0,This is a remotely controlled location.  When my partner arrived off a transatlantic flight. the room code he was given didn't work and it took a while to sort this out over the phone.  We would have liked to be able to leave luggage at this location as we had a whole day in Boston after check-out time. An alternative location was offered but it was quite a distance away.,The apartment was clean. spacious and comfortable. Everything worked and the wi-fi was efficient. We needed a left luggage option. which was offered at an alternative location where the staff was very friendly and helpful.
Back Bay Beacon,Dawn,United States of America,1 review,November 13  2016,10,Didn't realize the elevator was there until after I walked up the stairs with luggage..no real problems.,Great location to walk to just about everything. short cab ride if needed.

Back Bay Beacon,Erin,United States of America,1 review,October 27  2016,8.8,Kitchen faucet leaked slightly and blow dryer needed to be replaced. but that was completed within a few hours.  The front door did not have an inside "hotel style" lock. which left me feeling a little uneasy with only the keypad.,Stayed in 113 Beacon 1F; completely renovated two bedroom with kitchen and living room. gorgeous architecture. plenty of space.  Great location being a mile or so from the Hynes Convention center.
Back Bay Beacon,Rhona_J,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 17  2016,9.2,Apartment 1F provided two double rooms. open off the main lounge. no windows to outside. noise within apartment and other apartments travels.,Location ideal for exploring Boston.

Back Bay Beacon,Robert,United Kingdom,17 Reviews,September 27  2016,8.8,Very noisy. as our apartment was right next to the front door. you could hear everyone coming and going.  You could also hear everything from the upstairs apartment when they started moving at 5am every morning.,Great location
Back Bay Beacon,Jo,New Zealand,13 Reviews,September 1  2016,10,The bathrooms could do with an update... they were clean though.,We loved staying here!

Back Bay Beacon,Kathlyn,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 6  2016,9.6,I found the bed sort of uncomfortable.,Spacious and attractive for two and we had two family members over for dinner. Excellent location and beautiful neighborhood.loved staying in a Boston brownstone. We made all our meals there.
Back Bay Beacon,Joanna,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,August 2  2016,5.0,Really disappointed with this apartment. Photos were not representative. It is very dark inside and needs a refurb. The 2 bathrooms were clean but mirrors and tiles were cracked; no plug for the bath. Carpet throughout stained and worn. No lift in the building; access is up a narrow staircase. No room to stand up in the bedrooms for anyone over 6 feet tall. The kitchen was nice but the whole place was claustrophobic and gloomy.,Good location for sightseeing.
Back Bay Beacon,Justine,United States of America,5 Reviews,July 26  2016,8.3,I requested a late check-out time which the staff told me was fine but when I arrived at my room after breakfast the cleaning staff was already in there. There were a few light bulbs out we're not working therefore we did not have a lot of lights. If you want to leave laid there is no place to put your luggage unless you drive to a different location. I felt like that was very inconvenient for us and that we had later flight and did not have anywhere close by to store our luggage.,I love the location of the property for the price. It was a very unique place to stay at. The size of the place was just right for us.
Back Bay Beacon,Mt,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,July 10  2016,7.9,The rooms were a good size and we were impressed with the design of the property when we first arrived however the overall finish was not great everywhere. There was a glass panel missing from the bathroom wall and the tiling was not well finished. I think it would help to have a welcome pack with information on where to find the washing facilities. what to do with trash. some maps and also how best to book a taxi when it was time to leave.,The property was in an excellent location beside Boston Common making it very easy to walk to different locations. The rooms were a good size and we were fortunate to be located on the first floor so only a few steps up to the front door to manage with our cases when we arrived. We weren't able to have a late check out but the staff were very helpful and we were able to leave our bags at their office. This worked out well for us and meant we didn't waste our last day in the city before heading to the airport.
Back Bay Beacon,Manci,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 4  2016,7.1,The bed upstairs in 1R was horrendous. It's obviously old and worn. Time for a change. Also. the A/C really only does a good job cooling the first floor. We had to arrange the fans to blow cooler air upstairs and that made it barely tolerable. Highs were only around 83. so I can't imagine it in the 90s. Those two things really impacted our overall opinion.,The location was excellent and the place was pretty clean. Both big deals.
Back Bay Beacon,Gillian,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,June 24  2016,8.3,Quite a cosy apartment and hot during our stay. The air conditioning could have been better.,Excellent location. great to be able to relax and do our own thing in Boston.

Back Bay Beacon,Family,United States of America,1 review,June 20  2016,7.5,The walls were paper thin and we could hear every word of the guests staying in the unit next door.  A group was having a party on our last night and it was extremely loud.

Back Bay Beacon,Anonymous,Germany,11 Reviews,June 19  2016,4.6,Very noisy. so you can hear everything from the neighbours especially the toillets.The furniture was old and partially damaged.At our arrival we could switch the lights on and have to find the breaker box for ourselves because there is no local service.Most of the wall sockets are not working.,You have an appartment in the center of Boston. Enough place for four persons.
Back Bay Beacon,Russell,United States of America,1 review,June 16  2016,8.3,Map in room was hard to read.  Need to add smaller spoons in tableware.

Back Bay Beacon,Misty,United States of America,4 Reviews,June 7  2016,10,Should you need to store your bags at 99 St Botoloph location be prepared for a hike or else take a cab. Also. there were no forks... Only spoons and knives. ğŸ˜Š,Excellent experience! Located in a wonderful and central part of the city. The apt was spotless. Very quiet and very comfy. The only issue was when we went to store our bags the day we checked out. we didn't realize how far it was from the apt. Wish we would have been told to take a cab there.

One-Bedroom on Arch Street Apt 2C,Anonymous,Germany,1 review,October 25  2017,5.4,The property was not very clean. The apartment was very loud. as you could hear everything happening on the busy street right below since the windows were not at all sound-proof. The couch bed was terrible. therefore the apartment is not recommended for more than two people who don't want to share a bed or for those who are light sleepers. The apartment cost $350 per night during the week I stayed there and was definitely not worth the price.,The location was very central. The kitchen was well equipped.
One-Bedroom on Arch Street Apt 2C,Grace,United States of America,1 review,July 1  2017,7.9,The bedroom was very small for 4 people.  Would be a better fit for 2 people.  Wifi didn't work well.  Pull-out sofa sleeper was not very comfortable for sleeping on.,Very convenient location with many attractions within walking distance.  Nice full kitchen.  Sonder was very helpful in answering all of our questions in a very timely manner.
One-Bedroom on Arch Street Apt 2C,Peter,United States of America,1 review,April 17  2017,7.5,My wife was told bed linens were included.  Upon arrival the linens for the pullout were missing.  Sonder did make arrangements to get us linnens that night so all turned out well. Parking was also a challenge and expensive.,Nice central location

Boston Harbor Hotel,Kishore,India,1 review,October 29  2017,8.3,House keeping was slow and left a little to be desired. They would do the rooms but forget to rinse the coffee cups and so on.,Incredibly friendly and helpful staff- from reception to concierge to the waiters at the Sea Grille.The view from the harbour facing room was super.Good food at the Sea Grille with a good choice of drinks at the bar.
Boston Harbor Hotel,Anonymous,Australia,5 Reviews,October 26  2017,10,N/A,View was superb.  I couldn't connect to the wifi as it wasn't encrypted so security was low. Staff were very very helpful and friendly. Definitely stay again. Good spot.  Financial district a little too quiet on weekends and tough to get breakfast outside of hotel but hotel food was good.
Boston Harbor Hotel,Sjcooper,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 25  2017,9.6,No tea or coffee facilities in room. Could order from room service however not before 6am.,Very comfy beds. two very large screen TV’s and plenty of space for you to watch one channel and children another.

Boston Harbor Hotel,Simone,United Kingdom,10 Reviews,September 30  2017,9.6,Nothing,Brilliant Harbour location. The Harbour walk is great for jogging too. Friendly locals. Best beds. spacious rooms. Use the Rowes wharf water taxi service for great transfers around the bay and airport.
Boston Harbor Hotel,Gayle,Australia,14 Reviews,September 30  2017,8.3,Room service food very poor quality and room service very very slow. You don't always get what you order.

Boston Harbor Hotel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,27 Reviews,September 23  2017,10,They didn't tell us about any of the facilities when we arrived. pool etc and availability of breakfast etc - I could have asked obviously but only thought after and surprises me that they hadn't mentioned any of it.We had problem with a taxi they arranged for us. we told them where we wanted to go but turned out the driver didn't have a clue and we ended up getting dropped off in a dark street and having to find our own way!,The service was spot on and perfect 5 star.The room was lovely and well equipped.The bar was great and the barman was amazing (sorry I didn't get his name) - real shame we only tried it on our last day as would have definitely kept returning otherwise!
Boston Harbor Hotel,Joseph,United States of America,1 review,August 14  2017,10,The only nitpick I have is the pillows.  I prefer firm and these were too soft for my liking.  The traffic on Atlantic Ave. is terrible. but that's not the Hotel's fault.  As soon as we got close enough to turn our car over to the valets. driving ceased to be an aggravation for me for 24 hours.,The staff was all wonderful.  From the valet parking. doormen. front desk. room service. housekeeping and the bartenders - all went above and beyond in making our stay memorable.
Boston Harbor Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 14  2017,10,Unfortunately due to repairs and renovations the weekend of August 12th. the hotel elevators were painfully slow causing us to wait upwards of 5 minutes. Otherwise the property. staff and facilities were phenomenal.,N/A
Boston Harbor Hotel,Ruth,United States of America,1 review,August 12  2017,9.6,When we arrived to the hotel we made a reservation to have breakfast outside the following morning. However. the following day we were told that we could not eat outside for an hour to an hour and a half. There was staff outside setting up the tables. Plenty of staff inside too standing around. Since this hotel could not accommodate us. we left and had breakfast at a different hotel. which was serving breakfast outside.,N/A
Boston Harbor Hotel,Clare,Switzerland,18 Reviews,August 9  2017,10,We loved everything!,This is an amazing hotel. The staff are super efficient from the bellboys to the front desk and concierge. The harbour view rooms are spectacular.
Boston Harbor Hotel,Michelle,United States of America,1 review,August 4  2017,9.2,I had a beautiful suite. but it was a little strange to have to walk through sitting area to get to bathroom (disoriented in middle of night).   Hosting company covered my cost but I thought it was overpriced. $350 -$450 more in line with other similar suites in other high-end locations.  My flight was cancelled and I was on a day trip. so more high quality toiletries would have been great (especially for price). e.g. Good quality face lotion.For a suite. little touches also may have an impact on more positive impression. e.g. robe laid out on bed. candy on pillow. complementary water on bedside table. etc.,Beautiful hotel with fantastic view from my suite. Bed was excellent- soft sheets and right amount of firmness. Bathroom very clean.  Enjoyed materials for make-up removal. Appreciated outlets on bedside table. Very easy access to WiFi is nice (no password). Air purifier was an unexpected treat. Room was very quiet and although there were several large windows to enjoy the view. there was complete black-out when they were closed.
Boston Harbor Hotel,Janet,United States of America,1 review,July 31  2017,9.6,Prices were higher in the "casual" restaurant than seemed warranted.,The service was very helpful and kind. never snooty despite our coming in looking quite wind blown and messy on occasion. Very well trained staff throughout.
Boston Harbor Hotel,Giovanella,United States of America,1 review,July 11  2017,9.6,I unfortunately had to call a few times to ask for directions to your hotel. Although the hotel was minutes away crom the Aquarium.  it took much of my time away for touring the city to get settled in locating your hotel. May I suggest providing a map via email after the reservation confirmation is set?  A simple map of Atlantic street with landmakrks for new cliental that never stayed at your hotel would be of much assistance.  An airport shuttle would be extremely beneficial as well.,Health &amp; Spa personnel and hotel personnel who maintained cleanliness of rooms were every so kind and professional... VERY WELL DONE. STAFF!
Boston Harbor Hotel,Peter,Belgium,46 Reviews,July 1  2017,7.9,Pretty far away from the city center. Hotel didn't have the feeling of a place people like to spend time at.,Pretty good location if you are visiting a congress. Rooms were big.
Boston Harbor Hotel,Christine,United States of America,5 Reviews,June 9  2017,10,N/A,The staff are so accommodating and personable.

Boston Harbor Hotel,Catherine,United Kingdom,34 Reviews,May 30  2017,9.6,There is no kettle in the room even though the concierge said he would send one up.The shower is fixed with no hand held spray so difficult to wash hair,The view was fabulous and the staff very attentive

Boston Harbor Hotel,MoStan,Ireland,3 Reviews,May 22  2017,8.3,No tea/coffee facilities in the room.Water and turn down service arrived on 2nd evening only.,Great location and friendly staff. Nice hotel but expensive for what it is.
Boston Harbor Hotel,Lisa,United States of America,1 review,May 22  2017,8.3,N/A,The location can not be beat. Robbie the doorman was exceptional. Our corner room had a fantastic view of the city. Unfortunately the toilet ran all night. Also the A/C would only go down to 65 degrees which was not cool enough for me. Overall a nice stay. Did not eat on the property so can not speak to that.
Boston Harbor Hotel,Simon,United States of America,1 review,April 24  2017,10,Pretty much nothing.,Got upgraded to a suite. Luxurious room. very private and quiet. View over Boston harbor from the huge wall to wall windows in each room were incredible.The valet and front desk staff were excellent. The agreed to keep my car for a while after check out while we went for lunch near by. In room breakfast was excellent and very prompt. The mini bar was well stocked with a nice selection. Bed was very comfortable. two TVs shower with choice of shower heads. Huge spa bath. Long hallway within the suite leading down to the rooms made for very private feel.Dog was welcomed for a fee and they provided everything we needed - treats. bed. water and food bowls etc. All in all. the whole stay exceeded my expectations.

The staff and accommodations are outstanding in every way.  My harbor front room was just beautiful and the bed was like heaven!  I dined in two of the three restaurants and all three meals were delicious. with beautiful surroundings and great service.  I enjoyed my weekend in Boston immensely and I plan on returning to the Boston Harbor hotel soon!  Loved it!
Boston Harbor Hotel,David,United States of America,1 review,February 11  2017,7.9,room service forgot my breakfast. but did deliver one later and took the charge off; the bartender in the Rowe's Wharf bar wrongly refused to serve me after I had had maybe 2 or 3 drinks. I was not in the least bit disruptive. was having pleasant conversations with my neighbors at the bar (none of whom I knew). and of course. I was staying at the hotel--seeking shelter from the storm.  I know bartenders have discretion on such things. but I thought it was totally inappropriate in my case. the people around me at the bar agreed and I reported this to the manager.  My office has had 3 or 4 holiday parties there. but if anything like that happens again. you won't see me in that establishment,front desk was great and room service took care of the bill when they did not deliver the breakfast when ordered

Boston Harbor Hotel,Dan,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,December 14  2016,9.6,As with all hotels of this type. room service is a little over-priced. but that is to be expected.

I know it's an old house. but we heard our neighbors  quarreling several times and it felt a bit unpleasant.,A home away from home is just the right description.

Boston Harbor Hotel,Sami,United Kingdom,28 Reviews,October 7  2016,3.8,Wa have stayed in the  for 3 nights and merely because of its good rating. We were very disappointed. The rooms were dated. not very clean. and not to a 5 star level. Bathroom looked very tired and dark. The view was great but the lack of quality was disappointing. For $600 a night one expect a coffee/tea maker and a well stocked minibar.  Dinning in the hotel wasn't great too. slow service and high prices. Next time I'll spend my money somewhere else.,Staff were friendly. check in and out of was quite quick.

Boston Harbor Hotel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,September 21  2016,9.2,Weird free-standing air purifier machine in room was very off putting.,It's great but it's overpriced and slightly old-fashioned in a frumpy way. You could find another hotel 90% as nice for 50% of the price.
Boston Harbor Hotel,Gemma,United Kingdom,1 review,September 20  2016,10,Nothing-our trip there was superb and they are faultless,Friendly and thoughtful staff who went to the trouble to acknowledge our first anniversary. facilities are top quality and the bed is the best I have ever slept in other than my own. Location is really handy for all that goes on at the harbour. it was a lively and cultural part of town. Thank you for a wonderful stay that we will not forget.
Boston Harbor Hotel,Clyde,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 15  2016,10,They need to allow you get your own ice.  They will not let you into the ice machine room and I still don't understand their reasoning.  They think it is for better service and controlling people bringing in their own products but to call up everytime you need ice is not convenient.,Service. location
Boston Harbor Hotel,Sami,United Kingdom,28 Reviews,September 15  2016,4.2,Over priced and not worth the money. No swimming for a large hotel on the harbour. The rooms need updating and the bathroom looked very tired. There are no coffee and tea makers in the rooms.,Good lucation. Comfortable bed. Friendly staff.
Boston Harbor Hotel,Antony,United Kingdom,1 review,September 12  2016,6.7,the room was poorly prepared on arrival and there were clearly visible foot and fingerprint marks on the glass counter tops and draws etc.,friendly staff
Boston Harbor Hotel,Amin,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,September 11  2016,9.6,Nothing,Team were very efficient and friendly. I have stayed at hundreds of hotels. Some regarded as the best in the world. However. the experience I enjoyed at this hotel was amazing. I asked Nigel.hotel concierge. to book a restaurant for me. Which he did as expected. when it came to ordering deserts. Nigel had arranged for some cookies to be made and signed by the complements of the Boston Harbour Hotel. This was an excellent touch that will be remembered and will always recommend and return to this hotel.
Boston Harbor Hotel,Gary,United States of America,1 review,September 7  2016,9.6,breakfast was very expensive glad we didn't eat in the dinner restaurant very overpriced one night with breakfast $ 700.00,everyone was very nice great customer service
Boston Harbor Hotel,Matteo,Luxembourg,60 Reviews,August 29  2016,9.6,Actually nothing. To be really picky a slightly larger room would have been better especially if you want to keep a luggage open for during your stay.,Everything. This is a real 5-star hotel with outstanding service. super well-trained staff ready to anticipate your needs. The Sea Grill restaurant was excellent as well with quality of service in line with the hotel. Cleanliness was outstanding. Excellent harbor view from the 9th floor. Super clean room. The decision would be a no-brainier if back to the city. no need to look for something else.
Boston Harbor Hotel,Anna,Ireland,15 Reviews,August 28  2016,8.3,No tea and coffee making facilities and the food in the main restaurant  was just ok . go across the road to the Palm Restuarant instead .,Beds very comfortable . beautiful view of the bay

Boston Harbor Hotel,Me,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,August 16  2016,9.2,Good food at Sea Grille...but on our first night we waited over an hour for our appetisers to appear after ordering. Total time for a 2 course meal... Over 2 hours. Staff did apologise BUT we had flown in from London that day and simply wanted a quick meal... Not to be. Breakfast at sea grille... Good food and I don't mind paying for high quality... But they charged $6 for the filter coffee they pour from a carafe. Meanwhile. we could have stood up. walked 5 steps to get the complimentary coffee that they provide to guests. Small things do make a difference. Also. no coffee machines in the rooms and no plastic laundry bag. They thought of everything (including named collar stiffners for a man's shirt -fab) but little niggles like no coffee machine. no laundry bag and a $6 filter coffee that you get gratis at most restaurants do irk! Loved the hotel and these are only meant to highlight to make the stay perfect.,Loved the Harbor view. Staff was very friendly.
Boston Harbor Hotel,Lauren,United States of America,1 review,July 26  2016,9.6,The hotel is very expensive however. you get what you pay for.,The location is wonderful.

Boston Harbor Hotel,Maniche,India,2 Reviews,December 28  2015,9.6,Nothing really.,The experience was very pleasurable. The staff was very helpful and did whatever they could to make your stay very comfortable. Booked it for a friend who wanted to propose his gf here and both of them were very happy. We didn't face any problem in decorating the room.
Boston Harbor Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,8 Reviews,December 24  2015,10,Although the waiters have been extremely kind and attentive. the quality and variety of food at the restaurant was not great….,The hotel decor. the view from the bedroom window. the impeccable service everywhere.Bar very welcoming ; antique maps in the lobby worth looking at and admiring !
Boston Harbor Hotel,James,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,November 3  2015,10,Not a complaint but a suggestion for improvement. Install Tea or Coffee facilities in rooms.,The building itself is expansive but not overpowering. exceptionally clean and precise attention to detail. The Harbour front rooms have views to die for and the bed is just so comfortable.
Boston Harbor Hotel,Salah,Saudi Arabia,4 Reviews,November 2  2015,9.2,Not much and I hate to give comments about such nice hotel. however. the only thing bothered me that the room was not equipped with coffee maker. however. they compensate for that by complementary coffee at the sea grille restaurant at the lobby floor. Also. there are no smoking room. but. I think it is the state law.,Fast check in. helpful staff. location. fast free wifi. secure. ..well a lot of good qualities. I recommend it and certainly it will be my first choice whenever I get to Boston.

Welcome to Boston,Marjorie,United States of America,1 review,October 20  2017,9.2,There was only parking by the house one of the nights we were there. The rest of the nights we had to park on the next street over. which is not far.,The house was very clean. The host provided all of the amenities we could have wanted. including fresh fruit! Wonderful place to stay.
Welcome to Boston,Michael,United States of America,1 review,September 14  2017,10,Nothing at all.,Property was very clean. property owners accommodation was wonderful. place was sufficient for 8 single men who were sleeping separately in their separate beds and the many amenities the property has.
Welcome to Boston,Roger,Italy,1 review,August 2  2017,10,N/A,Owner was extremely helpful and even arranged for a baby stroller for our use there.  Position is good; convenient to train. banks. and various shops.  Space was more than adequate for our group of 6; it could potentially sleep a few more.  Many kitchen/cooking supplies were provided.  We grilled in the back yard.  Being able to cook really saved big money for us as compared to sleeping six in a hotel for five days.  The neighbors are friendly and one came from across the street to tell us that we had left the door open on our van.  Highly recommended !!

Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Allyn,United States of America,1 review,October 30  2017,5.8,The location was terrible. It was loud. I was unable to sleep due to constant Sirens. trucks honking their horn. and general traffic. I was woken in the middle of the night by gunshots. Not to be insensitive to our societal needs. but there were so many homeless people out and around the exterior of the hotel that I felt very unsafe. The parking lot was a half a block over. and I was worried about my car being stolen or broken into the entire time. I would not under any circumstance recommend anybody staying at this hotel.,The staff was lovely. The room was clean. The entry Lobby was pleasant.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Diane,United Kingdom,14 Reviews,October 20  2017,8.3,The hotel is very open about the fact that the location is in an industrial area &amp; close to a hospital. They provide guests with earplugs to help with sleep. We were on the 5th floor at the front of the building &amp; there was a lot of noise from traffic &amp; sirens. but it didnâ€™t bother us. it may be a problem for others. The area around the hotel is populated by homeless people &amp; we did see one lady who was completely â€œout of itâ€�. That said. our car was parked by the hotel &amp; was safe &amp; nobody bothered us when we went out. I would say though that guests are encouraged to wait in the hotel lobby for the shuttle rather than go outside. I believe this is because of the neighbourhood. The shuttle was great for us though. We were able to leave the car parked &amp; take a short ride into the centre of Boston during our stay,The hotel has a free shuttle which takes guests to the Andrew subway station. From there it is 3 stops to Downtown ($5.50 return). The staff were very friendly &amp; the room comfortable. The choice at breakfast was excellent
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,October 18  2017,8.8,Location. We were advised not to walk the streets alone at night. A lot of noise from the street below during the night.,Staff were friendly and helpful with all our needs.

Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Phyllis,United States of America,1 review,October 11  2017,9.6,The hotel is in a busy area. so there is much traffic noise.  I chose it because it is centrally located.,Employees showed a real interest in meeting my needs.  I am 91 and felt very comfortablewith their obvious desire to make my stay memorable.  The structure and design of the building was creative.  I could have enjoyed more time there and the room would have been very comfortable for 2 or 4 people.  It was called a suite because the sitting area was really well set up.They had a shuttle that was available from early AM into the evening.  My shuttle driver went out of his usual route in order to show me a building I knew of  70 years ago. When my reunion meeting was over. the shuttle driver on the next shift knew of my morning trip.  I felt the employees took an honest interest in their customers.   The breakfast bar was super.  I met other happy travelers there.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Giovanni,United States of America,1 review,October 9  2017,2.5,They were suppoust to tell me at the from desk the the rates change every night all do I book for two days. it when from 149 to 267 without not explanations.

Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 8  2017,5.4,Shuttles to the t station could have been more frequent than just two drops in the morningThe hotel is out of the way with limited options to get away. Public transport is a couple of miles through an industrial area. Not recommended if you're travelling to see Boston,Room was big
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Adrian,United Kingdom,28 Reviews,October 6  2017,9.2,Situated near a busy noisy road. close to a busy hospital and on an industrial estate with security lighting on all night.I would not walk out after dark.,The room was at the top of the hotel and the room was more than adequate with comfy bed and spacious bathroom.The staff were very helpful.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Anonymous,Canada,1 review,October 3  2017,5.0,Right next to a hospital you could hear the ambulances coming and going all day and night. They did provide ear plugs. Not as close to the city core as we were lead to believe. 20 minute shuttle ride to the city core.  We were also overcharged from what we were quoted when we booked. and so far have not been able to get the difference back.,The room was great very spacious and very clean. The breakfast was very good with a great hot and cold selection. The lady looking after the breakfast room was great. she kept everything full and clean.

Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Joan,Canada,5 Reviews,September 17  2017,9.2,Near and passing through the parking lot were drug addicts that we could see getting high and hear throughout the night. I was somewhat stressed when I was in the parking lot. I interrupted a deal going down when I came down in the morning. It made our stay difficult and uncomfortable. The staff said they are working with the police. There were a lot of sirens in the neighbourhood. Our car and in the hotel were safe in the end. In our room we found ear plugs beside the bed!!,Beautiful accommodation. We had a king suite. Good breakfast.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Linda,United States of America,1 review,September 15  2017,7.1,The area was terrible; dangerous or so perceived and very noisy with clusters of homeless peopleoutside all night long.,Breakfast was good. but unimaginative;  the  room temperature was fine. The staff was veryaccommadating  and helpful especially the shuttle driver. Enrique.  He literally took me to theTarget store and waited for me because he was concerned about the abundance of homelesspeople on the street.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Guillaume,United States of America,6 Reviews,September 14  2017,7.9,The outside noise is really to high and start at 4:00 by an enterprise behind the hotel.Double or triple windows are necessary.There is also a permanent noise in the walls that is not relaxing.,Not far from the center by car (15min.)Very easy for parking at the hotel.Nice room.Very fast check-in and check-out.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Charles,United States of America,1 review,September 12  2017,7.1,Less junkies in the streets around the hotel.,Ms. Rosario who was in charge of the breakfast was absolutely  amazing. Hard working. and truly professional. What a great job she does !  I just can't say enough to express how impressed we were with her.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Maree,Australia,3 Reviews,September 12  2017,4.6,Location was awful. Seedy neighborhood. nowhere to eat and no transport.  Shuttle bus provided by hotel insufficient and unreliable. Left waiting at train station for 45 minutes after designated pick up time!,Clean room

The free breakfast was the best I've ever had and the lady working it was completely on top of things at all times. keeping it clean and the food fresh. I would definitely stay here again.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Josi,Canada,4 Reviews,September 8  2017,5.4,The location is just terrible. full of drug addicts and homeless people around during day and night. even in the parking. which is open. We felt very unsafe. Also. the smell was disgusting. as they use the surroundings as their toilet.We decided to use the shuttle one day and the driver was 15 minutes late because he was sleeping in the van. He only woke up because the receptionist called him after we complained. The receptionist who checked us in was not friendly at all and barely even looked at me. She was very unhappy to be there.,The room was comfortable and large enough for 4 adults.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Katrin,Austria,3 Reviews,September 8  2017,7.1,Unfortunately. I left after the first night as this hotel is very dislocated and for me as a woman traveling by herself not in an area I wanted to stay. Staff was quite caring and tried to find a way for me feeling more comfortable. I would say the price is okay. hotel also. when traveling with a friend or a partner and the dislocation is not the problem it is an good option to stay for little money.,Very nice breakfast and helpful staff. Nice rooms.

Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Mary,Italy,2 Reviews,August 31  2017,8.3,The only thing that concerned me was the location. next to an industrial area and petrol station where drunks and homeless people were gathered constantly.

Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Vicky,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 23  2017,10,That I couldn't stay longer and enjoy it more,The evening shift staff went out of there way and yet they probably didn't.  It was just their every day normal The outside is a little rough but when you walk in you are propelled in to Best Western Land.  The quiet charm of an upscale hotel in the round.  Well appointed rooms that lack nothing except stress.  Comfotable rooms and tremendous amount of space.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Jolana,Belgium,1 review,August 20  2017,4.6,The shuttle bus service.,The hotel needs to invest in double. if not tripple. glazing. The noise at night prevents from a good night rest! Moreover. I was disappointed by the hotel's surroundings -There are drug adicts and drunk people in the streets around the hotel throughout the day. and adding to the noise at night. Finally. the hotel does not accept payment with MAESTRO card. which is not serious as local ATMs accept it without problem.

Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Susan,United Kingdom,1 review,July 18  2017,4.6,Please BEWARE of this hotel!!!! I recently stayed here for 2 nights. I can't complain about the hotel itself as our room was nice. It's when you leave!!! We booked through booking.com and used our debit card to secure the room. On check out we asked if we could settle using our Fair Fx card (pre paid dollar card) the girl took our payment and gave us our receipt which I was happy with as it was the correct amount of â‚¬448 and stated that amount and my card details. A couple of days later I checked my statement and to my surprise what had been taken was â‚¬1643.17!! That's not all. they had also taken â‚¬448 from my debit card AND also â‚¬448 from our credit card we used for them to hold when we checked in! As soon as I realised this I called the hotel and spoke to the girl that took the payment. she promised to arrange a refund but told me it would take 2 weeks!!!! This was devastating as this was money we had loaded on our card for our holiday and we were over â‚¬1600 short on spending money. I called the hotel a further 3 times and still got nowhere. Our holiday was ruined by this hotel and we had to cancel some stuff we had planned for our holiday! When we returned home there was still no refund. I sent an email to head office and received the refund on our Fair FX card I didn't even receive an email apologising or to advise me this had been done!! I also received a refund on our debit card for Â£4 less!! I did NOT want to pay for this hotel using our credit card but they took it without our consent and we have also been charged Â£22 for a non sterling transaction fee! All in this hotel took over Â£2.000 spread across our 3 cards and I have have never even received an apology or an explanation OR our money back for the transaction fees!!! SHOCKING SERVICE!!!!,Room was nice

Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Kenneth,United States of America,1 review,June 9  2017,7.9,Noisy at times.

Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,April 19  2017,5.4,The location was terrible- a lot of homeless and drunk/drugged people within 50 ft. It's located in an industrial area of the city and the noise at night was awful- the facility even supplies earplugs in the room! Not a good sign when you want to sleep and relax.  If we didn't accidentally booked a non-refundable room we would have found another place. There is nothing around so you have to get a cab into the city. and I wouldn't have felt safe walking anywhere near the hotel.,The staff was very friendly.

Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Jarmo,Finland,1 review,April 13  2017,4.2,Shower only had burning hot water or super lousy water pressure. pick one. The area was surrounded by hobos. industrial noise and a hospital so 24 hour sirens and ghetto arguing on the street. There was no restaurant or a bar in the hotel. There was no minibar either so you had to walk about 10 minutes to a 7-eleven for a beer. while surrounded by dodgy people. The shuttle that took you to center and back left me standing on the street on one occasion: The driver didn't pull over but let someone out on the far left lane on the street.  It was never on time either and the drivers were pretty inarticulate. except for one latino man who was fun and helpful as well. The minivan doesn't bear any logos or nothing so you just have to spot a grey van with Florida plates among all the other grey vans. There was a fire alarm in the middle of the night. an evacuation and firefighters caused by a system failure. Had I been paying my self for the stay. I would've stayed in the hostel downtown for a tiny fraction of the price.,The king size bed was superb and I got online quite well. The breakfast wasn't half bad. although 6 days of the same was a little on the too familiar side.

(homeless people) Trash Very noisy spot in an industrial area."They do provide ear plugs",There breakfast and breakfast staff were one of the best we a have had in a BWThe front desk staff was very polite and helpful with our questions and at check in and check out.It is close to the strain stop for the red line and they do provide a shuttle.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Richard,United States of America,4 Reviews,March 25  2017,7.9,The area where the hotel was located was full of addicts who were everywhere( Methadone Mile). I was very disappointed about the number of individuals dealing with this issue and felt somewhat unsafe in this area. I was  always on the lookout for dangers associated with those in this lifestyle.,N/A

Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Nadia,Canada,2 Reviews,March 21  2017,9.2,Sounds from outside. They had left is ear plugs on the night stand. I  understood why after the first night. I had put some whitenoise on my phone and slept like a baby.The pull out couch was as practical as it could be. I suggest asking for a couple extra blanketa to put on the mattress so you don't feel the springs as much.,Room was very clean and modern. Bathroom was wonderful. Clean and new.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Sarah,United States of America,1 review,March 20  2017,9.6,I wish the hotel had been located nearer to the conference I was attending. but even that wasn't too bad. About 1 mile from the Hynes convention center. A 20-25 minute walk.,The staff was very helpful and friendly. They always were making sure to assist me in my requests (taxi. directions. food).

Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Dave,United States of America,1 review,March 14  2017,3.8,Room smelled terrible when we checked in. as if someone had been chain smoking the whole week before. Staff tried charging me a fee for smoking because of this. even tho it was a previous guest. I eventually yelled enough to get the fee removed. but the cost was still $20 over what I was quoted on this site.,The muffins were okay.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,MartinMUK,United Kingdom,15 Reviews,March 13  2017,6.7,When I first arrived. I was given a room which was unclean (after the receptionist rubbed me up the wrong way by - bluntly - telling me I would need to grab a baggage carousel (60kg of luggage) and do it myself) but this got resolved.Now that I've had time to reflect. I'd say that this is for those on a budget or those in town for business. If you want a comprehensive service. this isn't the place for you. If you want. for the most part. friendly enough staff. an adequate place to sleep. get food. and then saunter off to do whatever then this property is adequate.,The room size was adequate. the bed was comfortable. and the receptionist resolved an issue with the room I was originally given (it was dirty) quickly and efficiently.If you're on a budget and/or willing to compromise on silver spoon service then this place is a good shout. As an aside. make sure you CLEARLY state the FULL address to a taxi driver (or just use Uber/Lift/whatever app) as I got taken for a ride (literally) by a cabbie that was pushing his luck and trying (unsuccessfully I might add) to milk the 'naive Brit. tourist'.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Jennifer,United States of America,1 review,March 13  2017,6.3,The location was really bad.  It is RIGHT near the hospital. and the noise all night was rough.  The hotel even gave guests "sleepytime tea" and earplugs.  There is a McDonalds across the street. and it is in a depressed neighborhood.  There were people dealing drugs and a man literally peeing and messing himself in the restaurant.  I was afraid for my safety.,The room was dated. but comfortable.  The staff were very kind and helpful.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Patty,United States of America,2 Reviews,March 9  2017,9.2,The bathtub needed to be cleaned better. the corners of the tub ledge were dirty. Room needs to be high dusted (top of headboards) very dusty. I was an Executive Housekeeper and this was always a pet peeve.,Room as very comfortable. noise from outside is awful but earplugs helpful.  Free breakfast is very nice and very clean area. Attendant very pleasant.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Jorge,Canada,1 review,February 22  2017,7.5,The staff at the front desk  is always in bad attitude and you should training to welcome and smiling. and they have have good face. they look like they hate this  job.,The room is nice and breakfast is good.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,William,United States of America,1 review,February 19  2017,7.5,The area of the hotel is absolutely awful. There were several homelesspeople/bums directly across the street with many walking by while wewere outside. Also. because of the proximity. we had a homeless personobviously on meth. weaving and bobbing all over the breakfast areastuffing her pockets with food. Was not pleased that this person wasable to get into the hotel. Also. called from Bringham's for ashuttle at 8:50 pm. phone rang with no answer several times with noanswer. Finally answered. and told me shuttle was already on his wayshould be 5 minutes. When no pick up. we called again (phone rang withno answer &amp; we had to call back 2 times to get someone to pick up).Asked what was going on with shuttle and told not sure they will callhim again. I asked them to call me right back to tell me eta of shuttleas we were outside! No return call and shuttle did not come till 9:30pm.Lack of communication was very frustrating. On Sunday. a samaritan had afood table set up across the street which brought every homeless personfor miles directly across the street. I would say this is the biggestdrawback of this hotel. Also. if you are a light sleeper...forget itbecause police sirens rang out about every hour thru the night. Sorry.but these are the true facts and should be a consideration in yourdecision to stay. Shuttle service was the reason we chose this hotel andoverall. that was a positive. It's a shame it is located in such aterrible area.,The room was clean and the staff was pretty much excellent. Thestaff in the breakfast area were amazing. kind. helpful and very ontop of the area.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Josh,Canada,1 review,February 17  2017,9.6,The only thing I would say is that they need better parking area.,Room was beautiful staff were friendly and their waffles are fantastic. their whole breakfast selection was great. Would deffinately stay there again.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Amy,United States of America,1 review,February 16  2017,3.8,When my partner and I arrived. you couldn't hear anything in the lobby because construction going on in the hotel. We were given our room key. arrive to our room . it was a complete mess. towels every where. the bed not made and the tv on! I go back downstairs and tell them the room was not cleaned and someone may be in there. We waited 15-20 minutes to get a new room since the hotel attendant was not sure what rooms were available. Which does not make any sense to me due to the fact the hotel was small and he did not have much help or support.,Our new room was clean and bed was comfy.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Dannielle,United States of America,1 review,February 8  2017,8.8,The location is a little iffy. the outside of the building is a little off looking compared to how the inside is. I think the outside of the building needs a little updating and could use a little work. The breakfast was honestly kinda gross. think it could've been a lot better. The eggs tasted very weird and the bacon wasn't crispy at all.,I loved the room and the bed. The place was amazing and we had a wonderful stay.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Nikolett,United States of America,1 review,February 6  2017,5.8,We checked in on 2/4/2017 around 6 pm. The receptionist girl was horrible. No smile. no kindness she looked like she hate her job. That's fine but not as a front desk receptionist . When your main duty is to smile and welcome the guests that's unacceptable.,Always clean. and comfortable for a good price.
Best Western Plus Boston Hotel,Anonymous,Finland,1 review,February 6  2017,7.1,Was a little bit difficult to get there by public transport late in the evening (but not far from central or airport to take taxi).

Bluebird Suites at Garrison Square,Stefano,Italy,10 Reviews,September 19  2017,3.3,There is not a lobby. 2 days before check-in they send you a mail with the instructions to get the key in a look outside the building. The room was in a different building and I had wrong instructions to go there. I spent an half hour to find the right doar.In the apartment I found only one bathroom. but I had a reservation for an apartment with two bathrooms. and I paid more for it.Immediately I wrote a mail to the manager but he answered me only after my check out.There were not enough blanket for the beds and there were not a cleaning service. So so so bad!,Near to Copley Square
Bluebird Suites at Garrison Square,Joan,Australia,13 Reviews,August 7  2017,7.1,There are several blocks in his complex. Access instructions were incorrect and it took a long time. with the help of the complex manager to sort it out - he does not work for the company leasing the property and had no obligations to us so we were very grateful for his help.  We are from Australia and didn't have a local phone to contact Global Apartments so the manager lent us his phone! The apartment in the advertisement is different to what we were given - this is false advertising.  There is no roof top garden in the block our apartment was in. again this is false advertising. The rooftop had air conditioning units and nothing else. When we arrived the dining table had been set for 2 people complete with a salt and pepper pot - but no salt and pepper! Travellers from overseas don't always have salt and pepper with them and it's always been provided in other apartments we have stayed in - they did provide 2 measley tea bags and 2 coffee sachets!  We were only supplied one set of keys. this was very inconvenient.  I sent several emails via Booking.com to Global but didn't get a reply until our second last day and they didn't address the issues.  Bathroom is in need of renovation. the bath has been painted and looks terrible.,Location was great. apartment was comfortable. bedrooms were spacious and windows could be opened for fresh air - a real bonus.
Bluebird Suites at Garrison Square,Maneesh,Bahrain,10 Reviews,July 22  2017,7.9,The apartment number and wifi access details provided to us were wrong so we struggled to find our apartment without any help as there was no-one on sight. When we called the customer service we were told its Friday night outside office hours so someone will get in touch with us when available which was not helpful when we are unable to enter our apartment after a long trip.,All arrangements were well planned
Bluebird Suites at Garrison Square,Eyad,Canada,2 Reviews,July 13  2017,4.6,I have to say this was the most disappointing stay I have ever encountered. and I have been around the world. We arrived to the property at 6PM and I had no idea how to enter the apartment because the host did not send me the instructions. I went to speak to the office owning the property and they gave me numbers to call and no one was answering. I waited with my family trying to call 3 different numbers without luck until the owners felt sorry for us (especially that I had young kids with me who were extremely tired) and gave us access to the apartment. On top of that. I tried to call again to extend my stay for an extra night. no one would pick up the phone. Although their working hours clearly states from 9 to 5. I tried calling the next day from 9 to 10 AM repeatedly without luck. Every time I think someone is about to talk to me I get put on hold and then the call gets disconnected. I finally dialed the emergency number and left a message with the lady that picked up to know if I can stay or not since my check-out was going to be in less than an hour. To add to this. the sofa bed available in the apartment was absolutely disgusting with yellow spots everywhere on it. Overall. terrible experience I would not recommend this property at all.,Location is great
Bluebird Suites at Garrison Square,Jj,United States of America,1 review,July 10  2017,5.8,I was not able to get a hold of anybody (phone call or by email) to find out if we were able to get in early the morning of our stay so we ended up paying for an early check in of 1:00 pm. but didn't even go back to the apartment until 3:00 pm (we didn't want to waste our day waiting around if we couldn't drop our stuff off). Paperwork had us listed in Building B. but we were actually in C and we went into three buildings before we found the right one. When we asked someone on site for some help. he was incredibly rude and short with us. which made us even more frustrated. Apartment itself was great; lots of room for 5 guests. nice wood floors and a great kitchen. Couches were a little uncomfortable to sit on after a long day of walking around Boston. but we didn't spend much time there so that didn't really bother us all that much. We were also only left with one roll of toilet paper for all us and my husband had to go the store at 11:00 pm at night to get more. Bathroom could definitely use an update; tub and floor were dirty and the sink wouldn't drain properly. For $400 a night. I expected the place to be immaculate. but maybe that's what you get in the city. Instructions on specifics for what do when leaving were really vague so I don't even know if we did everything we were supposed to when we left.,Apartment was in a great area and was easy to get to. lots of space for 5 guests.
Bluebird Suites at Garrison Square,Ian,United Kingdom,1 review,April 8  2017,9.2,Unfortunately the WiFi didn't work. Was fixed by the end of our 2nd day. but as we were only there 3 days it meant we had no WiFi for 2/3 of the time.,Well appointed apartment. Clean and comfortable.

Westin Boston Waterfront,Maria,United States of America,1 review,October 30  2017,6.5,I requested late check out twice over the phone. I was told because I booked my rooms via Booking. com. I need to request the late check out when I check in and depends on availability. When I checked in I requested late check out they told me to check the day after because they were very busy and depends on availability. even though two of my friends who did not book via Booking.com got the late check out with no issue. The room Service did not exist. Twice I requested stuff that I never got!!! A room for 4 people had only three towels. In the morning I requested towels that never arrived I had to get them myself from the cleaning crew!!!! Each Room had complimentary parking for one car. The parking manager told us we need to pay. everyone has pay Guest or not Guest. The parking drama was outrageous!! never again. The so called parking manager would not admit to anything he stated.,The bed only....
Westin Boston Waterfront,Karen,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 16  2017,10,They need more towel racks.,Our room was very clean. with great view of city skyline. Loved the shower!! Close walking distance to the harbor and lots of attractions nearby.
Westin Boston Waterfront,Julieta,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 15  2017,8.8,The bathroom in the room was outdated compared to the lobby and common areas.Price was quite high.,The meeting was at the hotel. sÃ³ location was very convenient.
Westin Boston Waterfront,Peter,Australia,1 review,October 13  2017,9.6,Irish pub in hotel had below average food but was otherwise a fun place. Food did't fit with high standard of hotel. I know it is somewhat independent but it did have room charge so it does reflect on the otherwise high standards of the hotel.,Concierge desk was super helpful and went beyond the call to help me find a particular item in Boston. Special shout out to Colleen (an absolute angel) with help from Ellen in that pursuit. Made me feel like had real friends at the Westin - please pass on that feedback. Also. the room was great. loved the shower contraption and the food from the main in-house restaurants was great. Best mussels ever! You can't ask for better regarding proximity to conference center of course. but it comes at a really high price.Thanks for a really great stay! Peter
Westin Boston Waterfront,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 2  2017,3.3,Service was bad. Tv didnt work. we got a room with no balcony. We booked a room with a waterfront view and got nothing. Rooms were too small. Breakfast was supposed to be included and we got charged. We paid 500 dollars for one night and everything was awful. For that kind of money my wife and I would of got treated like a king and queen anywhere else. Dinner was bad too.,Breakfast was awful. Tasted bad
Westin Boston Waterfront,Wesley,United States of America,1 review,September 30  2017,8.8,I always prefer a stand-up shower to a tub. but the bathroom was clean and well-stocked so I'm not picky about that.,The room I had this time had a spectacular view. actually.  Also. that Westin has always been extremely low drama on the check-in check-out phases.
Westin Boston Waterfront,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 25  2017,10,No complains,Wonderful stay! Staff was friendly with excellent service. They welcome our children with welcome bags including water bottles and Boston related booms. Easy walk to attractions but in a quieter area which was nice with 2 small children. Would definitely stay again!

Westin Boston Waterfront,Joan,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 16  2017,6.3,Check in was supposed to be at 3:00pm. we arrived at 3:47pm and the room was not ready. We asked for a time line and were told when housekeeping gets done. no idea when. It wasn't ready until almost 5pm. Messed up our whole afternoon.,The best part about this hotel is the location. We also loved the Irish restaurant on site.

Westin Boston Waterfront,Jaime,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 22  2017,9.2,The term "waterfront " was a bit of a stretch. The VIEW of the waterfront in the distance and city scape was pretty.,The hotel was very beautiful and sparkling clean. The elevators had to be the fastest I've ever been on! We blinked and were on the 12th floor. The crib we requested was brought up immediately and was perfect for our little one. We let him crawl everywhere because the place looked impeccable!
Westin Boston Waterfront,Julie,United Kingdom,12 Reviews,July 2  2017,9.2,A little pricier than anticipated.,Swimming pool was lovely.

I was told I could not do that and It would cost me additional $390.00 for 2nd might. I paid $219.00 the first night. plus $36.00 per night for parking. I fly that I was being overcharged.

Westin Boston Waterfront,LiaHaikal,Indonesia,13 Reviews,April 28  2017,5.4,The staff were unfriendly. except for the ladies at the giftshop. I'm a member and was told that I got free internet. but the hotel staff at the reception didn't give me the info for the internet (password etc). I was hesitant to ask because most of the staf there are cold and somewhat snob-ish. On the last day we put our luggages at the hotel after we check-out bcs we needed to go somewhere. when we got our luggages back. one of them broke(it got some cracked on the side of it)!,Big room comfy bed
Westin Boston Waterfront,Kevin,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 17  2017,8.3,Very disappointed in the breakfast buffet.  Traveled with family of 4 and each of us had multiple things on our plate that we didn't like.Second batch of powdered eggs weren't mixed fully so they had a terrible chalky consistency.Hotel was a little too far from the sites I wanted to see. stayed here because of price but in the future would stay closer to Boston Common.,Hotel itself is nice. staff was great.  pool and gym were very clean and modern.  liked having a full Starbucks in the lobby.I had booked two nights but at separate times. staff was able to keep me in the same room for both nights. I appreciated that.

Westin Boston Waterfront,Ls,United States of America,1 review,January 2  2017,2.5,At check in he told me I had no reservation.  Made me wait at least gen minutes and showing him numerous emails . etc before he realized he put my last name first.  Second incidence was the fact there system was declining my cards until the computer was rebooted so check in took almost 30 min as he put the phone on speaker playing the wait music to call merchant services. rude.  I went ahead and called my bank only to be told they couldn't even see it attempted to be run on their end therefore it was there system error. It took so long my fiancÃ© who was in the car called to check on me.  No explanation of wifi . amenities. or how to even get to the room.  Better yet no apologies for anything! Once to the room the bed was stripped with all the pillows. comforter. sheets thrown all over.  Call down to have room switched took 15 min only to be moved across the hall in room with no city view which is what I booked. however we were already running behind due to the prior so I couldn't call to wait even more for a correction.,There really was not a positive from start to finish it was a very unpleasant experience.

Westin Boston Waterfront,Cara,United States of America,1 review,October 17  2016,8.3,Room was not worth $700+. I paid $700 for a suite in Midtown Manhattan overlooking Bryant Park. This room was very nice. however $400 would have been more reasonable.,N/A
Westin Boston Waterfront,Michal,Poland,5 Reviews,September 3  2016,8.8,Swimming pool much smaller than it appears on the pictures. breakfast variety could be at the higher level,Outstanding location. helpful staff and Starbucks downstairs near the reception:)
Westin Boston Waterfront,Jean-rÃ©mi,France,1 review,August 27  2016,6.3,Many surprising elements in an hotel of this standard: no free wifi access. bathtube not deep enough to take a bath. bad sound isolation.,Very good breakfast buffet and location for a business trip
Westin Boston Waterfront,comeflywithme,Canada,6 Reviews,August 12  2016,8.8,Would have preferred to be more central but hotel itself is very. very nice and staff are fantastic.,Hotel is gorgeous and close to the Seaport District (lots of restaurants along the water) and Children's Museum. It's about a 20 minute walk to Boston Common/downtown Boston. But it's a fairly easy walk- no major roads or hills to cross. If you don't mind a bit of a walk to get to centre of Boston it's a very nice hotel.
Westin Boston Waterfront,Awi,Singapore,1 review,August 11  2016,9.2,I was expecting to have waterfront view room but that was not I got.,The staff that assisted me upon checkin was very courteous and accomodating.  Facilities are good.
Westin Boston Waterfront,Anonymous,United States of America,8 Reviews,August 2  2016,6.7,Pillows were ( for me) uncomfortable - don't like or use foam - too soft and get warm. Had a tough time getting to sleep.,bed( mattress) was very comfortable. comforter was terrific after the room cooled off duri ng the night; would have liked a sheet for earlier.
Westin Boston Waterfront,Christie,United States of America,1 review,July 26  2016,6.7,Every thing cost extra. We also stayed at $149 hotel on this trip that had better shower water pressure and free breakfast. wi-fi and just as clean and comfy too.,No free wi-fi or complimentary breakfast. Everything was an additional cost except for water. Small bathroom. Overpriced for whT you get. but you pay for the convenient location to all downtown.
Westin Boston Waterfront,Cynthia,United States of America,1 review,July 18  2016,8.3,We have a family of 5 and wanted a cot for one of the kids. as the only option was two double beds or a King. Due to fire code they wouldn't give us a cot. so one had to sleep on the floor! Not expected or ideal. I had pre booked and requested a cot online and on the phone to let them know we were running late but hold our room. No mention of the policy until checkin.  ğŸ˜¤,Beautiful lobby area with a bar and a Starbucks. Restaurant attached with good food and service. Good view of Boston from the room.
Westin Boston Waterfront,Carrie,United States of America,1 review,July 13  2016,7.9,The price was high.,Bed was very comfortable. The room was very nice. good size and very clean. The bar/restaurant was good. too! The view of the city was fantastic!

Westin Boston Waterfront,Loveboston!,United States of America,4 Reviews,July 2  2016,9.6,I loved our hotel but it was a little far to walk to other sites in town.  The parking was somewhat isolated particularly the first day we were there and barely found a spot at 9 pm when we arrived.,I enjoyed working out in the fitness room and the pool was nice. but a little cooler than I thought it would be. Starbucks was convenient and quick. Loved the food at the onsite pub. The hotel offers a lot for the price.
Westin Boston Waterfront,Kristin,United States of America,1 review,June 19  2016,7.1,Very loud in the hallways at night and early morning.Parking for $46 as a guest for 1 night is ridiculous.  It would have been cheaper to get a parking ticket.,N/A
Westin Boston Waterfront,Tyler,United States of America,1 review,June 14  2016,7.1,The room was small and everything seemed a little too expensive for what i was getting in return,The bed was amazing it was very soft. The grounds were clean. And the staff was nice.
Westin Boston Waterfront,Mom,United States of America,1 review,June 6  2016,9.6,Good was a little high priced. Paying for parking was a bummer.,The staff was so welcoming.  My little ones got a gift bag with 2 Boston themed books and a water bottle for each. They were so friendly and greeted us warmly everyday.  My son got high fives and hey buddy from all the staff. Loved staying and would stay again.
Westin Boston Waterfront,Kathy,United States of America,14 Reviews,June 1  2016,7.9,Noise but that was not the hotels fault. Otherwise fine.,Staff took action after there was an issue with noise. Compensation by validation of parking. I thought that was very gracious and they were very apologetic.
Westin Boston Waterfront,Bda,United States of America,1 review,May 31  2016,10,Lobby can get really noisy.Garage not equally well lit. Underground garage had strong smell of fumes. Giant exhaust fans were visible but perhaps the garage could use power washing.,Dining/meal options for different times of the day -- Starbucks. Sauciety (awesome breakfast buffet). the Bar and MJ OConnors. Ample conference facilities. Very clean room. Restaurant staff were solicitous.
Westin Boston Waterfront,Francis,Zimbabwe,11 Reviews,May 30  2016,8.3,1. Business centre lady was unfriendly and appeared to be enjoying her computer than serving me2. When I made my booking through BOOKING COM I made special requests. Hotel did not advise me in time that they could not meet my special requests. Worse still Hotel check in staff initially tried to lie to me that they had NOT seen the requests. But when they said I had booked inter joining rooms I then told them that this was part of my special requests. And so they had all my special requests. In future hotel should advise its customers well in advance if it cannot meet customers' needs.,Coinceirge staff were excellent
Westin Boston Waterfront,Natalie,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 28  2016,9.0,The side table was torn off wall and the drapes were also hanging off the wall.,Loved the shower. make-up mirror and extra pillows on bed. Also the fridge and safe.
Westin Boston Waterfront,Timothy,United States of America,1 review,May 25  2016,9.6,The breakfast was expensive so the breakfast buffet was better. but 24.95 each was a bit much. The parking overnight was 48.00. These two options added over $100 to the bill.,The room was large and comfortable. The bed and pillows were great. The staff and bell boys were quick and pleasant. The food was good.  The valet parking was very convenient. Out choice for this location was the close proximity to the Holland America Cruise Terminal.
Westin Boston Waterfront,Max15,United Kingdom,1 review,May 24  2016,7.1,I meant to book a different Westin in Boston but somehow got this one. My mistake but be aware there are three Westins in very different locations in the city. This one is near the Waterfront so a bit more of a walk into town. Big. busy and anonymous hotel which per se isn't a criticism but if you're looking for the personal touch you won't get it here.  Pricey restaurants on site as expected. NO FREE WIFI apart from half hour slots in the lobby. Big money maker for the hotel but a bit cheeky really to charge $12.99 per 24 hours.,Very comfy bed. nice big bathroom. Decent hairdryer too. Close to the World Trade Centre station where we bought Charlie tickets to hop on and off buses and the subway. Near enough (5-10 min stroll) to some excellent restaurants. Legal Seafood and pizza places.
Westin Boston Waterfront,Lisa,United States of America,5 Reviews,May 18  2016,7.1,Even though I requested a wheelchair in advance. I waited outside the hotel for 20 minutes while they located one.

Westin Boston Waterfront,Bradford,United States of America,1 review,April 26  2016,7.9,The wifi is not free.  Price is way up there. and adding parking on top is kind of insulting.,Was very nice to be close to the BCEC. of course.  Room was spacious with a great bed.
Westin Boston Waterfront,Paul,New Zealand,11 Reviews,March 29  2016,7.5,N/A,Hotel is big. vast and has no atmosphere. There is a nice bar. Starbucks and Irish pub but seamed lacking in eateries and bars for it size! Also along way from any other bars or restaruants. Over all it was a plesant stay.
Westin Boston Waterfront,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,March 22  2016,9.2,It was a little pricey for what ended up being just a bed for the night. If I had taken advantage of the rest of the hotel's facilities and amenities I think it would have been more worth it.,Nice view of the city.Great facilities. Clean room.Friendly staff.Starbucks.
Westin Boston Waterfront,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,February 29  2016,9.6,N/A,Very clean. staff was professional and friendly. beautiful Boston skyline and waterfront views. very convenient to MJ OConnors and Laugh Boston and a great breakfast at Society.

And. of course. we loved the comfort of the Heavenly Bed!
Westin Boston Waterfront,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,December 7  2015,9.2,We were really looking forward to using the hot tub.  Unfortunately. the hot tub was closed for repairs. and we were not made aware of its unavailability until we went to use it.,Comfortable. quiet. spacious room with nice shower.
Westin Boston Waterfront,Stephanie,United States of America,1 review,November 10  2015,10,When we called the desk about the room not being cleaned we had to go back down to the lobby to get a new room. When this happened to me in the past the staff told me my new room number and met me there with my new keys,I was checked in very quickly.  When we entered our room we saw it was not cleaned after the last guest.  It was corrected quickly Outstanding facility bed. food and service !

Two-Bedroom on Hamilton Place Apt 401,Jim,Australia,1 review,September 12  2017,3.8,Two weeks at $350/night and no cleaning service or linen change during that period. When I enquired I was told I would have to pay extra for cleaning. The beds and linen were poor quality and lined with polyurethane under the sheets. this makes them extremely hot. unpleasant and uncomfortable. Definitely not a good idea if you have babies/toddlers to leave them lying face down on them. The location in downtown Boston is good. but the end of the small road it is on is the place a lot of people hang out and beg for money. At times it can feel a little unsafe though there are always police around. Definitely not good value for me and Sonder did not live up to the promise of its website and advertising. Won't be using them again.,Washing machine and dryer worked well
Two-Bedroom on Hamilton Place Apt 401,Michael,Ireland,5 Reviews,July 4  2017,9.6,Maybe a safe for passports. But not a big deal as apartment property was well supervised,I don't want anyone to find this apartment as its perfect and I want to keep it for myselfThe location was excellent. A stones throw from Boston CommonThe apartment was spacious with two good sized bedrooms. lovely kitchen with washing machine and drier. Excellent wifi. On a quiet cul de sac street. so no road noiseOnly put good on hosts as did not get to meet them. you collect keys from lockbox.Value for money. probably the same price as a hotel but then we were there for week up to July 4th Holiday so all accommodation was at a premium in generalBut the apartment is perfect as you have more freedom and space. where you can eat in or out as you choosePlace was so nice. my wife said it would be great to own it. When we revisit Boston this is where I will be looking to stay.
Two-Bedroom on Hamilton Place Apt 401,Heidi,United States of America,1 review,October 24  2017,10,Nothing,Accommodations were very clean. amenities were provided. beds were super comfortable and location could not have been any better.
Evolve Park Lane Seaport,Anonymous,United States of America,6 Reviews,October 11  2017,3.8,No air conditioner that works. no manager to help us out. not very clean etc. etc,The location was great but the rest of it a big disappointment. We will never want to go back
Evolve Park Lane Seaport,Micahel,United States of America,1 review,October 2  2017,4.6,The host/ management of the property are not organized. It is a third party that are very hard to get a hold of. In the email of confirmation. it said to call before hand to pick up keys. but the number didn't work. When we arrived and got to the apartment. the concierge man. was very rude and stated "They never know what they are doing." Referring to the management group. Northeast suites. Then when we got to the room. I emailed the customer service rep. Michelle Leonard. who was very prompt in getting back to me. about not having any blanket or pillow for the pull out sofa bed. however. when she reached out the "field staff" named Tyler. nothing was done and I was not contacted again. Unfortunately. this is a customer service industry. and the customer service was none existent from this company. Needless to say. I will not be using them again. Plus. it was $75.00 to park in the garage for two days. which I thought was slightly ridiculous.,The one good thing about this location. is the location.
Evolve Park Lane Seaport,Kevin,United States of America,1 review,September 29  2017,9.6,There were dark hairs in my bed. And I did not receive my email with a pick of an amenities basket until the day of my arrival. Other than that it was a perfect property. I would rent it again.,The property was so close to great restaurants. CVS pharmacy. Convention center. etc. Great place for everything i needed.

One-Bedroom on Brookline Avenue Apt 834,Karen,United States of America,1 review,June 3  2017,8.8,The bed was a bit on the hard side. More relevant. we booked this for three people. but the sofa bed/futon was terrible; our teenager was pretty miserable trying to sleep on it.,The location was great; easy access to the T. shopping. and restaurants. Attractive building with an attentive door staff. nice fitness room and common areas. Spacious. modern. well-stocked apartment with room to spread out.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Cynthia,Canada,2 Reviews,November 1  2017,7.9,Unfortunately our room looked out to a back alley area with industrial piping/radiators.,Lovely hotel with an old world elegance and an excellent front desk staff. The room was well-appointed. very clean with marble bathroom and comfortable bed.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Jillian,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 31  2017,9.6,Bathroom was a bit small for the room.,The attitude of the staff. in particular in reception - the helpfulness of everyone including the housekeeping staff.  We liked being in the location. it wasd expensive for Brits like us. but we knew it would be and set us up well for a much longer tour of New England with significantly poorer accommodation!  I would happily have stayed a week if finances would have allowed.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Jill,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 30  2017,6.7,Management was terrible.,Everything was great except that the shower was so tiny that it was not possible to even wash your hair without banging your elbows....management could t have been less concerned or solutio oriented....for the price stay at the Liberty
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Michelle,South Africa,17 Reviews,October 29  2017,9.6,N/A,Loved the welcoming staff and whole feel of the hotel. Old world charm. Close walk to subway and shops. Room was outstanding - but sadly looked into a brick wall.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 25  2017,7.5,There were no areas to sit other than the room or restaurant.  Would be good to have somewhere to make a cup of tea. Bed was a little soft.  Some of staff seemed to start a conversation then fail to continue it,Some of staff were very friendly. Pillows were great
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Jeremy,United Kingdom,22 Reviews,October 18  2017,10,Shower space rather limited (neither of us is very large).,Efficient friendly and welcoming staff achieving just the right balance  in their attitude. Lovely room. Well equipped. clean and fit for purpose.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Bettina,Canada,2 Reviews,October 16  2017,10,The only thing that could be improved upon is the lighting in the bathroom. It was a little difficult for us ladies to apply our daily war paint:-),We absolutely loved the kind and efficient staff. Each and every one from the front desk to the elevator man to the doorman to the bell hop were all kind and a pleasure to deal with each day.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Anonymous,Australia,6 Reviews,October 16  2017,8.3,It is a little run-down . One day they forgot to clean my room and breakfast was ordinary.,The hotel is well-located in Back Bay. has very spacious rooms and the décor is pleasant.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Nia,United Kingdom,1 review,October 14  2017,10,Nothing.,Comfiest bed I've ever slept in it was massive.

The Eliot Suite Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 9  2017,9.6,N/A,Terrific location. Our room was spacious and luxurious. as we arranged for their largest suite. We didn't eat breakfast there. but it was on option at their attached restaurant Uni.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Austin,United Kingdom,18 Reviews,October 9  2017,9.6,A kettle in the room!,Excellent location in an interesting area of Boston. Bus &amp; subway very close; cafes and restaurants within easy walking distance. Staff very friendly &amp; helpful.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Alice,United States of America,1 review,October 8  2017,9.2,There was no fridge and no way to make a real cup of tea (Keurig might work for serviceable coffee; it fails utterly at tea). The continental breakfast offerings. though nicely arranged. were nothing special (though there was Special K...)--certainly not what you'd expect in that sort of hotel.,We loved the unexpected touches--a handsomely packed bag of cookies left in our room after we had stepped out for a few hours. a bucket of ice delivered unbidden in the evening. The living area was spacious. the closet huge.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Lyn,Australia,6 Reviews,October 1  2017,10,N/A,The service was amazing! From the moment we arrived by taxi. we were greeted immediately and our luggage carried inside! The staff at reception were friendly and efficient! Our suite was ready for us even though we arrived early! Our suite was beautiful. roomy. clean and the bed was extra comfy!! The Japanese restaurant attached to the hotel provided a wonderful experience with an interesting menu and wine/cocktail list. Food was fabulous!
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Perceptive,Australia,7 Reviews,September 29  2017,9.2,The canopies above the beds seems rather claustrophobic and unnecessary. Our air conditioner was very loud. The double window system was problematic to open just slightly to allow some fresh air into the room. Do not attempt to do it yourself. We had excellent help but it still closed itself down again.  So we had to rely on the air conditioner. The system was inside the room itself so we could turn it off and on but I cannot see how it could be made quieter. As with all rooms we had in four cities not one had a central light. One relies on a series of lamps. Light was not too bad in our particular room. The lamps just did the job.  The windows are heavily curtained as well so not a huge amount of daylight either.,There is an excellent Japanese fusion restaurant in the building. It was also the venue for breakfast which was good value. The staff bend over backwards to be helpful. although at times there seem to be too many about. The beds were plush and we had a good functional bathroom. a good ironing setup and plenty of hanging space. Close to other restaurants and within walking distance to Copley Place. Do a tour of the library. old and new. Walk across the bridge on Massachusetts Ave to the MIT and Harvard precincts.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Amy,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 29  2017,10,N/A,Property was easy to find. staff was very friendly. they gave us a complimentary upgrade to a larger room. location was easy walking distance to Fenway. shopping.

The Eliot Suite Hotel,Caroline,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,September 17  2017,9.6,The rooms are a bit dated.,The staff were super friendly and helpful. Sandeep organised our city tour and booked us great tickets to see the baseball. Location was excellent.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Rhonda,United States of America,1 review,September 13  2017,10,The bathroom was very small with no counter space.,We were upgraded to a mini suite. which was wonderful. I picked the location to be by Newbury Street. which has shops and sidewalk cafes. I didn't realize Bolyston.which is also in walking distance. has several great eateries. Plus the Prudential Center is close with shops and more. The area is a combination of shops. restaurants. and apartments. We always felt safe walking to eat. etc.  The staff at the hotel were friendly and very accommodating. We stayed several days and loved it!!!!
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,September 10  2017,5.0,see above. poor room and lack of facilities.,the hotel was well placed. reasonably clean and the staff friendly.  However. the room they offered us was tiny and dark.  They were eventually able to move us for the second night to a better room.  But it should be made clear that this is not an all suites hotel. and some of the rooms are substandard.  There are no facilities at all. not even a lounge. and no breakfast.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Patricia,United States of America,5 Reviews,September 7  2017,9.6,N/A,The staff at the Eliot were all so friendly. from the reception desk to the valets. Plus. we really appreciated the emails welcoming us in advance and making sure we had directions. And how can you beat a location a block away from Newbury Street?
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Charlotte,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,September 4  2017,9.6,The noise of the lift from the bedroom but I guess this is because it's an older building.,The staff really went out of their way to make our stay special for a special occasion. The gym facilities were fantastic.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 31  2017,5.8,the hotel has gotten shabby. AC did not work well in the summer heat. the price for a room was WAY too high for this level of quality!,pullout sofa in sitting room Doormen &amp; Hotel Manager were very nice

The Eliot Suite Hotel,Tina,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 14  2017,9.6,This is so small it's almost NOT worth mentioning....This is a historical hotel...so the bathroom. although luxurious. was a little small. like many city hotels. We did not mind it at all and found it be very charming...Preserving the integrity of the historical nature of the property. we found refreshing!,Staff was extremely friendly and professional. We arrived on an early flight and went to the hotel around 9:30am to ask if they could hold our luggage until check in. Not only did they check us in early. they upgraded us to a suite! What a pleasant surprise! So we were able to rest after an early flight before we hit the city for the day. The location was just perfect! Away from the noise. but walking distance from the beautiful city park and nestled between Newbury and Beacon Street the two most beautiful streets in the city!! GREAT location!! And a wonderful little bike rental shop on the corner across the street. We felt like we lived in the neighborhood because of the residential location amongst multi million dollar brownstone like properties and having the Harvard club next door. elite locals at that!!
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Dr,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,August 9  2017,7.1,Restaurant staff were awful - didn't have clue what was going on! Breakfast bar was never filled due to highly inefficient staff - when our final bill was produced. the restaurant had charged us for other people's food even though we'd signed for ours. What a shame the restaurant let the hotel down so very badly.,Good position for us as a family
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Lcn,Germany,1 review,August 8  2017,7.1,The airconditioning is a bit loud (quite annoying as it goes on/off). Aside from the Japanese Restaurant downstairs and Cof/Tea in our room pantry and a very tiny fridge with lots of mini bar bottles. there are no other facilities in the hotel. For Gym. the hotel provide a coupon for free access to the Gym across at Newbury Street.  We brought our swimming wear assuming that they have a pool in the hotel but no. no pool and definitely no lounge.,The bed is comfortable. Room is a good size and clean. Decent shower and amenities. All the staff we met were polite. friendly and helpful. Though it is a bit of a walk to downtown. in case you're feeling jetlag or too tired. the nearby Newbury Street have lots to offer in terms of dining and shopping.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Sherry,United States of America,7 Reviews,August 6  2017,8.8,We had terrible trouble getting a taxi and I come up every two weeks for cancer treatment!,I loved the staff and the room! I did not like the doorman that hailed us an uber that charged more than the taxi! When I mentioned this to him he got scared and wanted to pay us back! This was an obvious scam thing!  I also think that because it was the doorman that quoted us the price  for the uber and not the driver!
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Mary,United States of America,1 review,August 5  2017,10,I wish the gym was in the same building. However they do offer free passes to the BSC right around the corner.,This hotel has a ton of charm and character. As soon as you enter the lobby. you will notice how fancy and chic it is. The location of this hotel was awesome!  Close to the T. the shops at Newbury Street. and within walking distance to Fenway! I also liked how friendly the staff was. It's a fabulous hotel and I will stay here again!
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Jmag,Italy,14 Reviews,August 3  2017,9.2,Nothing. I believe this is the nicest place to stay in Boston and I used to live in Boston for many years.,The location. It doesn't get better than this. Staff pleasant and efficient and a gentleman named Joseph at the front desk gave some good recommendations. The restaurant is also nice.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Kimberly,United States of America,1 review,July 31  2017,7.5,The bathroom was TINY. We are slim and petite and we could barely fit in the bathroom. When you sit in the bathroom with the door closed you have a wall pertruding into your knees and the door is next to your elbow. We brought our teenage daughters and just shared the bathroom. There was no airflow into the bathroom so it was always fogged up and hard to see.,Location was nice and staff was very friendly. It is beautiful hotel. Close to Newbury Street and Fenway.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Mark,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 30  2017,10,Nothing.,Location was great.  We were 10 minutes from Fenway and close to shopping and restaurants.  Manny the doorman was great.  Gave us suggestions on where the locals eat.  The Poor House and The Corner Tavern.  Both had good food and atmosphere.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Jen,Canada,3 Reviews,July 17  2017,5.8,The room and the inside was very dated and tired looking wasn't really impressed with the comfort of the bed or the room it's self really needs an update,Location was decent and restaurant was excellent buy very pricey for the quantity
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Vishwavir,India,9 Reviews,July 14  2017,9.6,Relative to the size of the suites. the bathroom was a bit small.,Was with my daughter as we were in Boston checking out colleges. Rooms had two comfortable beds and another very nice sitting room - well laid out. Very courteous staff and good. prompt service. Room amenities were complete and sufficient in all respects.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Sd,Ireland,1 review,July 14  2017,7.5,Reception staff. strange fake Irish accent on one another extremely difficult to understand. No break down of costs or explanation when payment taken nor receipt at check out.,Got an upgrade. which was nice. Room well proportioned. nothing I didn't like about it. Bed comfortable.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Pamela,Spain,14 Reviews,July 13  2017,9.6,Nothing negative to say. The car was valet parked and we didn't need it during our stay. For someone who wants to use it often. it is 30 minute planning to get the car. Not an inconvenience for us but could be for others.,The hotel is beautiful. We were three people. so we had a room with two beds (rather than a suite). The room was big and well equipped. The staff was super friendly and helpful. I was greeted every morning with warm hellos and genuine questions. Our dog was welcomed and greeted as well. The reservation had an error but the hotel honored the original price and made the changes. The restaurant in the hotel serves lovely Japanese food. Location is great in the Back Bay.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Megan,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,July 12  2017,9.2,They were having renovation works in the restaurant down stairs. When we checked in. they mentioned we had been upgraded....to the room directly above the works. It started at around 8am and was loud drilling right beneath the wall near our bed. Mentioned it to the receptionist who made me aware that they wouldn't be working on the Saturday and were finishing shortly. Offered to move us and have no complaints about the way the situation was handled. These things happen!,The staff where extremely friendly and made our stay very pleasant.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Jennifer,Canada,1 review,July 10  2017,7.1,I had an unfortunate incident with a robe that appeared to be moldy. Given breakfast vouchers and I was not served until after my companions had finished! Also. no one told us that we would have to wait until 7am to have access to our car (early morning trip) as none of the front desk staff could  drive.  Walked and picked up the vehicle myself.,We love the location and boutique style of this hotel.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Renee,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 10  2017,8.3,The first room had an odd bathroom with the toilet right next to the door. so we switched rooms.The sofa bed was very uncomfortable so we put the mattress on the floor for my son. and housekeeping did not make it up. even after multiple requests. I gave that feedback to the manager and think they have likely corrected the problem.Also the gym is not onsite. though you can use a gym 3 minutes away. However that gym closes early on Sunday. so I was not able to workout after our arrival Sunday.,We loved the sitting area in the suite. the rooms are tastefully decorated. and the staff was wonderfull.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Maria,Cyprus,11 Reviews,July 10  2017,8.3,Our room was semi basement with windows overlooking huge. rusty. mechanical equipment in a back alley. Not a huge problem as we had a late arrival and only stayed one night. No noise has to be said. Although rooms and linen were clean. a dead cockroach outside our door was a bit off putting.,Great location in quiet neighbourhood very near busy Newbury Street. Beds very comfortable. room amenities very practical-slippers and shower caps would have been appreciated though.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Caroline,United States of America,1 review,July 6  2017,7.1,size of the bathroom ridiculous for a suite. Also shower curtain smelled terrible (mildew). Air conditioner loud and inefficient.  Food in restaurant average at best and very expensive.  Coffee AWFUL.,location a bonus. Size of the room good. Room service and other services excellent.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Miriam,Austria,19 Reviews,July 3  2017,5.0,Super small bathroom - there wasn't even space for the towels. they were stored next to the bed. Also very expensive overnight parking! The staff did not inform me about fitness opportunities. The hotel is old and run-down - not as it looks in the pictures. Not recommendable!,N/A
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Susan,United States of America,9 Reviews,July 1  2017,10,The windows were very difficult to open. The extra pillows in the closet are far nicer than the overstuffed pillows on the bed.,The staff was exceptional and truly made you feel like a welcomed guest. The room was beautiful. with a great bath and shower. comfortable bed. nice coffee maker. wet bar. and couches. I'll never stay anywhere else in Boston. This place is perfect.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Dr,Canada,1 review,June 30  2017,8.3,some of the decor has  a timeworn look but this contributes to the comfortable look.perfect choice,the privacy afforded by a suite when family likes to visit back and forth was a much appreciated feature for our group of 8. also the suites just felt homey and comfortable and relaxing.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Kim,Canada,3 Reviews,June 26  2017,6.3,I had booked two upgraded suites about 8 months before we left as we were celebrating my husband's birthday. I also indicated this in our reservation.  While my parents received a beautiful. large room overlooking the city. for the same money my husband and I were placed in a much smaller room overlooking an alley that was full of garbage bins. It was terrible. I did request to move and was accommodated the following day - for a property of his calibre I would not expect this to happen. It was very embarrassing after having convinced everyone to stay here instead of the Fairmont or Loews.,The staff were extremely professional and helpful!  It was easy to walk through Back Bay and even downtown. Lots to see and do in the area.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,David,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,June 25  2017,9.2,Small but stylish bathroom. More overhead lighting.,Very comfortable bed.charming helpful staff.great location spacious suite.Very quiet.Decent breakfast. Old school Boston style and personal service.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Helen,Singapore,7 Reviews,June 24  2017,5.4,Showering room is very small. Housekeeping is so bad. I stay four night in this hotel. I saw there is some unidentified hair in showering room at the first night. Nobody clean it during my staying. One word:- dirty.,The location is very near newbury street. Good! The staff at reception us so nice.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Anonymous,New Zealand,2 Reviews,June 22  2017,8.8,The loud air conditioning system.,The character building which makes the hotel.The location and close proximity to the great features Boston has on offer.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Moya,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,June 22  2017,10,Nothing everything perfect,Staff superbly trained. elegance from the moment we entered the lobby until the moment we left excellent Japanese restaurant fab location
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Traveller,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,June 19  2017,7.9,Bathrooms a little small. stayed at nicer for similar money in Boston. Rooms a little old fashioned for my tastes. Although in Back Bay felt there are nicer hotel locations in Back Bay as was right next to some major busy roads.,Was only a 30 min walk to Boston Common. 15 min walk to Prudential Building (shopping). Starbucks 5 mins walk.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Jeffrey,United States of America,5 Reviews,June 12  2017,10,N/A,Love the charm that this hotel has! Beautiful rooms with so much character. Staff is excellent and always remember us by name! Short walk to Fenway Park. Love Kevin. Faeq &amp; Sebastien!!! They make our stay extra special each &amp; every time!!!!
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Larry,United States of America,1 review,June 9  2017,7.9,To know what street as you are on a corner you would have preferred us to park while waiting for valet services as it was very busy on Commonwealth ave.,The living space separate from the bed room was helpful for friends we were down in that area to meet.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Chiara,Thailand,40 Reviews,June 3  2017,9.2,Reception area is small. can be very busy at certain times of day. The bathrooms are also small comparing to the total room size and the closets (though clean and efficient.) They do have a small kitchenette area with a sink and drink bar. I feel the standard small hotel fridge is rather limited. no freezer compartment.,We've come back here every time we were in Boston though we've tried quite a few 4-5 star hotels throughout the many trips. The services have been unbeatable. from Reception. Bell service. Valet  and Housekeeping. We felt like home. The suites are tastefully decorated like what we see in the photos. the living room very comfortable with a large sofa bed. the small kitchenette area adds to the comfort of home though no microwave. just a drink bar with coffeemaker and a sink. I especially like the flexibility of a one or two bedroom suite for families of 3 or 4 people.Wifi works very well. no need to re-enter password which makes life so easy. We find breakfast expensive but with the location just off Newbury. it is easy to get breakfast nearby. We like that there is a good Modern Japanese restaurant at the hotel.I'd like to specially thank Mr. Dhadve. the Manager at the Front desk who had efficiently helped to accommodate our requests here and there due to the changes of plan. He positively answers all our questions. even helped with the luggages as we had so many among our group of 6. Your Thai staff. Mae. gave us traditional Thai greetings every time we came in. love that nice little touch. Also big thanks to the Bell team when we checked out with lots of heavy luggages the night of 29 May. both were most friendly and efficient.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Cheri,United States of America,4 Reviews,May 30  2017,10,N/A,Convenient to Fenway Park as well as shopping on Newbury Street.  All the staff who greeted us were so pleasant!  Our only disappointment is we were too busy to try the Ramen Restaurant at the hotel.  We will definitely stay at the Eliot again!
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Fletcher,United States of America,1 review,May 29  2017,9.6,It's a little out of the way. We had a car. but you would need taxis to get to most things.,I booked this stay for my partner's birthday. It was a perfect choice. Room was very comfortable and the staff could not have been nicer.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,David,United States of America,37 Reviews,May 16  2017,10,Boston is an expensive city.,Boston is an expensive city. but the value of the Eliot is in its location. its comfort. its great staff. and the generous size of the rooms. Our king suite cost about as much as a king room in nearby hotels. and gave an extra level of luxury.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Constantine,Greece,14 Reviews,May 11  2017,4.2,The hotel - it felt old and tired as if it needed refurbishing or modernizing. The furniture felt like it needed a good cleaning - the room was dark and dreary - the lighting was bad - everything about this hotel was bad except for the staff.  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone -  The hotel is way over priced for what they offer.,The staff was very friendly and helpful...
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Carmen,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 7  2017,10,The restaurant. staff or the breakfast offering wasn't that great. But not a problem since surrounding restaurants were quite good and reasonably priced.,The bed was the most comfortable I've experienced away from home in a LONG time. I really enjoyed having a separate living area.  Hotel was immaculate!
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Anonymous,Switzerland,23 Reviews,May 7  2017,9.2,In our room. (305) the toilet is set very close to the wall so although this wasn't a big deal. it would be difficult/awkward for a large shouldered person. I felt that this was a design error.  Also my husband commented that the bathroom shelves were small and narrow making it difficult to put even a few necessary items near the sink.  Again. not a deal breaker but something to think about if this type of thing bothers you.  The internet was good. not super. but manageable.,The staff was very friendly especially the doormen. and especially Kevin.  The bed was very very comfortable and the water pressure in the shower was excellent and the shower curtain (in addition to the glass wall) kept the water in the correct place (and off the marble floor outside the shower which is often a problem in some hotels).  The location is really excellent to Newbury Street. Hynes Convention center. mailboxes. restaurants etc.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Nicole,Australia,4 Reviews,May 4  2017,10,Breakfast (standard) is very average so you need to go al la carte but cafes are also around the corner.,Loveliest hotel I've stayed in. I actually did not want to leave my room to see Boston. I was upgraded to a suite and enjoyed in room service That was exceptional. Bar downstairs was incredible.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Laurinda,United States of America,3 Reviews,May 3  2017,10,I was there for a shopping trip and there was nothing I did not like.,Dinner at Uni was fabulous and very unique.  Breakfast room service was also excellent!  Arrived hot and fresh. Delicious coffee.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Sirissa,United States of America,1 review,May 1  2017,5.4,The building outside is beautiful. The rooms are VERY small and dated. We had a problem with ALL the electrical outlets. None of them worked properly. they were very loose. We thought we were charging our cell phones and lap tops. and woke up to all dead phones. We did have children @ home trying to get in touch with us. and were unable to. do to dead phones. So. they were very worried and nervous. and also our alarms did not go off because of that issue as well. We did let the front desk know. and they brought up a power strip. which was worthless. because we would have had to leave the light switch on in order to use that. Who wants to sleep with the lights on?,N/A
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Florence,Switzerland,2 Reviews,May 1  2017,7.1,Room next to (or behinde) elevator. Was quite noisy through that. Wrong side. no view,In general very nice. good room service. had everything we needed. Good location
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Chitra,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 1  2017,8.8,Whenever a/c kicked on it woke me up. And I was wearing earplugs.  Cost was more than it needed to be (out king size bed suite was more expensive than the Taj Hotel).,Staff was super friendly and super nice. Two thumbs up to them.  Lobby is small but beautiful. Room was huge (a suite) and clean. Very comfy. Great water pressure in shower. Awesome towels. Great location
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Guðrún,Iceland,2 Reviews,April 26  2017,9.6,N/A,The friendly staff made this hotel stay extra special. everyone went out of their way to assist us. sometimes even without us asking. Would highly recommend this hotel.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Eun,South Korea,15 Reviews,April 25  2017,9.2,no slippers. no water( I think they forgot). no tissue in dinning room,very large. comfortable bedroom. kind staff.  welcoming chocolate. good experinece
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Susan,United States of America,1 review,April 24  2017,10,Our view.  It was a brick wall and alley with little outside light.  It's located in a pretty area so I would definitely ask for a street view.,The bed and linens were perfect.  The living room area was nicely furnished and large enough to seat 4 comfortably.The staff was attentive.The hotel is quiet and feels homey.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Melanie,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,April 20  2017,9.6,N/A,Decor was classic but understated with romantic undertones. Bed and pillows comfy. Generous sized suite. Boutique style hotel - small but special!Staff extremely helpful.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Elizabeth,United States of America,7 Reviews,April 19  2017,10,With being on the first floor. there was some building and truck noise early one morning.,Love this hotel and have stayed now 3 times for the Boston Marathon. It's my go-to spot.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Richard,United States of America,1 review,April 18  2017,10,The bed mattress with a bit too soft.,Excellent boutique hotel. The staff was courteous and very helpful. Wonderful. central location. We will definitely stay there again on future visits to Boston.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Eileen,United States of America,1 review,April 18  2017,9.2,Wall of bed was against elevator mechanics. so those noises where sometimes a problem. Earplugs look care if it.,In the elevator. I asked Rosemarie about public transport to the airport. She spent a lot of time with me to explain the route thoroughly. stepping off the elevator at my stop to make sure I had all the information. The staff in general was extremely helpful and friendly without being in our business too much. Location was on the Boston marathon route but  at an intersection that made it very easy to get a taxi to the airport even with all the roadblocks.
The Eliot Suite Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,April 18  2017,8.8,N/A,Great hotel for the Boston Marathon! Within walking distance to the Expo. Finish line. and busses to the start (all within 1 mile). Close to restaurants. bars....Valet parking. Staff was very helpful and always friendly!!
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Carolyn,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 31  2017,9.6,View of HVAC system and back of house- “view” horrible but location of hotel itself wonderful.,Loved the canine ambassador. Carly. who greets new guests. Staff very friendly and professional.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Fahad,Saudi Arabia,16 Reviews,October 27  2017,5.8,I am very disappointed with this hotel:workers look at you carry your heavy luggage without helping or offering to help. wifi keeps disconnecting. some charger outlets in room not working. some lamps not working. they did not provide shampoo and conditioner .. etc..,However. one lady at reception helped me with train booking
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Dorothy,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 23  2017,9.6,I would have liked free transportation to and from the airport. Some hotels do have that service.,Staying in the Fairmont Gold rooms entitled us to hors d'oeuvres in the evening and buffet breakfast in the morning. There is also an honor bar in the Gold Lounge.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Susan,United Kingdom,1 review,October 13  2017,10,I did not like the hotel letting a couple share their room with a small pig  the couple said the pig slept on the bed with them.They were walking the pig on a lead.around the hotel. I was not amused.I expected more from a 5 star hotel.,The staff were wonderful nothing was a problem for them.The room was spacious. and also the bathroom.which had plenty of towels.  The beds were very comfortable. the air con was easy to use.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Rogeradallas,United States of America,9 Reviews,October 11  2017,8.8,Public areas are still very dark and old fashioned. but thats in keeping with the 'style' of an older hotel,Rooms have been updated and are very comfortable
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Andrew,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,October 11  2017,9.2,Disappointed that our room overlooked the internal side of the hotel seeing as how we had booked a deluxe king room.We arrived back from our day out at 4pm to find that our room had not been serviced. which was rather disappointing considering that the domestic staff were outside our room when we left at 8:30am.The decoration of the corridors look dark and tired and in need of refreshing to be brighter.,The room facilities were exactly as we would expect from a Fairmont having previously stayed in the Fairmont in San Francisco.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 9  2017,9.6,Valet was poor someone took a envelope with $10. Or more in change for my truck very very disappointed with that.,Staff was very good clean and classy room
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Marie,United States of America,1 review,October 9  2017,10,N/A,I'm not sure if there was just one thing that I liked about the hotel.  It was clean. the staff were friendly. We got into the restaurant even though they were all booked.  My daughter forgot her tooth brush and they gave her one.  It was in all a great weekend at the Fairmont!
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 3  2017,6.7,To say the bathroom was horrible would be a compliment. The toilet was literally tucked UNDER the basin of the pedestal sink.  There was no storage. The towels hung in the shower and had to be removed to stay dry but there was no where to hang them. Not a single hook in the bathroom.  It was a 5'x6' box.  I've had better bathrooms at a Comfort Inn.,The room was nice.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 27  2017,5.4,Two of the three rooms were below acceptable. One room - the bathroom - you could not sit on the toilet without having to shift sideways to not bump up against the heater! We waited 50 minutes for our bags to be delivered. Had to call and go down to find the Bellman. We waited 45 minutes for car to be brought up then asked why it was taking so long and no one had gone to get it! We stood waiting and not one person thought to ask - "Are you bring helped?",The staff in the restaurant were great
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Paula,Canada,2 Reviews,September 26  2017,9.6,N/A,great hotel and staff is helpful and friendly. Clean hotel and room. Good breakfast at the hotel restaurant and good location. Would stay there again.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Marcos,Brazil,13 Reviews,September 20  2017,6.0,For a hotel asking more than US$500.00 a day. is absurd to pay for internet. Room was big but poorly planned. TV was six meters away the bed. No view from the two windows. The staff doesn't know how to pamper guests that are paying full rate at a luxury hotel. They think  everybody are guests participating in a convention with low expectations and the company paying half price rates. Parts of the room not well finished,Location is the best in town.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Diane,United States of America,4 Reviews,September 12  2017,9.2,Shower and shower walls were not very clean. towels thread bare for a 5 star hotel. Overall loved it.,The bed was very comfortable. The room was extremely comfortable as a whole.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Desiree,United States of America,1 review,September 11  2017,7.5,My view obstructed by a/c duct and they charged my card in advance for the entire stay after my first night! Room 154 had the crappy view!,Room and bathroom were beautiful. Good mini bar. Complimentary bath/shower products smelled amazing.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Karen,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,September 7  2017,9.2,As our room faced an internal area it was noisy with lots of fans and air con noise. We moved once but was still an issue. even in an exec room.,Beautiful building and helpful staff.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Traveller63,Greece,69 Reviews,September 5  2017,6.3,Incredibly overpriced hotel . We paid 1000 $ for a 2 night stay without breakfast getting a room  facing a wallThe hotel is old and looks very tired.Decades must have passed  from the last renovation.No sleepers in the room (possibly the only 5* hotel in the world)  . no complimentary still water. You have to ask to get  and it could take an hour to deliverNo breakfast buffet but only a la cart so consider 80 dollars for 2 person,The only reason to pick this hotel is because it is located in Copley Plaza
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Igors,Latvia,1 review,August 28  2017,5.0,I was upgraded to a superior room from standard but it was on the lowest floor. which is like a basement and from the window you can't even see the street. which was unpleasant. It was late at night. I was so tired and didn't want to start an argument about that and they have said that the hotel is fully booked for the night. At 8 in the morning. construction started right under my window even though at the reception they have said that it is the quietest room that they have and didn't even warn me about the possible construction. Very disappointed with disinformation for such money everything should be perfect.,N/A
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Lp,United States of America,1 review,August 25  2017,10,N/A,Great farmers market in front of the hotel. They also have a hotel dog for guests who miss their own pet. You can even take the dog for a walk. Fun for kids.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Nico,Belgium,20 Reviews,August 20  2017,7.5,Carpet flooring in hallways smelled strange. no breakfast included,For the price we paid. we got excellent service. a hotel located very close to nice part of Boston (shops. park. water). subway at few steps and a well equiped gym. The hotel is somewhat outdated which one could consider part of the 'grandeur'. Breakfast was not included in the price (known at time of booking) but for the price paid. I believe a breakfast should be in. We however got free wifi (which was announced at $10/day on booking.com)
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Doctor,United Kingdom,10 Reviews,August 17  2017,10,Nothing!!!!,Excellent location. all staff were very friendly and very helpful. We travel to the US on a regular basis and will be back. Great Hotel. Great Location. Great Staff!!!
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Terry,United States of America,1 review,July 31  2017,6.7,Concierge. Zach. less than helpful. Asked directions to a restaurant.  He told us it was just across the street.  Turns out that it was two blocks away. inside of a shopping mall and on the third floor.  Took us 30 minutes to walk there for being "right across the street."  Oh. and did I mention it was raining!,N/A
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Margaret,Australia,1 review,July 30  2017,6.7,Air con and plumbing was very noisy.  Could open small window in bathroom but noise from airwell was unbearable at night.  Breakfast scrambled eggs were terrible.,N/A
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Joanne,United States of America,1 review,July 29  2017,8.8,The room was beautiful but very small.  There were no dressers.,The location was perfect.  Friendliness of staff.  Gold club floor.....just ideal.  Knowledgeable staff.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Sharon,United States of America,7 Reviews,July 27  2017,10,The only suggestion I could give is to have something on the wall by the bathtub to help you get out.,I LOVED THE ANTIQUE DECOR AND HOW WONDERFUL THE MANAGER WAS IN THE RESTAURANT!  I ASKED IF I COULD ORDER FRUIT TO TAKE OUT FOR MY RIDE HOME ON THE TRAIN AND WHEN I WENT TO PAY. HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT THE MONEY.  WE HAD EATEN THERE TWICE BEFORE AND IT WAS  LOVELY!
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Danielle,United States of America,1 review,July 26  2017,3.8,The room we stayed in. room 212. is right next to the elevator and open staircase. It was incredibly loud the entire time. It was hard to fall asleep and stay asleep. We heard doors slamming. people running up and down the stairs and the elevators sounds. When we asked the front desk our options. we were told we could move down one level and it would be a bit more "quieter". I wasn't sure what that meant - for the amount of money we were spending at the Fairmont you shouldn't have to settle for "a bit more quieter". Also during our stay there was construction going on. on the roof - right next to our room. When we opened our curtains there were men walking around the roof. Again. for the amount we spent for only 2 nights - this is ridiculous. If you know there will be construction going on. therefore loud noises. in certain rooms you might want to consider closing a few rooms until the construction is over. I have stayed at the Fairmont Copley numerous times before. and all were fabulous. I am so sad that this was my last experience - it is going to be make it extremely hard to ever want to stay there again.,N/A
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Cathy,Canada,1 review,July 24  2017,8.8,We felt the prices for room service were outrageous and a drink in the restaurant was 14.95 US which was ridiculous. We were not super happy that our room had no view and the workers working on the building were very noisy,We loved the location. The room was very nice and bed comfy.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Mary,United States of America,1 review,July 17  2017,9.2,I didn't like that Wi-Fi was not included since the Price of the hotel is on the high end.,Arthur the bell hop was awesome. He took the time to go over the hotel amenities and all that there was to see in Boston.  since this was our first visit to Boston.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Wenjun,Australia,1 review,July 14  2017,9.2,The only thing that was a bit unsatisfactory was the bathroom being too small. there was very little bench space to put personal belongings so we had to put them all on the desk.,Superb location. beautiful hotel. excellent and polite service.  Pet friendly and my daughter even had the chance to walk the hotel ambassador dog which was a thrilling experience.  The only thing that was a bit unsatisfactory was the bathroom being too small. there was very little bench space to put personal belongings so we had to put them all on the desk.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Anonymous,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,July 12  2017,7.9,The first Signiture Room was musty and damp. Moved rooms to a Fairmont Gold with smaller beds and without a view but better room overall.,Location and history of the building. The Oak Bar is a great restaurant.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Cynthia,United States of America,1 review,July 10  2017,9.2,The bathroom lighting seems very harsh.  There is no good place for a lady to prep.  Larger vanity space and softer lighting would be just the ticket!   Also when we checked in. our room was ready early. which was nice. but she said we could have a room with a view. and our 2 views were both solid walls.,Loved the exquisite lobby and other 1st floor rooms.  Location was perfect.  Cleanliness top notch.  It was an elegant experience staying here while we attended a wedding at the Boston Public Library.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,James,United States of America,7 Reviews,July 4  2017,4.6,This is a stunningly overpriced dump. The endless dark. foreboding hallways often lead you nowhere (think Jack Nicholson's hotel in The Shining).  For $336 a night. I got stuck way down one of these morose hallways next to construction equipment piled outside my window.  There was no refrigerator or ice bucket in the room.  It took them almost 3 hours and several calls for them to bring me an ice bucket.  Within minutes of checking in. I noticed a serious building code violation.  It was a door on the second floor prominently marked with a red EXIT sign -  which was locked.  I went down and mentioned this to a gaggle of dazed milling and chatting millennial staff in the lobby. and and they were clearly annoyed with my pointing this out.  But miraculously the door was unlocked by the following morning.  For $336 per night. the Fairmont required me to pay extra for WiFi.  No. not Premium Wifi - ANY WiFi.  Even Motel 6 has a fridge and an ice bucket in all the rooms. and FREE WiFi!  I know the Copley Fairmont is a "landmark." but it's time to knock it down. fire all the greedy and useless incompetent staff. and build something that is even remotely worth the money in that location.  But for now - stay away!,Great location
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Barry,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,July 2  2017,8.8,We stayed at the Loews Hotel a few days before and the cost per room per night was significantly cheaper. the extra cost at the Fairmont didn't really equate to an overal better experience. nonetheless it was lovely to stay at this traditional Boston Hotel.,Nice size bed and room was very comfortable.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Ruksana,Italy,1 review,July 2  2017,9.2,The free internet connection was quite poor.,The bed was very comfortable. we loved the room style and furniture. The bathroom was very clean and spacious. The location is simply great!
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Carmen,Belgium,1 review,June 27  2017,7.5,I would propose these improvements:A cosier reception area in the middle with sofas and coffee tablesA swimming pooolA complimentary tea or coffee for early birds like me at the reception areaSome apples in the fitness area,The restaurant was very beautiful and cosy.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Anonymous,Ireland,10 Reviews,June 22  2017,7.5,We paid a total of 900 dollars for two nights stay with no breakfast. That speaks for itself. To add to this we had to pay total of 9 dollars for bottle of water in the room that should be supplied at these prices. I was appalled to find they were asking for 10 dollars per day for internet. How ridiculous is that. It is a fabulous old world hotel with lovely front of house ambience and old world embellishments. But it seems they are using this to add anything they can to the bill.,Very comfortable mattress. poor view looking out on unfinished building works.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Kevin,Switzerland,1 review,June 13  2017,5.4,The first room they tried to give us was horrible. Small as a shoe box. Looked like a single room. After complaining 3 times and an hour and half of waiting a decent room on a non lounge floor was found.  only problem was the bathroom was a postage stamp. Very disappointing rooms for a 5 Star Deluxe Hotel with 5 star prices.,Location - Restaurant - Club Lounge
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Anna,Greece,11 Reviews,June 7  2017,9.2,I asked to check out just an hour later and the receptionist did not allow me to since she "was not sure" when the room would be occupied by the new guests,Excellent location. professional staff. great facilities. extra clean and comfortable rooms.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Lou,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,June 6  2017,9.6,They could do with getting a pool /spa facilities,Room spotlessly clean. Concierge room worth the extra cost. Fantastic stay. Friendly. helpful staff.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,User1,United States of America,1 review,May 31  2017,3.3,writing a hotel review for the first time and want to say that the property is very outdated and by saying very outdated I mean really old. I booked the Fairmont King Room because of the photos provided by the hotel but most importantly because it was stated that the room was recently renovated. when i arrived the staff at the reception informed me that the room was in fact renovated. but not recently. The room was tiny. the furniture old and scratched. The closet smelled like dust so i kept my things in the suitcase for the whole trip. the safe box did not work properly. every morning i double checked that it is locked. yet every night i came to discover an open safe. ZERO sound isolation- every morning I woke up to the sound of someone talking in the room next door or the phone ringing in the other room. the bathroom is tiny. no place to put a cosmetics bag or anything. i was looking for a socket to plug my charger in and reached under the bed with a flashlight just to discover a layer of dust everywhere underneath.,ONLY the location of the hotel
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Emily,United States of America,1 review,May 26  2017,8.8,The room while well furnished was small. The lobby was always packed with people going in and out of meetings,The location was  great. the staff very helpful. the hotel old and beautiful. The room while small was totally adequate. I also liked the many notifications and reservation reminders I received ahead of time. When I arrived check-in was easy as was check out.

Fairmont Copley Plaza,Allison,United States of America,1 review,May 7  2017,10,N/A,Fairmont Copley Plaza is a real gem of a hotel.  While it is full of classic detail. it has all the energy of a more modern property.  The staff is very warm and efficient.  The rooms are large and well appointed with clean lines but the space you can't find in modern hotels that tend to mask their small space with "mod design" details.  The Fairmont gym is also a standout - on the small side but so efficiently laid out that it works well for many users -- and has beautiful  skyline views.  Will return!
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Hadeel,Saudi Arabia,1 review,May 6  2017,8.8,I did ask to extend my stay for 6 hours and Payed 50% of the highest room rate.,T his is a third time to stay in fairmont  copley plaza to attend a course conducted in the same hotel. I got the signature room.spacious with nice view. The staff are friendly.  Breakfast in the restaurant is so good.Location is just perfect. I did not use a cap during my stay except for coming and going back to the airport. Shopping mall and restaurants are all walking distanceThe only thing that upset me that I did ask to extend my stay for 6 hours and Payed 50% of the highest room rate.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,May 6  2017,9.2,For the price. the WiFi should have been free. You should also be able to park your car there for free.,Beautiful hotel. Centrally located in Boston making it easy to walk the city.

Fairmont Copley Plaza,Laurence86,United Kingdom,46 Reviews,April 16  2017,9.6,N/A,Great historic hotel in the best location in Back Bay.

A very pleasant stay
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Charles,United States of America,1 review,April 13  2017,9.2,$51 per day for valet. I think they can do better for multi day stays.

Gym is new and fairly large.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Christopher,United States of America,1 review,April 11  2017,8.8,N/A,The staff could not have been friendlier and were beyond warm and welcoming. The room itself(king deluxe) was immaculate and one of the comfiest beds I have slept on.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Joy,Philippines,3 Reviews,March 27  2017,9.6,A bit expensive,Fairmont Copley Plaza main entrance is lavished with grand victorian design which will truly catch your eyes.

Truly highly recommendable hotel with exuding elegance and style...
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,March 20  2017,7.9,The rooms did not match the splendor of the lobby and restaurant. Very basic no frills rooms that were not worth the rate at all.,The lobby and restaurant were a highlight of Boston.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Dmitry,Japan,20 Reviews,March 18  2017,10,Would really like the breakfast to be buffet style. Not by order.,The location is premiere.

Fairmont Copley Plaza,Sfcsolar,United States of America,15 Reviews,February 13  2017,10,I had a hard time getting the temperature in the room the way I wanted it. I usually sleep with a fan on me even in February so it's more me than the room.,I highly recommend the 4th floor that allows access to the gold concierge lounge. This lounge is fantastic and is always stocked with goodies.

The location is superb. I will be back for sure.
Fairmont Copley Plaza,Anonymous,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,January 8  2017,7.1,The room and some communal parts such as corridors were clearly a bit tired.

Fairmont Copley Plaza,Donald,United States of America,1 review,January 2  2017,10,N/A,The front desk staff was extremely helpful during our stay.

Fairmont Copley Plaza,Ambrose,Qatar,43 Reviews,December 31  2016,7.5,Room was uncomfortable no where to sit and the Lounge although homely provided a poor breakfast and daytime selection. better to go for a JW Marrriott.

Fairmont Copley Plaza,Noreen,Ireland,5 Reviews,December 8  2016,6.3,Room was disappointing for the price. Shabby and outdated with none of the extra features expected from upscale hotel.My advice is if you are average income person stay in mid range hotel and try to get the best room. The delux room in this hotel was not delux. The whole experience was disappointing .,Good location

Global Luxury Suites at Kenmore Square,Berman,United States of America,1 review,July 31  2017,7.1,Location booked in May was changed and I was told when I called about something different 2 months later. Would've been nice to have been notified earlier. Also. wasn't told I had to pay for parking until the night before we left. Parking is awful. 6 spots only. very. very tight. Barely could squeeze in a Honda. Came back to the room in the evening to find the AC wasn't working. Had to call NJ for issues in Boston. Very disorganized. Might be better when they get their act together. Ken Nord. one of the customer service people onsite was great.,Clean

Global Luxury Suites at Kenmore Square,Barbara,United States of America,1 review,March 15  2016,6.3,the bed was very uncomfortable- they only gave us one key which was very difficult with 3 people- you cannot use the concierge downstairs you have to call the management company for everything - it took over 24 hours to get a second key and then it didn't have the FOB on it so it was of no use at night as you need the FOB to get in the building at night. - nice apt but its not worth the hassle- will stay in a hotel for now on.,the location was good- and the square footage was nice

Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,David,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 18  2017,7.5,N/A,Unlike other airport hotels. this one is an easy walk to the Boston Airport T station. so it's an quick trip pretty much to everything (the aquarium is 10 minutes. Fanueil Hall market is 13 minutes.)  The facilities are exactly what Embassy Suites is famous for and when it's time to go. you are a short shuttle away from your terminal at the airport.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Armando,Bermuda,6 Reviews,October 16  2017,8.3,Everything was great less the cleanliness of the common areas.

Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Kg,United States of America,1 review,August 21  2017,5.4,The staff was rude especially the manager Calvin Berry.

It was nice that there was also a hot shower and towels at the pool.  The 24 hour shuttle was efficient and service was excellent.

Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Jen,United States of America,7 Reviews,July 25  2017,9.2,Parking costs were quite high.

Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Jean,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,July 25  2017,8.8,The room temperature was too cool when we arrived. This was soon rectified by changing the air conditioning thermostat. It seemed such a waste of resources and energy to cool it so much.The shock when. at first. I was told to pay the bill for a second time having already paid when I booked more than a month earlier. This was later cleared up when the deduction came off the bill at the next stage but for a few minutes I tried to explain that I had already paid. The staff were very apologetic but it was a nasty surprise.,Closeness to T and car rental- both walking distance which meant we could return car a day earlier than thought we might have to.The staff at the door were very helpful when we needed to empty our rental car at the hotel before returning the car. The staff at restaurant were very good at finding out exactly what I could and could not eat as I have a severe dairy intolerance.The evening nibbles were wonderful after a long drive with little lunch.It was lovely to have such a comfortable. spacious room for the last night of our stay in US.Our flight out didn't leave until 10.30 pm and the hotel looked after our luggage so we could go out and enjoy Boston. then return. change and repack our bags before we went to the airport.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Michael,United States of America,1 review,July 20  2017,9.2,They didn't have a record of my reservation that I made weeks earlier on booking.com.

Got to the back of the hotel. but had to get back on the highway to come around front.,Great breakfast included - made-to-order omelets. great selection
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Richard,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 16  2017,8.8,Location. you have to ride the train to downtown and there didn't seem to be anything near the hotel that you could walk to.,The price was better than the hotels right downtown.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Candia,U.S. Virgin Islands,2 Reviews,July 16  2017,6.7,That the hotel had a room ready.,I had changed my reservation through bookings.com. but when i arrived at the hotel - at midnight. there was no record of the change. and i was told the hotel was booked; i waited 30 min. showed my confirmation of the change from bookings.com. and finally was given a room.  Was very surprised. but it turned out ok.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Barry,United Kingdom,1 review,July 14  2017,8.3,Airport shuttle wasn't very frequent on our stay. Had to wait 30 mins at airport. This service was not advertised.,Comfy bed. Quiet location. Very comprehensive breakfast options.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Adrienne,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 12  2017,10,I didn't like the breakfast buffet. Some of the items were cold. We did arrive 30 minutes before it ended. but still. hot waffles and eggs would have been nice. The omelet station was definitely much better.,The omelet station was amazing. The breakfast was served at a decent hour. and they had a free snack served around 4pm. that was also enjoyable. The business center was phenomenal. I forgot to print some travel documents. and was able to print them and have copies made. It was easy to get to the train from the hotel. which made traveling to and from downtown Boston a breeze. and affordable.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Susan,United States of America,1 review,July 6  2017,10,Hamburgers were over $15....thought that was too much but was delicious.Shuttle driver on Wed 5am didn't help any of us with our luggage. ..fairly full shuttle for early flights. He was in hotel. Guest helped us all.,Wonderful bed..I couldn't have made it 5 days w/o a good bed.Loved the diverse and delicious breakfast. ..so much to choose from.Good help from the desk on city map.Friendly employees. Didn't find anything about the hotel we didn't like. Airport Shuttles were great.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Suzanne,United States of America,1 review,July 4  2017,9.6,Front desk staff were a little condescending.rushed. and dismissive despite the fact that there were not many people checking in when I did.,Very comfortable suite - it was our anniversary and I was flying out alone the following AM. so it was both convenient and comfortable to meet there the night before my flight.Shuttle service to Logan is fantastic.Friendly staff for the most part. especially in the dining/bar area.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Denise,United States of America,1 review,July 3  2017,6.7,I was given a handicap accessible room. There was no self parking available. Finding the hotel was difficult and pulling up to valet was almost impossible. Valet parking was $44/night and with no other parking option seemed crazy. Check in staff was rude when I asked about the airport shuttle.,Proximity to rental car return. Free airport shuttle. Room was spacious. The doormen/valets were helpful.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Anonymous,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,June 29  2017,9.2,I was incorrectly charged a higher room rate by the reception desk. When I pointed this out they failed to apologise for their error regarding it as an inconvenience and reluctantly refunded the difference between the correct rate and their inflated rate. However. they failed to understand that in refunding the difference between the two room rates I was still paying taxes on the higher rate so that my overall charge would have been higher than it should have been. I gave up trying to explain this to the receptionist and accepted the bill with the refund included.,N/A
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Irene,United States of America,1 review,June 27  2017,7.5,The fitness room had only one bike.  No small (#2) dumbbells. no leg press or chest press.  I haven't trained on a universal gym yet and didn't feel safe trying to figure out the pulleys or haul weights. The pool is tiny. but I was glad to do some aqua exercise in it. You're not thinking of the many older clients who need to keep up daily light exercise. In the room.  I could not manipulate the rods to open and close drapes.  The desk and chair were in the way.,The hotel is practically inside the airport.  I caught my flight with no stress. I enjoyed the spa. though the pool was too small for swimming.  Ok for cooling off.  The bed was very comfortable.  I appreciated the yoga mat.  The restaurant on site was convenient. and the breakfast was plentiful.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Brandon,United States of America,1 review,June 26  2017,4.6,The bathroom was old and run down,the shower was broken.  the hotel sent someone up to fix it but by the time the person arrived. it was too late for our travel plans

Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,David,United States of America,1 review,June 19  2017,6.3,After staying at another Hilton property in Chelsea on the way to Cape Cod the Embassy Suites facilities need some "sprucing up." especially in the dining area.,Proximity to MBTA Airport station.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Agnes,Ireland,20 Reviews,June 11  2017,7.9,The person who checked us in was bit rude we all felt. This is the only negative about our stay.,The rooms were very comfortable.  The free breakfast was amazing. Most of the staff were very friendly. The location so close to the airport was brilliant.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Traveller,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,June 11  2017,6.3,Breakfast was terrible: hot food was luke warm or even cold; no fresh bread; no proper coffee. The hotel has no nice inside/outside area's that invite you to sit down or spent some time; there is no place (nearby) to get a coffee.,Spacious suite; firm and good bed; good sound insulation from the airplane noise. I was there for one night as I needed to be close to the airport. For this. it suffices.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Lei,Switzerland,27 Reviews,June 10  2017,9.6,Perhaps a bit expensive if you travel alone. because the rooms are all quite big.,Their dinner menu. and the big buffet breakfast with free-to-order omelette.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Warren,United States of America,1 review,June 10  2017,10,N/A,Service was great. staff was friendly. and breakfast was really nice.  Rare to see a real omelette bar included with a free hotel breakfast.  Room was very quiet. even more so considering it was right next to the airport.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,William,France,13 Reviews,June 6  2017,6.3,it should be noted that this hotel has 'no parking' ( receptionist) but for $44 they have immediate valet parking. I thought I saw on booking.com that there was free parking. That price for parking is too much! If you are just stopping a night or two. better to rent your car after you check out (rental car center a 2 min walk) and take the hotel shuttle or rental car shuttle (much more frequent) from the Airport to get to the hotel.Also. after leaving. I saw the hotel charged me $20 more/room than the booking.com rate (both in USD before all taxes) so that is also a rip-off.,Good location but...
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Herbert,Netherlands,10 Reviews,June 6  2017,3.3,The room was spacious. but not particularly comfortable. especially for 320 USD / night. Everything was rather old fashioned as well. The WIFI was a nuisance as it needed me to register into some nonsense system. Apparently I got a slow connection. for normal 2017 speeds I needed to pay extra. There was a shuttle to bring me to LA Airport. but when I didn't know the gate. the bus driver got fussy. In general the personnel had poor manors.,The room was spacious. the staff took the effort to make sure I woke up in time to catch my flight.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Anne,United States of America,3 Reviews,June 4  2017,9.2,There was only valet parking available.,The staff. from the valet (Mike). to the front desk clerk. to the dining room waitress. to the housekeepers were incredibly nice and supportive. The room was clean. the beds and pillows were very comfortable and the tvs were great!
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Jennifer,United States of America,1 review,May 30  2017,7.5,There was a $44 per night valet charge to park a car with no other options. Knowing this would have definitely swayed my selection of hotels based on overall price.,Breakfast was super! Omelet station was tops.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Deborah,United States of America,1 review,May 23  2017,9.6,Bed was not quite as firm as I preferNo free weights and sparse equipment in  gym,Excellent breakfasts in  lovely atrium area Staff very helpfulRoom very attractive Accessible facilities excellent
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Susan,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 20  2017,8.3,Scrambled eggs on the hot line I ate were a bit watery and potatoes not quite done. Prices for Dinner were too high for a hotel restaurant. We went elsewhere and faired better I think. AC was quiet but a little challenging to adjust temp to just where you want it.  Getting there was challenging because we relied on Google Maps.  Better to call the hotel for detailed directions.  Or follow signs to airport and the allow Google to re-route.,Daughters omelet was fantastic. Oatmeal Bar really appreciated. Much better than other hotels for breakfast in general. Beds were great and slept well. Loved the light blocking shades. Shuttle to airport worked early well.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Steven,Ireland,1 review,May 17  2017,3.3,Room was noise  (ac). Wardrobe doors hanging off. Then in morning  staff tried to change me an extra 120 dollars than price arrange via your Web site. Really poor experience and not happy.,Nothing. okay near airport.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Hanneli,Brazil,64 Reviews,May 6  2017,9.6,They almost charged a different price from what I got here at booking.com. Be aware of that.,Huge rooms. super comfortable bed. Super clean. The breakfast is also great and it is included in the price.ProTip to get the free shuttle if you arrive on terminal E: when you arrive at Logan airport. head to the arrivals area and find the information desk. On the right side of it. there should be two panels. with a phone attached to them. Go to the panels. Hotels -&gt; Embassy suites and find "call the property". Press the red icon once and pick the phone (even though the usability is terrible. it works). It will call the property for free and then you can request the shuttle
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Isaiah,United States of America,1 review,May 1  2017,7.5,I didnt like that the hotel only had valet parking. And again that my reservation was never recieved by the hotel from booking.com,I did not like that i had to call the hotel to confirm my reservation only to find out that my room was not booked at all. I will not be using book.com again.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Quino88,United States of America,4 Reviews,April 25  2017,6.3,It's too far from anything in Boston. so you have to get there by car. There's not free parking in the area and they charge you $44 for the overnight parking. It's ridiculous. I will never come back to this hotel. it's always a lot more money than expected just in parking.,The Hotel is massive and the rooms are very well equiped.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Morten,Denmark,1 review,April 24  2017,7.5,The breakfast were very identical from day to day. The hotel in general is a little last year ind design. interiour etc.,Perfect location for drop off of rental cars with an easy walk back to the hotel. Metro is located a block or two from the hotel with Easy access to city centre. The pool is children friendly and I enjoyed the hot tub while looking out for the kids. Wonderful omelettes at the breakfast buffet.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Oksana,United States of America,3 Reviews,April 18  2017,10,N/A,Free breakfast was excellent. very convenient for family with children.

Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Robert,United States of America,3 Reviews,April 11  2017,7.9,WIFI total hassle. Couldn't work it. One employee said it would cost $20!! But then another called back and said no. no. I had been given the code. which was true.  The directions were unclear with two portals for some reason (AT&amp;T and Hilton) that didn't pop up and I could never work it.  By now I really expect WIFI to be good. easy and free. This was a negative for me.  Also. weird carpet texture in hallways made it difficult to roll luggage. Overall I would return for an airport  overnight.,Generous hot breakfast. Excellent proximity to public transportation.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Linda,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 9  2017,10,Tables in Dining Area were not washed . We ate lunch.

Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,William,United States of America,1 review,April 8  2017,2.5,This property is run down. It's filthy and it doesn't deserve to be part of the Hilton family of hotels. I actually confronted the front desk staff about my observations. I even showed them photos I took of trash in the customer elevator and on the carpeting in the hallways. The response bordered on laughable. They did nothing but make excuses for what was obvious neglect. This hotel is disgusting. It is certainly not worth the money they charge for a room. Do yourself a favor and take a 20 minute ride on the Blue Line to downtown Boston and get way more for your buck.,Breakfast was just OK
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Anonymous,United States of America,4 Reviews,April 8  2017,7.1,The hotel is run down and outdated for the price.  We couldn't even sit on the couch because it was overused and the cushions sunk below the frame.  (See attached image)  The location is walking distance to the T line but in severe weather we had to utilize the shuttle and it was a lot of back tracking as it only operates in one direction.  The hotel is tucked down a side street behind the rental car facility.,Friendly &amp; courteous staff.  Amenities and location perfect for travel (airport and public transport into the city).  Room service was prompt and the fish and chips were delicious!  The evening reception of veggies. cheese &amp; crackers looked nice and many were enjoying it - we didn't partake. but would have been a nice option had we planned it.

Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Catherine,United States of America,1 review,April 6  2017,4.6,I found dirty plates at both the breakfast bar  and snack bar in the afternoon several times. I stayed in the Boston Logan location and they said that they are by law not allowed to serve free alcohol. which is usually complimentary with the snack bar in the afternoon. But we could pay for it?????,It was nice that the breakfast was included and afternoon snacks. The staff were very nice and accommodating.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Jason,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 5  2017,10,The location was a little out of the way but the  amenities made up for it.,The staff was nice the food was delicious and the facility was very clean I would definitely recommend staying
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Christy,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 5  2017,10,Restaurant prices seemed high for what you got. Free breakfast was good but food could have been a bit warmer.,Very convenient to the airport and hotel's free shuttle to/from was excellent. Easy to stay here and then use public transportation to get around town. In the past. we've always stayed downtown but with the ease of getting to/from downtown. we will likely stay near the airport from now on.

Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,March 27  2017,8.3,Although my request for a late check out so I could have a place to pump breast milk was ultimately granted after I emailed the address provided for concerns that this was provided. it's unfortunate that front desk staff (including the manager) didn't feel they could accommodate the request.  I believe they handled my request appropriately at that point. but it makes me wonder if there simply isn't a policy that's been communicated so that all nursing mothers (including employees) can experience reasonable pumping accommodations.,Omelet station for breakfast was great!  Staff were courteous!  Bed was lovely and comfortable!
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Haim,Israel,16 Reviews,March 26  2017,7.5,We where three and  booked a mini-suite.The Sofa bed in the living room turns to be a bed BUT it is so uncomfortable that it is not usable,Nice return for the price.Location is perfect for flyers.

Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Anonymous,United States of America,7 Reviews,March 21  2017,7.5,Stayed twice recently. stays 2 weeks apart. First stay was excellent in every regard. Second time restaurant was a  miserable failure with poor service when there was any at all.  We left (and paid) with 1/2 our meal not delivered.  Complained to front desk - woman behind us in line was there to complain of the same thing.  Later encountered a group of 6 talking among themselves about how they had walked out after being unable to be served. Front desk tried three times to get restaurant manager.finally sent someone. Result? Indifference.  Following day contacted an assistant manager we had met previously- he did his best to "make it right" and to have the situation fully reviewed.  With any luck it will  be corrected.,Airport shuttle was excellent

Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,William,United States of America,1 review,January 31  2017,10,A better or clearer schedule for the shuttle. We got to the airport a little later than we usually do. But it was OK. The airport was not crowded and the TSA lines were very short.,We liked that you had a hospitality table in the evening. a restaurant in the hotel so that we didn't have to go out in the cold for dinner and a very completed breakfast menu.
Embassy Suites Boston at Logan Airport,Michael,United States of America,1 review,January 30  2017,6.3,Restaurant service on the first night was dreadfully slow.

Boston Christopher,Jodie,United Kingdom,1 review,October 31  2017,9.2,N/A,The apartment was easily accessible by a door code allowing us to check in and out on our own. It was clean and had modern touches inside. It was excellently located being a stones throw from the famous Charlieâ€™s Sandwich Shoppe. down the road from Wallyâ€™s famous jazz cafe and walking distance to a shopping mall. the common and into the centre in minutes. Despite the central location thereâ€™s a residential feel about the area making it a very comfortable place to stay. Additionally to this Helen and her staff went above and beyond when we had a mishap and left our passports in the room to help us have these sent next day delivery to our next hotel in another city.
Boston Christopher,Sharon,United Kingdom,35 Reviews,October 10  2017,5.0,No receptionist - entry was by number code. Small room.

Boston Christopher,Kalissa,United States of America,10 Reviews,September 13  2017,9.6,The fridge was very noisy. and the room too cold. but we didn't find the AC control anywhere in the room to adjust to a comfortable temperature for us. Those should be easy fixes for the property though to make the stay better for other people.,Amazing location. so easy to get around walking or taking public transportation. Also very easy to get in and out of building and room with keyless entry. Place was very clean and organized. The staff we've talked to from the beginning were all very nice. polite and helpful. Great and quick communication about our reservation from the time of booking through the end.

The instructions on getting in were very clear and we had no problem following them.
Boston Christopher,Timofei,United States of America,9 Reviews,September 10  2017,4.6,Cleanliness is very questionable. Linens are not very fresh and new. they didn't even have a normal blanket. just one weird plaid.Very noisy refrigerator.No way to tune AC.Also. due to the type of the building. you can be unlucky with your neighbours and hear them all night long.Pretty pricey for this quality of place.,Location is really great.
Boston Christopher,Ellen,United States of America,1 review,September 7  2017,5.4,I felt that my room was fairly dirty and beat up upon arrival. my bedding had weird stains on it and was worn out. the walls had handprints and scuffs all over them. It was also very difficult to get my suitcase up the winding narrow staircase to my second floor room since I was traveling alone and had a very large bag. I also couldn't figure out how to control the AC. so it was on full blast the whole time.,I loved the fully functional kitchen and plenty of pots and pans. utentils. and dishes to use. There was even a toaster oven! The bathroom was also nice and very clean.

Boston Christopher,Margot,Netherlands,17 Reviews,July 30  2017,7.5,It is a bit noisy. but Boston as a city is a place with a lot of noise.

You are near the fine art museum. fenway park and the city centre ( all within 10 minutes by bike). The service was also fine. If we had a question or problem. we could e-mail and we always got an answer and a good solution.

Convenient grocery store just opposite the street and few nice restaurants and bars close by.
Boston Christopher,Joseph,United States of America,5 Reviews,May 6  2017,9.2,I had trouble connecting to the wifi - probably my phone's fault.  Many channels on the tv were inaccessible.  The Boston Christopher apartments on St. Botolph Street have an elevator and access to a gym in the basement. but the ones on Columbus Ave don't.,Tidy. nice apartment in great neighborhood of red brick townhouses.  I stayed in room 7 at 476 Columbus Ave. which has an excellent view of the 200-year-old stone Union Church across the street. and the skyscrapers behind.

It was still function-able and clean. but the toilet was a little faulty in flushing. There is no elevator. but I knew that well in advance of booking. The front desk was kind and helpful. I still plan on booking another stay sometime in the future.,The room was quaint and cute. I adored the built in fireplace. the bed was really comfortable. the kitchen was way more than I expected and really enjoyable. I was surprised to find real coffee mugs in the cabinets. The people were really friendly. helpful. and patient. I had a wonderful experience and plan to go back again next year.
Boston Christopher,Carl,United Kingdom,19 Reviews,April 3  2017,7.5,Could be some slight additions to help such as a bottle opener and corkscrew.

A Liquor store next door.
Boston Christopher,Aaron,Australia,10 Reviews,April 1  2017,8.3,Nothing. Note that it is a unstaffed apartment complex so you are emailed access codes a few weeks before the check-in date.,Great location in South End (5min walk to BackBay station and Prudential Centre for shops. restaurants and subway). room was well appointed and comfortable. some basic breakfast items included. free laundry is very handy. had no problems with the wifi internet at all (not sure what other reviewers are talking about!) and Giacomo's restaurant just up the street is amazing (can be a wait for a seat but they do do takeaway)
Boston Christopher,Iolanda,Spain,22 Reviews,April 1  2017,7.1,No gel or shampoo in the shower. Could be a bit cleaner.,Location is good and public transportation is close. Very easy to access the appartment with the instructions they give.
Boston Christopher,Michael,United States of America,4 Reviews,March 27  2017,10,Cleaning was adequate. but not stellar: put a hand between sofa cushions and you never know what you might find there ... Cheerios. 2015 concert tickets. parking receipt. etc.,Terrific location. Local staff very helpful and accommodating in answering questions and solving problems. Keyless (keypad) entry system a convenience.
Boston Christopher,Lukas,Slovakia,7 Reviews,March 20  2017,9.2,we found the bed a bit uncomfortable,great location close to subway station. walkable to city center. room was little small but had everything you need. staff very kind and helpful.  nice rooftop terrace. unfortunately the weather was too cold to enjoy it more. definitely recomend
Boston Christopher,Anonymous,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,February 20  2017,8.3,Water pipes are incredibly noisy all night,Great little apartment with everything needed. Fire didn't work and they got someone to come around asap
Boston Christopher,Marco,Italy,2 Reviews,February 10  2017,5.0,The room wasn't properly clean. I had to remove the heavier blanket as it was clearly not washed. You can ear everything from the other rooms. and fridge and water pipes are old and noisy.,The location is very convenient. close to a shopping mall and to subway.
Boston Christopher,Christian,United States of America,1 review,January 27  2017,9.2,We could word-for-word hear everything and everyone on our floor.,The price was really reasonable and only short walking distance from literally everything. Subway stations situated nearby. The rooftop patio. plus the patio shared with another unit were a huge plus!
Boston Christopher,Darcey,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,January 25  2017,7.1,I was on the third floor which meant having to lift a very heavy suitcase up 3 flights of stairs (think of it as a workout!) I'm a light sleeper so found the fridge in the room a little noisy.,Having the small washing machine and dryer downstairs was really handy as it meant not having to find a laundrette (although there is one over the road). Nice and quiet location which felt really safe.
Boston Christopher,Boyd,Australia,8 Reviews,January 19  2017,10,N/A,Very spacious. clean and modern studio. The bed was very comfortable. The area is beautiful and close to train stations and shops. so we loved exploring the neighborhood.
Boston Christopher,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,January 15  2017,2.9,Property in terrible condition. needs a good clean. Don't use the lanudry we had all our clothes stolen while they were getting washed. The property is not secure and lots of homeless people can access the common areas. It was very cold when we stayed the heating controls are at ceiling level " no joke see the photo" The gas fire when lit causes the carbon monoxide alarm to go off. when reported was advised only to use the fire for one hour each day. Tried to arrange a late check out but got no response to the request. This place could be good but unfortunately it falls well below expectations.,Location is good.
Boston Christopher,Kayla,United States of America,1 review,January 13  2017,7.9,Fireplace didn't work.Parking sucks (but to be fair. we we warned)UNDERWEAR FROM PREVIOUS GUESTS LEFT INSIDE DRESSER!!!! Called to let staff know. but all they were able to do was apologize. Would have been nice to receive something complimentary. Maybe some extra snacks? Nope.Everything else was fine. clean. comfortable.,Comfortable. Rooftop access. Waking distance to restaurants and stores. Nice area.
Boston Christopher,Kathryn,Australia,2 Reviews,January 10  2017,9.2,N/A,When we arrived we opened the door to find that other people were already staying in the suit!  Luckily the staff sorted it out and we ended up in a better suit.  Very nice - we would have happily stayed longer.
Boston Christopher,Daniel,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,January 5  2017,7.9,There always seemed to be some noise rumbling on inside the room - it was either the fridge. the water pipes in the walls. the heating creaking. or even the neighbours TV on the other side of the wall. I'm a light sleeper but even my partner had troubles sleeping and it usually takes a lot to wake him! Was such a shame.,Location was about a 10 minute walk to Copley Sq and even less to the Back Bay Transit station. There was filter coffee and some basic breakfast foods available complimentary. Very convenient.
Boston Christopher,Rachel,Australia,2 Reviews,December 14  2016,10,The apartment exceeded expectations. The only annoying thing was the laundry only being open at certain hours in the afternoon with only one washer and dryer available to guests.,Loved the close location to downtown and it's easy access to public transport. The apartment was very clean and modern. and the building facilities were great. Would definitely stay here again over a hotel.
Boston Christopher,John,United States of America,4 Reviews,December 5  2016,8.8,What's not to like? A brownstone. iconic Boston neighborhood. All awesome.,Comfortable apartment with fireplace. very comfortable bed. nice towels and sheets.great location. Snacks. coffee. tea... everything was great. A beautiful location. We felt like we lived in Boston for three days.
Boston Christopher,Elspeth,Canada,1 review,December 5  2016,6.7,No Wifi unless we sat outside the top floor unit on the stairway...even then it was sporadic. The staff came over and said they had internet but even in front of her. we showed that we didn't have Wifi service for our laptop or either of our two cell phones.We had to call staff to come again about the heat (no controls in the apartment) and it was VERY warm.Also. the TV didn't work but staff fiddled around the back and connected some wires or cords. then it was fine.The window opening out onto the fire escape was stuck open (unsecured) so staff had to fix that as our belongings were in the rooms.,Location. clean. kitchen. comfortable bed.
Boston Christopher,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,December 2  2016,5.5,Windows did not keep out the cold wind we experienced for the first couple of days four stay. One sash in the living room was not even properly seated in its frame.Dust clods hanging from the ceiling fan in the bedroom were a little off-putting.,N/A
Boston Christopher,Elaine,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,November 17  2016,9.0,Restricted availability of laundry facilities - only available between 5pm and 7am.,Great location. The Studio had all the facilities we needed. The roof terrace was excellent with brilliant views of the city.
Boston Christopher,Liver,United States of America,1 review,November 16  2016,7.5,could use a good cleaning overall especially the bathroom shelves over toilet and walls. Need floor to be cleaned better.,bed was very comfortable. good location
Boston Christopher,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,November 9  2016,7.9,Fluffy eggs?  There were no eggs.  The bed was a little hard to get into because it was high off the floor.  Staff?  There was no on site staff.Could use a channel listing to go with the TV and a warning that the toilet doesn't stop running unless you lift the handle after pushing it down.Could use more breakfast items.,The entrance security system to the building and the room worked just as promised.  It was a safe area of the city.  Not much noise from the other rooms.  Market just across the street
Boston Christopher,Charles,United States of America,1 review,November 8  2016,9.6,All furniture was comfortable but one chair was worn and pealing. Didn't have a map and brochures of the city as promised.,Loved the home feel great convenient location.  Great roof top view. Clean and presentable. Available to call. Laundry area a plus.
Boston Christopher,Campbell,Australia,1 review,November 4  2016,7.9,Initially the wifi was terrible. but they moved me to another (better) room and the wifi was fine. They said they're getting it fixed. The staff were helpful and sorted this out for me.,Good set up. easy access. nice furnishings abd environment. staff helpful and sorted out the problem I had
Boston Christopher,Christine,United States of America,1 review,October 30  2016,10,The WiFi connection was unstable and wasn't working as well as we would have liked,The bed was so comfortable and the room was impeccable clean upon arrival.  The housekeeping staff was so polite...even though we were an early arrival! The rooftop deck was AMAZING... probably my favorite thing.   My boyfriend and I will definitely be using your facilities in the future!
Boston Christopher,Suzanne,Australia,12 Reviews,October 23  2016,7.9,Only one lounge chair in small room meant we mostly sat on the bed. Very noisy fridge which revved for 30 minutes in each hour day and night so we had to wear earplugs to sleep. We were on 3rd level with no lift so steep steps were not easy with luggage. 3 lights in the bathroom had blown. no room service for bathroom item replacements during our week stay. Initially the room was cool and comfortable temp but then on day 3 of our stay became very warm and we had no air conditioner controls in our room. Kitchen items were very sparse eg we had to purchase a can opener.,Short walk through park to Massachusetts Ave station and easy walk to parts of beautiful Boston city. galleries. supermarket and cafes. Free laundry downstairs. very comfy bed. Staff were helpful in getting us into our room early in the day because our flight got us to Boston in the morning and in getting us secure Wifi connection.
Boston Christopher,Alice,United Kingdom,12 Reviews,October 18  2016,9.2,For the money paid for the apartment we would have expected more from the bathroom. It is dated so makes the bathroom look dirty. and the shower/bath is very small. The noise at night from sirens can be constant and very loud. so if you aren't used to 'city' sounds then take ear plugs!,The size of the apartment is perfect. it was very clean and you are provided with a lot of good quality breakfast goods. The location is in walking distance to plenty of good restaurants and about 15 mins to the public library. The roof terrace is lovely!
Boston Christopher,Norafiandy,Australia,5 Reviews,September 23  2016,7.5,Too hot in summer/early fall. There's a fan provided in the bedroom but no cooling system in the living room/kitchen. Made unsuccessful attempts to open windows. No elevators. but we stayed on the first floor. Carpet in the living room needs proper cleaning.,Close to prudential centre and station. Area was nice and quite. French restaurant next door was very nice too. Good amenities provided. Spacious.
Boston Christopher,Danielle,United States of America,5 Reviews,September 11  2016,10,N/A,Room nice and clean. rooftop patio fantastic. Staff was superb. even accommodating my early arrival. Can't beat this location. Will definitely stay again!
Boston Christopher,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,August 31  2016,9.5,As I'd read in other reviews. the lack of lift was a pain as it was 9 short flights with very heavy bags. but I've no idea where they'd put a lift if they were to add one and the staircase was plenty wide enough to allow for cases.The room was everything you'd expect. but the Wi-Fi was dodgy. I had to keep going out to the stairs to get it to connect.,I was really really glad. after an 8-ish hour flight landing in the evening. to find juice and cereal bars in the room when we arrived. Made life a lot easier.It was easy enough to find. just a short walk from the T. and easy to get in.
Boston Christopher,Romain,France,13 Reviews,August 28  2016,9.6,Internet connection was really poor. almost inexistent.,Nice location. comfortable room. close by all necessary transportations for heading Boston downtown.
Boston Christopher,Jessica,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,August 8  2016,8.8,N/A,The customer service was brilliant and the staff were always available by email. We also were able to check in early and leave our bags with their sister property just down the road. Cannot fault the service. it was fab.
Boston Christopher,Liam,Ireland,5 Reviews,August 6  2016,8.8,The stairs with a heavy bag was a challenge. but you can't have it allA tip would be to have a note of where the grocery store. drugstore and maybe a few convenient low cost restaurants are nearby. but again this is an extra,We liked that we had a space that was our own but at the same time was well managed.Wifi was excellentReally restful atmosphereStaff were very supportive when we told them our flight was cancelled when we went back to collect our bags.
Boston Christopher,Lisa,Canada,1 review,July 24  2016,7.1,Facility was somewhat run down. Bathroom had cracked tiles and livingroom chair had peeling leather seat.  Not as clean as I would expect.,Location was excellent.
Boston Christopher,Theresa,Bermuda,5 Reviews,July 14  2016,2.9,The room was really too small for two people. There was NO AIR CONDITIONING!! There was a noisy fan in the closet. There was no maid service (I knew that before booking). so adequate sheets and towels were there for the two night stay. The wifi SUCKS! We NEVER got connected. The area rug was badly stained.,The location was within walking distance from town.
Boston Christopher,Natasha,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 10  2016,7.9,Clean yet not so clean. I found hair in the bathroom sink and shower. There was also a cockroach. I wish there was a tv with dvd. The room was a bit cold. wish I was in control of the temperature however comforter and extra blankets were available.,The location was perfect. A 10 minute walk to 2 major T stops. There were breakfast snacks provided. The kitchen great if you are in the mood to cook. Full size fridge.
Boston Christopher,Lauren,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,July 4  2016,7.0,Wifi was free but awful. tried several times and did speak to staff but there was no solution except to try again. This didn't work and so virtually non existent. The welcome folder was not in our room so arriving at night and with no internet we were somewhat concerned about where we were and which way to go etc. This improved understandably in the morning but the local area info or at least a map would have helped.,Kitchen was adequate for a short stay of ours (3 days). Location is very good. Quiet leafy street no problem with sleeping etc.
Boston Christopher,Anonymous,Finland,2 Reviews,June 27  2016,8.0,We had to unplug the fridge as it kept such a horrible noise. Besides that. the building was surprisingly quiet and we were able to sleep without earplugs.,Our studio room was much nicer than we expected based on previous reviews. The room was cosy. and there was well enough space for two. Temperature in the bedroom was just fine even though we weren't able to control the air condition.
Boston Christopher,Vonda,United States of America,1 review,June 20  2016,7.9,Not really able to regulate the temperature in the apartment. There was a ceiling fan in the bedroom that was nice.  At night it's pretty quiet but when traffic starts up it wakes you up with cars honking.  The building is older so there are a lot of narrow stairs to navigate with luggage.,It's in a great location. You are 2 blocks from a shopping center at the Prudential building and the subway stop. There's a small market across the street and we walked to a Trader Joes for other groceries. If you like a longer stroll you can walk to the Public gardens and Boston Common from the apartment.  The rooftop offers a great view.
Boston Christopher,C,Australia,1 review,June 11  2016,4.6,lots of stairs to carry luggage up. place was not clean and found hair on the bed and in the bathroom. they also gave me the wrong unit number so the code to enter did not work &amp; when i tried to call the office they didnt answer. after several attempted i finally got onto someone who directed me to the correct unit.,location was good
Boston Christopher,Lisa,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,June 11  2016,8.5,Room was an ok size although very warm despite the ceiling fan.,Great location with a real neighbourhood feel.  Good food options very close especially SRV for dinner and Cafe Madelaine for breakfast pastries....get there early or they will be sold out!
Boston Christopher,Teresa,United States of America,1 review,June 10  2016,10,The stairs could be a little tough sometimes. Luckily we traveled light and wore comfortable shoes.,It was a very clean room and well stocked with towels. toiletries even some snacks and drinks. The bed was excellent. very comfortable. The location was great because we needed to be near public transportation.
Boston Christopher,Kate,Canada,2 Reviews,May 24  2016,9.6,N/A,Bed was comfy. other guests were quiet. neighbourhood was quiet and safe. little extras like oatmeal cups were very much appreciated. Would have been nice to have tourist maps of Boston available but folder in room was a very good start.
Boston Christopher,Rebecca,United Kingdom,1 review,April 28  2016,9.2,Street was quite noisy and window in bedroom a little drafty. Bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper.,Location was great. Lots of space inside apartment for two people. Extra blankets and pillows available to be as comfortable as possible. Was like having your own apartment in Boston.
Boston Christopher,Mike,Germany,1 review,April 20  2016,8.3,Walls are thin. hope you have quiet neighbours.The WiFi is mainly useless,Location very nice.Room is nice.clean. and well equipped. We liked our stay
Boston Christopher,Robert,Canada,25 Reviews,April 5  2016,5.5,No parking close by and even stopping the car to get the bags out is difficult at that point on the street. Bed and bedroom were small. No elevator.,Location. Being able to make our own breakfast - and there was a small grocery store across the street.
Boston Christopher,James,Australia,9 Reviews,February 7  2016,8.8,Internet wifi was a bit hit and miss. You could not rely on it if you were expecting important emails etc. We used coffee shops wifi instead.,Great place. Very comfortable little apartment for a great price. Very clean. Fantastic location and short walk into the Boston CBD.
Boston Christopher,Kate,Australia,1 review,January 7  2016,9.5,The wifi was really slow - to the point we gave up and walked across to the Prudential Centre to use the wifi at Barnes &amp; Noble.The bedspreads weren't warm enough and we had to crank the heating.,Loved the location. privacy and space.  Great shower and lighting in the bathroom.  Proximity to everything - including public transport and cabs. whole foods market and great shopping mall.  Property was quiet and very safe and secure.  A really impressive place that I would stay in again next time I'm in Boston.
Boston Christopher,Matthew,United Kingdom,1 review,December 29  2015,9.6,N/A,Customer service was 2nd to none. our initial room had a problem with its shower. we were upgraded straight away.  With a big apology. Awesome service.
Boston Christopher,Anonymous,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,November 26  2015,9.6,No control of air con (although had fire and ceiling fan)Noise from upstairs apartment 2 nights out of 8. no carpet some footfall noise.,Excellent location.Clean and comfortable.Staff at nearby hotel with same owner helpful and allowed free bag storage on last day.
Boston Christopher,Anonymous,Australia,7 Reviews,November 18  2015,6.7,Had bad experience with the Internet not working at all.  Don't stay here if you desperately need wifi because it can't be guaranteed unless they have fixed the problem.,Rooftop views amazing. Great self-catering facilities.
Boston Christopher,Alain,France,8 Reviews,November 12  2015,6.5,Wifi was unusable (weak signal. frequent interrruptions). The walls are thin. you can't ignore what the neighbors watch on TV. The fridge is unusually noisy.,Reasonable price. in a nice neighborhood (a bit far from downtown. nearest T at 10mn). clean and functional.
Boston Christopher,Matthew,United States of America,1 review,November 8  2015,8.8,Climbing all those flights of stairs with our luggage. And elevator would've been perfect.,The room itself. We enjoyed having a kitchen and full sized fridge. It was very clean.

Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Anonymous,Singapore,31 Reviews,October 30  2017,8.3,Pricey. No bottled water. Fridge was loaded with bar menu items.,Excellent location. Subway is 150 m away. Good casual eateries all around within 5 minutes' walk. Friendly staff. Excellent view of the Commons and Charles River.  Evening wine and bites. Very Comfortable room and bed.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 27  2017,5.8,Small room with 1 bed on an air shaft for nearly $500. Pita with room service hummus was stale. Fee for WiFi which was waived when I complained. Few amenities on premises. Good location for theatre goers. We usually like Kimpton hotels but were very disappointed. Poor value and a very mediocre. There are many better options.,N/A
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,October 16  2017,8.3,On occasion waiting for thé lift was tedious. Lighting in bedroom not sufficient. Poor choice of international tv channels.,Staff incredibly friendly and efficient. Beds very comfortable. Happy hour. always a good time to meet other guests and share stories!
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Roberto,United States of America,6 Reviews,October 1  2017,6.3,Attitude of front desk people. Not courteous and too much chitchat amongst themselves when in contact with guests.,Comfort of the roomWine served to guests 5-6 PMHelpfulness of bellboys.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Phil,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,September 1  2017,9.6,the reception staff could have been a little more friendly and smiled more. they were very efficient however could have been more welcoming.,the room was very spacious and had everything I needed. the mini bar was well stocked with drinks and snacks.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,M,Austria,4 Reviews,August 24  2017,7.1,Two elevators is not enough for a building with this many floors- we were often frustrated waiting forever for the elevator. and then stopped on many floors before finally arriving. The photos online gave us the impression that it would be more luxurious than it really was. Though we had a "fancy" room. it was quite small and the value for money was not great. We had some silly issues with the key cards and telephone messages which were a bit aggravating. though the staff was helpful. The bathroom was giant but there were absolutely no places to hang towels and the shower wall was in need of some deep cleaning- it looked a bit rusty and not what I would hope for/expect in a room that cost over $300 per night. The furniture was quite scratched and also not in the condition we were expecting based on the pictures and price.,The bed was extremely comfy. the staff was friendly. The location is great and it was easy to walk to any of the popular areas.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Eric,United States of America,1 review,August 17  2017,9.6,The room was pretty small. but I am not surprised considering the location was so perfect and how nice the hotel was.,I found the location to be perfect for what I had planned on my visit to Boston. everything was a short walk. the accommodations were great. there was free wine at happy hour and a very cool speakeasy bar!
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Betsy,United States of America,5 Reviews,August 15  2017,9.2,N/A,Great location.  Conveniently ocated between two T stops so the rest of the city is easily accessible.  Love the complimentary happy hour (PM) and the coffee/tea bar (AM) provided in the lobby.  Sodas and water provided for kids and non-drinkers.  Rooms are spacious and tastefullly decorated.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Mary,United States of America,1 review,August 10  2017,9.6,N/A,Great location. Very friendly staff. Loved having water in the lobby when you came back to the hotel. Beautiful room. very comfortable bed. We were in Boston to celebrate our birthdays and when we got to our room the first night. they had champagne and cupcakes waiting for us. The bar was great but a little pricey. Definitely would recommend!!
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Carla,United States of America,1 review,August 5  2017,10,N/A,The location was great. Able to walk to multiple restaurants and attractions. Staff were friendly and helpful. The wine happy hour was also a nice touch. The room was cleaning and bed was very comfy. we also enjoyed the toiletries and they brought us a mini fridge for me to store my pumped breastmilk. I would stay with them again.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Karin,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 3  2017,8.8,I had to ask for a coffee machine to be brought up to the room because there was no other coffee available at 6:30.  Coffee in the room should be a standard feature - or else coffee available for early morning risers.,The room had a great view and was clean and spacious.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Wayne,Canada,3 Reviews,July 11  2017,9.6,N/A,Wonderful location. Two minutes to Boston Common and Public Gardens. The Freedom trail walk . basically. starts here. Twelve minute walk to Hanover St. that has an incredible selection of great restaurants. It is a six minute walk from the State St. subway station ( after you took the Blueline subway from Airport subway station 3 stops). Staff are wonderful and friendly. Free wine from 4-6 pm everyday. Everyone at the hotel made our experience truly enjoyable. Also Highball bar upstairs pours a great scotch or three..... Also if you must stop at CHEERS (we did) it is a 12 minute walk from the hotel.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Sheila,United States of America,8 Reviews,June 28  2017,9.6,Pricey. even with the discount. but the location and comfort more than made up for it.,Comfy bed. amazing view. nice shower. excellent location. fruity water available 24-7
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Judd,United States of America,1 review,June 28  2017,6.3,You even need to request a coffee maker. Towels are kept on the floor below the sink. Buy some towel racks.,Clean basic hotel with no extras that have become standard.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Alexis,United States of America,1 review,June 26  2017,9.2,Definitely should have free wi-fi without any requirements. Also was surprised that the hotel did not supply water bottles in the rooms. Seems to be standard these days especially for higher end properties.,Hotel design and small scale. Professional staff and location of hotel.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Cornelia,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 30  2017,6.3,Very minimal comforts: no coffee maker. tiny bathroom with little space to put anything; no water bottles other than the one in the minibar for $10; most hotels offer one bottle complimentary. The house bar offers hardly any food. and what there is is happy hour type fare. minimal at that too and very unlike other Kimptons. The bar is hardly a place to relax after a day in town; more like a very loud pub with lots of standing room. Cleanliness was not great: hair in bathroom; mold in bathtub; bed not nicely made but disheveled.,Location. center of downtown close to everything.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Annie,United Kingdom,11 Reviews,May 24  2017,7.1,The shower! Needed great patience to get the temperature comfortable and frankly I gave up and washed my hair in the sink and had a flannel wash. after 15 mins of trying.  My partner succeeded though after 5mins!!  You need to adjust the pressure as well...Bedside light not plugged in,Very stylish Helpful staffGood location Nice amenities
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Christopher,Canada,1 review,May 23  2017,8.8,Pay $500 a night and charge $13/day for wifi on top?  C'mon.,Location is great but necessarily tough to drive to given it's central location.  Nothing to be done about that
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,John,United States of America,1 review,May 15  2017,6.7,Stayed on the 4th floor and the bass from the bar downstairs rattled the walls until 2am.,The water pressure in the shower was amazing. Everyone was very friendly.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Robert,United Kingdom,25 Reviews,May 14  2017,9.2,N/A,They upgraded us to one of the premium rooms with a view down the river.  It made a really good hotel experience even better.  And the free coffee in the morning and wine at aperitif time is a very nice touch.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Rana,Bahrain,1 review,May 13  2017,7.1,The house keeping was disappointing because they didn't clean the bathrooms well nor pick up empty lotion bottles nor take out dirty glasses empty cheese platters . And they never replenished my coffee and cream boxes. I had to complain twice about it. The last night I was there they forgot to even put soap and body wash .,Location for me was great
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Michael,United States of America,5 Reviews,May 6  2017,7.1,$600/night for a very small room seemed pricey. but all hotels in Boston jack up prices during large conventions. graduation season. etc.  The bed has 5 legs on it that are right on the edge and hard to see - hard to no stub your toes.,Kimpton members get $10 minibar credit - so the $7 bottled water is essentially free.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Troy,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 3  2017,10,N/A,Our reservation was mixed up with the wrong dates but the manger was able to get us a room anyhow.  It was my 7 year old daughters birthday and they delivered cupcakes to the room which was very nice.  Room was spotless and beds were super comphy!
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Sue,United States of America,1 review,April 30  2017,7.1,Hard uncomfortable beds so neither of us slept well.  There were no cups in the room for coffee in the morning and I had to ask for additional toilet paper two mornings in a row.  Since this is one of the upscale hotels where internet is additional fee. no fridge/ microwave. then I expect the basics to be included without asking.,Quiet. clean. dark room for sleeping.  Large towels. quiet air conditioning &amp; good location.  There were many restaurants near the hotel.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Maria,Philippines,1 review,April 23  2017,10,Our requests for some things like: bedroom slippers and lint remover which we asked for a couple of times never arrived even if we were promised to expect them soon.  Checking out took a very long time because the hotel had changed their computer system and it was difficult trying to tally exactly how much we were to pay for our stay.Those are things we consider minor though and could easily set aside especially with the over-all experience we had.  We are sure to come back to Kimpton Nine Zero .,The service was great.  The ambiance and the vibe were all wonderful and love those special touches that make you feel at home: complimentary morning coffee and tea at the lobby as well as afternoon wine and cheese as well where you can connect with other guests.  For the day before the (Boston) marathon. we had with us a 35 time finisher who gave us very helpful insight which was a great preparation for the next day.  Hydration options were overflowing come marathon day and a souvenir photo session for the finishers await at the lobby as well.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Michelle,United States of America,5 Reviews,April 19  2017,5.0,Called down for help with dining reservations--never got a call back.Upon check in wasn't given any info about facilities in hotel. either written or verbal.Called down for extra bath towels and was told they'd be right up--came 2 hours later.Hotel felt a bit run down. used and dated.No one helped us with bags.,The rooms seemed to be pretty well insulated and quiet for sleeping. Easy walk to Boston Commons and other sites.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Martelle,United States of America,6 Reviews,April 13  2017,10,The price for valet was a little steep. but thats expected with Boston.,A very beautiful and modern property.  The staff were exceptional and provided all the help I needed during check in/out and throughout my stay.  The staff was very attentive to all my needs during my stay. they even recommended different dining options and entertainment in the area for me to do.  Every morning a continental breakfast is offered and when you get back from training/businuess at 5PM...they have wine waiting for you at door when you are getting back from a long day.  Top notch!When visiting Boston. I would definitely stay here again.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Iván,United Kingdom,42 Reviews,April 10  2017,8.3,Very expensive hotel. in every sense. Minibar prices very high. much higher than in a bar I would say. After paying quite a lot of money for my one-week-long stay they wanted to charge me for shipping a key within town. which should cost nothing.,Confortable room with nice views. I was informed that I had gotten a free upgrade wrt the room I initially had paid for.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Lehman,United States of America,1 review,April 8  2017,8.3,There was a incidental fee and they wouldn't take cash for the room which is not convenient when your bank isn't available for the next 10 miles. even with the card on file they didn't accept cash for the room at the front desk. but overall the stay felt luxurious clean and the beds were comfortable. I would stay here again,N/A
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Anonymous,Canada,2 Reviews,April 2  2017,8.8,Price was a little expensive. Not a lot of negatives but if I had to be picky. the complimentary robes were a bit stiff and scratchy.  Complimentary slippers would have been a nice addition.,Excellent location steps to subway and park (we walked to most places - hardly took public transportation); nice view of granary cemetery;  bed was comfortable; room was clean and quiet (we were on the 17th floor.. didn't hear other guests or noise from the outside besides the occasional siren or church bells). Though we didn't use it. lots of selection from the minibar. A card offering forgotten items such as a hair straightener for your stay. was a really nice touch. Would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Dreambeliever,United States of America,3 Reviews,March 24  2017,9.6,I hated the elevator key card. The room had no fridge or microwave.  Had no tea or coffee pot. Staying on the 14th floor I. A tea drinker at night and didn't have an ability to resume that ritual.,Loved the location close to city center everything was in walking distance. I also loved how clean and comfortable the room was. access to room service and free WiFi.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Kristina,United States of America,12 Reviews,March 15  2017,10,Everything was great!,The hotel is stylish and modern. Beds were very comfortable and there were nice touches (robes. toiletries). They have a free wine reception each evening! Staff was super friendly and accommodating. Location is very central and near public transportation. The bar on the second floor made excellent drinks. Despite the active atmosphere in the lobby. we encountered no noise near our room.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Amanda,Canada,2 Reviews,March 14  2017,9.2,N/A,The staff were really friendly and there were very nice touches to make you feel welcome like complimentary coffee in the morning and wine hour in the evening. Great location close to downtown with good sized room
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,GaryMerse,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,March 9  2017,10,N/A,The rooms were nice and spacious. The staff were amazing. When there was an issue with some water overflowing in the bathroom they moved me to another room straight away.10 second walk from the brilliant Beantown Pub and a 10 minute walk from Faneuil Hall Marketplace. You can spend hours walking around Faneuil Hall watching the Street Entertainers and Eating. Drinking and Shopping. The T is also great for travelling around the City and very cheap and easy to use. A great City and "A Wicked Smaht" Place to go to.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Joseph,United States of America,8 Reviews,March 6  2017,9.6,There was some road noise in the morning but it was to be expected in a prime downtown location.,Location is superb. Less than 10 minute walk from most of the Theatre District or go the other way for City Hall.  Easy access to T stations.Very nice modern amenities.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Franklin,Canada,13 Reviews,February 27  2017,8.8,This was my second visit. and again I found the breakfast not that good for the price. Charging $4.50 for a cup of filter coffee is kind of steep.,The public areas and rooms are stylish and well maintained. The hotel is very close to Boston Common and not far from two T stations.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Clement,South Africa,4 Reviews,February 17  2017,9.6,Sunday evening dining. room service as an alternative is very expensive. It was snowing outside thus options were limited,The room was very comfortable and made it easy to work from. Bed was really good
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Sara,United States of America,1 review,February 9  2017,10,N/A,We arrived at the hotel at 12 midday and left our luggage (with no problem) to go explore the city. They had no available queen bedroom at the time so they upgraded us! The staff was extremely courteous and helpful. The concierge was very insightful and friendly. As a request we asked for a picture of Nicolas Cage (really assuming the hotel staff would never comply with our silliness). but we were greeted in our room with a printout. So nice to know the staff has a sense of humor :) Overall: GREAT staff. great location. great hotel. Will definitely recommend to family and friends; as well as stay there again in our next trip to Boston.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Claire,Mexico,1 review,February 7  2017,8.8,The layout of the room did not optimise the space.,Complimentary glass of wine in the early evening each day was a nice touch.The location was really great.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Patricia,United States of America,1 review,February 1  2017,7.1,There was some black mold in shower. It should be upgraded.!!,The view of public gardens. The water in lobby. Yummy!!The room was very quiet and bed was comfy!!
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Bostonromance,United States of America,1 review,January 28  2017,9.6,Bathroom was nice but the standing shower was a little small &amp; the poor design (though aesthetically beautiful) left water on the floor after every shower.,Fantastic location. within walking distance or short subway ride away (including the airport) &amp; just a block away from Boston Common. Staff was friendly &amp; accomodating. Room had a great view. Complimentary hot chocolate in the lobby after a cold day of sight seeing. Couldn't have been happier...fantastic location for bringing in the New Year!
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Melissa,United States of America,1 review,January 27  2017,9.2,Parking is expensive. we had to wait a while to get our car. there's no welcome or info booklet in the rooms like most hotels so finding things in or close by the hotel was a challenge. I couldn't even find the ice machine for a while or how to operate the elevator at first. Needs more information like that and maybe things like local delivery places,Room decoration and comfort was amazing. Staff is super friendly. room was very clean.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Laurie,United States of America,3 Reviews,January 23  2017,9.6,N/A,This hotel does it the way it should be done! The staff was exemplary; friendly. and engaging. helpful and professional. Hotel details. from the refreshing flavored water. hot chocolate and complimentary wine in the lobby. to the yoga mat provided in the room were perfect. The location. being just steps from Boston Common. is ultra-convenient. This hotel will be my go-to whenever I stay in the city.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Seamus,Ireland,11 Reviews,January 16  2017,9.6,Nothing really.,The most warm. welcoming and helpful staff you could wish for. Some particular needs catered for most efficiently and without fuss. Dinner recommendation made and booked instantly and it was a great choice. Very comfortable clean room. with great views and lovely bathroom. Most convenient location for all downtown Boston sights and shopping. Top class!
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Jacqueline,United States of America,1 review,January 5  2017,7.5,I booked for a family of four and we did not have sheets or blankets for the pull out sofa.  When I called Guest Services it took almost an hour to get sheets for the kids. I would also note it was New Years Eve so they may have been busy but we were tired and wanted to get to sleep. Also. valet lost my car due to a mix up with tickets but they did credit me the parking fee.,Loved the location and the vibe of the hotel.  The bar was fun and had a good energy.  Food was good too.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Diana,United States of America,1 review,January 2  2017,4.6,Over run with barking dogs and dogs sitting on all the common area furniture. If the dogs were "peanuts" (peanut allergies) they would have been better managed out of respect for all guests,Not much.  Rooms were too small to move around in comfortably. Layout of shower was horrible. had to get into shower to turn on and jump out as to not get wet while water was warming up.   TV didn't work. need repair Ordered expensive cookies that came with a 6.00 tray charge and were supermarket bought cookies(really bad)!
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Jennifer,United States of America,1 review,December 27  2016,10,I personally do not like dogs in hotels because you can hear them barking from other rooms.,The location is unbeatable. The Highball Lounge is a very convenient place to have a drink. The staff was incredibly friendly. knowledgeable and accessible. They serve Caffe Vita from Seattle. awesome!
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Dorothy,United States of America,26 Reviews,November 20  2016,8.8,There is not much of anything to complain about that was the hotel's fault.  There just happened to be construction going on nearby during my stay which was on my side of the hotel and a bit noisy.,I liked the contemporary decor of this small boutique hotel. and that they offered coffee. newspapers. fruit infused waters. wine and hor d'oeuvres in the lobby morning and evening.  The lobby is intimate. like a living room. and a nice place to meet other travelers. The hotel is in a fantastic location and I had a wonderful corner room high up with great views over Boston Common.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Boston,Australia,1 review,November 14  2016,7.1,The wifi didnt work in my room - I had better connectivity in the hostel I stayed at before this place!,The shower was amazing and the bed was comfy. It was in a good location and the rooms were nice and quiet.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Ruth,United Kingdom,9 Reviews,November 14  2016,8.3,There wasn't actually anything to dislike.,Lovely atmosphere. The wine hour in reception allowed you to talk and chat with other visitors. and was a welcome after a long day of sightseeing!  Staff were so accommodating and helpful!
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Tina,United States of America,4 Reviews,November 6  2016,10,Beds could be a tad softer but that is MY preference not everyone's.,The most friendly staff I have ever encountered in a hotel.  The General Manager came up to me and my daughter and asked us about our stay and chatted with us like he knew us.  Great food at night!!!!! The best tomato bisque.  You are treated with smiles and a friendly hello.  Clean. smells great in the lobby. trendy. great value. perfect location in the City.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Mauricio,Mexico,11 Reviews,November 1  2016,10,N.A.,Great team. great place. Love Andrew (concierge). Love location. love everything. specially the personnel (always smiling and kind)!See you soon again!

Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Joost,Netherlands,38 Reviews,October 23  2016,10,We had parked the car in the Boston Commons garage and walked from there. The car access of the hotel is difficult to find. and parking is of course expensive ....,The location is superb. right next to the Boston Common and Park T stop. They gave us an upgrade with a nice view of the city. Room was spacious. clean and comfortable. No coffee maker in the room. but plenty of coffee available in the lobby. Also free newspapers. Friendly staff.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Radu-mihail,Switzerland,25 Reviews,October 20  2016,8.8,Besides the price (this was to be expected. this being Boston). I don't have any complaints.,Excellent location.Nice and cosy room with a great bathroom.Friendly and helpful staff.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 15  2016,9.2,Could have been cleaner. somewhere in the room let guests know where the ice machine is. The robes aren't soft,The steel cut oats were cooked perfectly.ALL the staff were friendly. professional and helpful. Loved that there's a game room.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Elise,United States of America,1 review,October 6  2016,10,N/A,We found the staff to be exceptionally friendly and helpful. Rooms are comfortable and spotless. Location is perfect. Centrally located so easy to get to other Boston neighborhoods.Enjoyed the complimentary coffee in the pleasant lobby in the AM and stepped outside to take a lovely walk across the street in the Commons park. Highly recommend!
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Megan,United States of America,1 review,October 4  2016,5.4,Went to get my car from valet parking and the guy couldnt help us because he was in a fight with someone on the street.  Then walked right passed us when it was done.,N/A
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Joseph,United States of America,1 review,October 3  2016,9.2,The only knock (and I should've known better coming from NYC). was the exorbitant parking charge (close to $40 for an overnight stay). I get that its smack in the middle of a big city and my only beef is that it should be disclosed on website (the amount and that it's not included in the price of the room).,The employees were outstanding and the room was comfortable. tasteful and spotless
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Michael,Germany,1 review,September 30  2016,5.0,Price was to high for a room which does not realy have daylight. Window was facing the wall of the opposit building. I stayed the days before at the Marriott Courtyard Hotel. The hotel was not that central as the Kimpton but only 5 min away from Boston Common. The room was a comparable to Kimpton but with more daylight and with a cheaper room rate.,Service was friendly. I liked the possibility to rent a bike for free.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Diane,Canada,1 review,September 19  2016,10,N/A,Arnaldo the manager went above and beyond to make sure our stay was an enjoyable experience. The entire staff at this lovely hotel was attentive. helpful and friendly. It was our first time staying at The Nine Zero but it certainly won't be our last!
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Zheng,United States of America,7 Reviews,September 18  2016,9.6,Bed was luxurious but a slightly strange combination of hard and soft that made it a bit difficult to sleep deeply.  Toilet seat a little small for such a well-appointed bathroom.,Stylish. classy. well-appointed city hotel near the airport and right downtown. with a nice vibe.  Great rooms. good service.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Suzanne,United States of America,1 review,September 16  2016,9.2,Nothing. really. I spent 5 nights here. and have been traveling to Boston for &gt; 20 yrs.. Excellent place!,Absolutely quiet in my room. despite being in midst of busy urban area. GREAT location - can walk everywhere.Very close: lg. movie theater. pharmacies. many restaurants/pubs from low-level to 5 star. main T hub just across street. pretty walks to Boston Commons and garden/Copley Sq/ the waterfront/Beacon Hill/Freedom Trail/Aquarium
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Anna,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,September 15  2016,9.2,Shower leaked over bathroom floor. Slightly overpriced - although hotels seem to be extra expensive in Boston.,Excellent location. comfy. clean. peaceful and spacious. Complimentary coffee and wine hour. friendly staff.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Barbara,Australia,5 Reviews,September 15  2016,9.6,No restaurant for dinner. however staff directed us to lovely restaurant nearby,Wine and nibbles at 5pm for guests. Andrew. the concierge was absolutely fantastic and helped sort out Ticketmaster tickets and suggested and booked 2 excellent restaurants.  And reception and cleaning staff also friendly and helpful.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Sandrine Paris,Germany,37 Reviews,September 15  2016,7.1,Breakfast a la carte. no time for me in the morning and limited option. Lack of kettle and free coffee and tea in the room but a kettle was brought to me upon my request which was appreciated without mug and tea,Location. Welcome staff. The free glass of wine at 5 pm upon return. Gym open 24h. Room very quiet as I did requested
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Aimee,United States of America,1 review,September 8  2016,8.3,Everything that was described as provided should have included the words "for purchase".  Also even though I called to ensure I could get a crib in the room we still waited an hour for a crib. while the little one was very much in need of a nap.  The staff didn't seem like they really knew what was going on when it came to getting people from the street to check-in with the valet to getting checked in to getting to a room.  That whole process was very disorganized. There were no highchairs available at the breakfast area.   It is not a family friendly hotel.,It seemed like it would be great for bushes travelers or a vacation without kids.  The rooms were nice and clean and the location was great. They give you a 15% discount at the valet if you drive a hybrid. (They valet sent me back to the desk after I checked out to get a refund. so you have to ask the front desk)
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 6  2016,9.6,Led light "display" in room that we couldn't figure out how to shut off...so it wasn't a dark room which we are used of.,Staff was great!
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 31  2016,9.6,No complaints at all toward the hotel. Will definitely stay there again. I was under the impression though by the way the picture looked online and the room I reserved that I did not get the corner room shown on the website. with the two walls of windows overlooking downtown. I was disappointed in that. but maybe misread the room type. My view of downtown was beautiful though so it was fine.,The bed. linens and pillows we're extremely comfortable. So much I found the website to order the sheets and pillow.  Staff was very professional. friendly and courteous. I was impressed with how they handled the 12:45 a.m. Fire alarm situation. I felt sorry for them for having to deal with very unhappy. not understanding guests that had been waken up and having to evacuate the building. They handled it very well. from what I saw. even after being yelled at repeatedly. which I thought was completely uncalled for by anyone. We were all safe. and that is what mattered. It was an inconsiderate guest smoking in the hall that set off the alarm in a Non-Smoking hotel. That's who should be yelled at.  The location is perfect to everywhere uou want to go downtown. Short walk to Boston Commons. Boston Public Gardens. restaurants and bars. freedom trail. etc. etc
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Clive,United Kingdom,11 Reviews,August 25  2016,8.3,Quite expensive. Breakfast could have been included at the price paid.,Excellent location. very helpful and pleasant staff. Great room / bathroom and best hotel bed I've come across.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Gunnlaugur,Iceland,7 Reviews,August 23  2016,8.8,Only "A la carte" breakfast. Would have preferred a buffet. but plenty of other options to eat in the neighborhood.,Great location in the middle of Boston and close to everything. Very easy to take the subway to Logan Airport. Very comfortable room and wonderful staff. The water and coffee in the reception area was fantastic!
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 21  2016,7.5,Hotel is expensive and top of it we had to pay $50 to park our car overnight. Despite turning the air on as high as it would go. the room never really cooled off as much as we would've liked . Would've liked a coffee maker or at least a couple of bottles of water in the room.,Staff was so friendly and helpful. room was spacious and clean. We booked this hotel because of queen sized beds. Hotel in ideal spot to walk to great restaurants and shopping. Was quiet.  didnt  hear any other guests or room doors from our room.
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Luke,Australia,5 Reviews,August 16  2016,9.2,Bed little hardNo newspaper or water left in room,Sassy and hip hotel that is a great change from The big chains that have no personality...Staff young and energetic and friendlynightly wine hour is a big hit...
Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel,Kathy,United States of America,1 review,August 10  2016,10,Nothing. Absolutely nothing.,The staff all went above and beyond when I was under the weather. Could not say enough about what excellent service and exemplary attitude that was conveyed by one and all. Don't recall ever leaving an experience feeling so positive about the environment. Hotel is quite chic and welcoming at same time.
Super Location 2 Bedroom by the Green Line with Parking Spot,Patricia,Ireland,1 review,October 2  2017,10,The entrance lobby. hall and stairs area was not very nice.,Apartment was lovely. Very clean. Comfortable beds. Kitchen well kitted out. Hosts always available by email. Excellent location
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Adrienne,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 3  2017,6.3,We did not know that this apartment was in the flight path for the airport and planes started flying at 5 in the morning! We would have picked another property had we known this. The property is advertised as providing sleeping for 5 to 6 adults. The mattress on the pullout bed is one with springs and wires and not sleepable. Our daughter slept on the couch with pillows and it was ok for one. The pillows are the cheapest possible; the toilet paper is 1-ply! We have rented many apartments around the world. This is the first one that did not have any binder. books. tour info etc. in the apartment. Yes there is a concierge who could tell us where to buy groceries and alcohol etc. but this is good information to provide. Many other places have a log where guests make recommendations of tours. restaurants etc. that they enjoyed. This place felt like it was owned by a corporation for an investment and did little to provide anything much extra other than salt and pepper. some foil and saran wrap and paper towels. For the cost of this apartment we expected a more.,Easy walking distance to train and many tourist attractions; the common area on 20th floor with free coffee machine. pool table and large TV. Very clean. Prompt replies to questions.
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Joy,United States of America,1 review,August 21  2017,9.5,A little difficult to find the carport/drop-off area at first. especially because there was some areas blocked of for some road work.  I admit to being a little nervous about check-in as this was our first non-traditional accommodation but the concierge for the apartment building was familiar with the Stay Alfred arrangements so it went relatively smoothly.  The area where you unload is a very tight alley and we felt a little pressure to be quick about unloading as other cars were trying to move through the space to get into the parking garage.Because of the layout of the apartment. while it wasn't uncomfortable. the HVAC was inconsistent from one space to the next.  The master bedroom vent directs air that somehow ricochets off the opposite wall and onto the one side of the bed- I had to switch sides with my husband as he was cold and I was warm.The mattresses seemed relatively new yet hard; the sheets were scratchy and the blankets were synthetic velour which trapped heat.An unexpected downside to staying in a spacious apartment. at least for our family. was being comfortable enough in the space to be less motivated to get out and about as quickly as when you're cooped up in a traditional small hotel room;),Having a place to land for several days as a base for travel in and near Boston was a positive.  Accommodating 2 adults and 3 teens in one place (a King. a Queen and a sofabed with 2 bathrooms) was more economical than having several hotel rooms.  Being able to cook our own breakfast instead of eating out every meal was a good start to the day.  The kitchen was beyond basic with a blender. toaster. and two different kinds of coffeemakers as well as a microwave. full-size range/oven. refrigerator. and apt-size dishwasher.  There was an in-unit laundry set-up which we used several times.  The rooftop patio with a grill. the upstairs lounge area with pool table. and the downstairs lounge area with board games (my kids played chess) as well as the fitness center (husband used it daily) were nice distractions as well.This was our first time in Boston; our main focus in choosing our accommodations were driven by finding something to keep the five of us in one space with high marks for cleanliness at a reasonable price.  The apartment was about a five minute walk to South Station for transit (Red and Silver lines. I think) which seemed to make the location easily accessible though not directly in the heart of the historical sites. Of the three types of accommodations we chose for this New England road trip. my kids preferred this apartment over our other hotel and the B&amp;B we chose later in the week.
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 10  2017,9.2,Away from tourist attractions but short commute from them.  On site parking is expensive but there is a public garage 1 block away.  Could use more lamps/lights in the unit.  Apartment layout puts second bedroom far away from master.,Location was close to the Airport and South Station subway terminal.  Restaurants and coffee shops in walking distance.  Gym and lounge on common floor was well maintained.  Washer &amp; dryer in unit.
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Anonymous,Switzerland,3 Reviews,July 17  2017,9.2,Neighbourhood is somewhat industrial and we had views on parking lots and trucks. No shopping in area. one small convenience market a couple of blocks away and only one "breakfast" venue also a couple blocks away.  Distances for shopping a bit far for non-walkers and Boston roads and streets always have traffic jams that create expensive taxi and Uber rides back to property after shopping.,N/A
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,HGH29,United Arab Emirates,3 Reviews,June 16  2017,9.6,The corridors need to be slightly ventilated or room fresheners need to be setup. Our floor was stinking of fried fish all the time; and the neighbouring residents had left their big dog out in the corridor which was intimidating and pretty scary for some of the food delivery men.,We had initially booked a 2 bedroom Penthouse Loft. but due to mix-up on the Proprty's side. we were upgraded free of charge to a 3 bedroom loft in the sister property. It was not much of an inconvenience. The flat was very good.
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Luisa,United States of America,1 review,June 16  2017,9.2,The sofa bed is  mega uncomfortable. The wires feel awful. My son complained every night. The bedrooms need another type of shades. It is too much light that makes difficult to sleee.,The apartment is beautiful. It has everything you need. The kitchen has all the tools. Washer and dryer machine with detergent included.
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Nancy Mayalu,United States of America,1 review,June 12  2017,9.6,The blinds in the bedroom were not the right type. Would recommend that the proterty owners consider a blind system that blocks out the sun more in the bedrooms. Was a little suprised at the size of some of the dogs (150+ lbs)on the property. But. that said. our stay was very pleasant.,This place was great for our family of 5. The apt was clean. comfortable. and had everything that we needed for our stay. Also loved that the location was a quick 8 min walk to the "south station" T stop. Thank you Stay Alfred!
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Jaren,United States of America,4 Reviews,April 7  2017,9.2,The only thing missing was a water filter. that would be a nice thing to have had.,The place was very nice.

A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Kim,Canada,2 Reviews,March 17  2017,9.6,the nest temp control is funky and drops a few hours after setting. and on a cold windy day as we had 2. the apartment was chilly with whistling wind leaks. No hot water in main bathroom. but tap water was hot. Not enough time to complain. No eggs/bacon type breakfast place nearby. Bring your own!Reception could not find our reservation! But keys were there! so in we went. Bring copy of your reservation!!,was able to check in a few hours early as no one was in it the night before. suite was great for 2 road warriors with 2 bath and 2 bedrooms and living area. Great parking and public areas. Will stay there again.!
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Tina,United States of America,1 review,September 15  2016,10,It had 2 thermostats unknown to us because one was in the bedroom behind the TV.   It controlled both bedrooms and  was set on a program that would turn the heat on.    We had the air set. then we would come in and it was very hot.,Excellent location and view.
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Joanna,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,August 21  2016,9.6,The one downside was that only one key was provided to use between the 5 of us - the lady on the front desk pointed out the other one was missing. I took this up with Stay Alfred via email who said they would get another key to us as soon as possible. Unfortunately this meant that we had to stick together as a group. which was against our plans as we were hoping to have some separate adult/teenage time in Boston. Sadly the key still hadn't arrived by the time we left. I wasn't impressed with Stay Alfred's attitude to this as I explained our situation but they still failed to provide us with another key to replace the missing one before we left. Thankfully this didn't spoil our enjoyment of this wonderful city!,The apartment was lovely. modern and clean with all we needed; I'd definitely recommend staying there. The location was fab; just a short walk to the river and the heart of Boston. The apartment block had a very relaxed atmosphere and was also home to private residents and their adorable dogs.
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Melissa,United States of America,1 review,August 14  2016,9.6,Stay Alfred has poor customer service. The power was shut off in one of the rooms and they didn't follow up for over 12 hours.,The apartment was clean and the bedrooms were a really nice size.
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,J_Van,Thailand,8 Reviews,August 7  2016,9.2,The bedrooms of our 9th floor unit looked directly onto a rooftop with rows of air-conditioning units. We did not spend much time in the bedrooms so this was not a problem.,Brand new apartment. with excellent WiFi.Please note that this apartment is very pet friendly. as we would meet tenants with pets in the lobby. lifts. etc.  We love pets so it did not bother us but this may be an issue with guests that are uncomfortable around pets.

A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Deanna,United States of America,6 Reviews,June 18  2016,5.4,View of city had to look over AC units and noise of construction work early in the morning. AC in second bedroom didn't work and had to use the box fan.,Kitchen and having 2 bedrooms.
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Alan,Ireland,1 review,May 31  2016,9.2,Maybe a bit more information to hand about boston. Also booked a taxi to airport with reception. After an hour it never showed up. We had to hit the streets and flag down our own taxi. A bit frustrating as it was the end of our holiday and we were rushing to get our plane.,Location was great. The view was amazing

A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Richard,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 17  2016,7.1,LOTS of construction on the building made initial entrance difficult. (Check in instruction rendered worthless by construction. Had to make entrance on opposite side of building on a different street a block away. Pressed buzzer several times before being let in. ) The appliances were dirty (coffee pot. toaster. microwave.) Part of coffee pot was missing. Master bedroom window would not close all the way ( thank God it wasn't raining but nighttime city noise was distracting with window not fully closed. ) Also. parking was tight in the garage. Spots should be assigned based on vehicle size. I have a large SUV but was given a compact spot while better. larger spots were unoccupied during my stay. I advised the desk clerk about the coffee pot and window when I left but she did not seem interested. (Didn't write issues down. didn't write down my room number. didn't apologize. Just. "ok."),I did like separate bedrooms. the view. the balcony. and the furniture.
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Contented,United Kingdom,16 Reviews,April 10  2016,9.2,Instructions for TV could have been a bit clearer for foreigners - those from USA may have understood which channels  there was access to. but we didn't.,Communal facilities were a great bonus - gym. pool table. complimentary hot drinks. super views. Kitchen was well equipped. Supermarket was over a mile away but good once we'd found it. Washing machine and tumble drier were an added bonus at the end of some hotel stays.
A Street Apartment by Stay Alfred,Yinsu,China,3 Reviews,March 19  2016,9.6,The water is usually not hot enough when we shower one after another. just need to wait for a bit.

And the public lounge is awesome. they have a pool table. a huge tv. and a great hot beverage maker.

One-Bedroom on D Street Apt 345,Michael,Australia,9 Reviews,May 18  2017,3.8,The place smells of Dog. Which is good if you have a dog. The couch was broken and collapsed when I sat on it and it just wasn't quite clean. There was not enough lights in the place and much of it looked as if it was faked for the pictures on the site. so that it looked better.The place was a long walk from the entrance and it has a view of an industrial car park.,it has a washing machine and a drier. The correspondence from the agents was good and they did respond to the broken couch quickly.The self check in was a little bit difficult as it relies on you doing a lot of the transaction yourself. which can be especially difficult if you are from overseas and don't have a good data connection.

Inn at St. Botolph,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 30  2017,9.2,If you're not used to sounds of the city and you're a light sleeper. you might want to pack some earplugs.  I did not use mine the first night and awoke a few times to street noise. but I used them the second night and slept like a baby.,Intimate boutique inn located on a lovely street in the heart of Boston. walking distance to numerous universities. the Prudential.

Inn at St. Botolph,Liz Hoscheid,United States of America,1 review,October 2  2017,9.2,"Continental" breakfast was really just bagels and cereal. However they do offer a really nice espresso machine. The manager or whoever she was was very unfriendly for a hospitality business. Also. they didn't have anything other than decaf coffee for their guests' rooms which was crazy!,The rooms are huge and beautiful. The location can't be beat. Beautiful neighborhood within walking distance to some great shopping. food and site seeing.
Inn at St. Botolph,Visiting,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 14  2017,7.0,Very expensive for 1 night. and the expense didn't include parking. that was an additional $35 a night about 3 blocks away at a garage. Breakfast was included but just ok for the steap price. being it was a self serve cinamon bagel only. in a dreary basement room.  Remembering my parents stayed here when I was in college. remembered a much different place that had a restaurant and very gracious accommodations. Found it much changed.,Good location. lovely designed decor.

Inn at St. Botolph,Gail,Germany,7 Reviews,August 12  2017,6.3,I asked in advance for a quiet room since I was arriving jet lagged and the staff reserved a room in a quiet corner on the fourth floor. But the generator on the roof was so loud it woke me up all night long. The next day. the staff offered me a different room but when I moved into after a long work day. there was a party going on next door so I slept poorly the second night too. The breakfast was free but not really much choice or anything fresh.  I like fruit and a croissant and cappucino.,The location was fantastic and the building has more charm and local flavor than all the big anonymous hotels around Copley Placeâ€”that's what I was looking for.  The staff was kind. helpful and efficient.
Inn at St. Botolph,Mc_Traveller,Ireland,7 Reviews,August 6  2017,10,Nothing,The self contained studio was perfect. why can't I find one of these every place I travel?  Top marks!  There were some issues with the key code initially but the staff about and beyond and resolved the issue.The kitchen was the perfect addition with the bonus of a great shower and generous towels with desk area.  The room gave us enough space and allowed us to process laundry before our next travel adventure.
Inn at St. Botolph,Paula,United States of America,8 Reviews,August 2  2017,8.8,The price was a bit high for an inn.,Great inn in a great location.

Inn at St. Botolph,L,United States of America,16 Reviews,July 11  2017,10,Carpets could be cleaner. but otherwise I'd overlook it for the bathrobes - which mid-end hotels in the US these days still provides bathrobes? Bathroom was a bit of a squeeze but considering the layout of the these old houses. I'd say it still works.,Surprising find for weekend getaway in the South End neighbourhood. just behind the Prudential. Lovely little brownstone Victorian townhouse refurbished into an inn. Loved that the inn did away with a traditional check in and check out which made the process so easy - digital password to let yourself in both frontdoor and room helped with the whole process and made it seem like you had your own apartment. home away from home! Not much of a staff presence but that didn't make it problem - they're just down by the basement office if you need them. Lounge had tea. coffee and snacks all times of the day which was helpful - David's tea is lovely. Not much facilities and no room service. but hey. you're right in a fantastic neighbourhood with plenty of restaurants and if you want to splurge. they have 25% discounts for the inn's affiliated (very fancy) restaurants. Room was clean and large with a sitting area and a well-equipped kitchenette. lovely and tasteful interior decor. Loved the bed with fluffy pillows - best night's sleep in a hotel in a while.
Inn at St. Botolph,Yi,Canada,1 review,July 6  2017,9.6,The building is old and has some noise coming from upper floor.,The location is fantastic. very close to the shopping mall and restaurants. The community is nice and quiet. The hotel staffs are also very good willing to help.
Inn at St. Botolph,Jonathan,United States of America,1 review,June 26  2017,10,Only complaint was that ground floor. you hear everything street level. Less against the hotel. more to do with passers by.,Stayed in room 102. ground floor. This place really makes you feel like you are a temporary resident of the Boston neighborhood.
Inn at St. Botolph,Jacqui,United States of America,1 review,May 22  2017,9.2,The air con didn't work but a lovely maintenance man sorted it and we were offered another room by your receptionist.

Inn at St. Botolph,pinfelise,United States of America,20 Reviews,February 13  2017,9.6,Water pressure not sufficient and shower head placement with shelf underneath it means getting under the water is nearly impossible.

Inn at St. Botolph,Frankie,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,November 29  2016,5.4,Staff were borderline rude - no interest in guests. One staff are pizza before her shift next to us while we had breakfast. That in itself was a little odd but made worse by the fact she did not talk to us but had music blaring. Other staff could not have had much less interestBreakfast was sterile and uninteresting. No real complaints on it. but it was expensive for a cup of machine coffee and a dry bagelVery poor value for money given how hands off they are,Fantastic location in super part of town
Inn at St. Botolph,Richard,United States of America,5 Reviews,November 4  2016,10,No complaints.,This hotel is in a very pleasant neighborhood just a couple hundred feet from downtown.  The streets are narrow and the walkways are brick.  It is quiet and charming.  There is a green jogging area running through the area.  There are several good restaurants within10 minute walks. and the Museum of a Fine Arts and Symphony Hall are within a mile as well.
Inn at St. Botolph,Anonymous,Switzerland,23 Reviews,November 3  2016,6.7,The place is overpriced for what they offer - the room is not well isolated and noisy from the street up until late in the night (we stayed on Friday &amp; Saturday). the shower was not working properly and the water was either cold or burning hot. they didn't clean our room or take the trash a single time during our stay out which is simply unacceptable at their price level. what they call a "continental breakfast" is a bag of bagels and a nespresso machine in a tiny dark room in the basement. We asked the lady at the reception if we are at the right place for breakfast and she quite arrogantly answered that if we don't like it we should use the kitchenette in the room because that's why it's there and after all this breakfast is for free - of course it's not for free. when you charge almost 500 per night for a bundled product room with breakfast. neither one is for free! Definetelly wouldn't recommend this hotel,Good location very close to shopping facilities and subway connection
Inn at St. Botolph,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,November 3  2016,9.6,We didn't get access to a parking spot in the garage (but we found a free spot on the street instead!).,We liked the layout. decor. mini-kitchen. and nearby restaurants and amenities. We also liked that it felt like an upscale studio apartment. The property was in a great neighborhood on a residential street next to a few pretty parks. and most historical and cultural attractions were within walking distance.

Inn at St. Botolph,Oslo,Norway,10 Reviews,October 29  2016,9.6,1. Upon arrival. the room smelled gas and it was really bad. I could not open the windows. The smell disappeared when I turned on the air. which is not intuitively easy to understand either.2. A little bit difficult to understand where breakfast was served. if any?,1. The room was great. huge. very clean. everything high standards. 2. I sent an e-mail on my departure day very early in the morning and I got a response just minutes later. The staff was very attentive and welcoming - when you know where to locate them. 3. The facility is mostly self served. you open the outside door and your room with a code youÂ´ll get in an e-mail when you book. Have that printed out before you travel. 4.Back Bay train station is on walking distance. and there are food stores nearby. A 7-11 store opposite side of the road.

Inn at St. Botolph,Susan,Canada,10 Reviews,October 9  2016,6.3,I was surprised not to have regular daily housekeeping services for the price we paid. I don't mind not having towels and sheets changed daily. but the beds are usually made even in a B&amp;B and garbage removed. 403 needs quite a bit of TLC.,The location was the best part of the Inn. The bed was comfortable and the kitchenette fairly well equipped although tea towels would have been better than just paper towels. The staff in the office were quite pleasant.
Inn at St. Botolph,Mark,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 3  2016,7.1,No coffee for the in room pot.  Light housecleaning in the middle of our stay (as described on the tag you leave on the door) ( should have included vacuuming and emptying the wastebaskets (3).  Instead we got fresh pillowcases. one trash emptied and no vacuuming.  We weren't slobs but anything on your shoes shows up on brown carpeting.  At 4 Bens per night the staff or management could do better.,Location and quiet
Inn at St. Botolph,Biz,Canada,1 review,September 24  2016,8.8,A little noise travel from adjacent rooms/ elevator. but probably due only to the age of the building. Not sure there's much that can be done about that. Overall very comfortable stay.,Beautiful room. great location!
Inn at St. Botolph,Anonymous,Australia,7 Reviews,September 15  2016,7.1,Although a family run hotel. we didn't find that staff were overly friendly or helpful.  The lift is extremely noisy particularly at night!,The room was spacious and nicely decorated.  The location is great!
Inn at St. Botolph,Kim,New Zealand,20 Reviews,July 25  2016,7.9,There was a loud knocking against the wall near the head of the bed that came at various times over the 3 days in Room 104 plus the bed makes a noise every time you move (broken welding?) so would not recommend this room. Problem with the clothes dryer in the laundry.,Helpful staff. well appointed room.

Maybe a little bit more variety would of been nice.,Great location; near many desirable restaurants &amp; shopping &amp; the subway for a quick ride downtown.  Quiet.  Comfortable.  Full kitchenette in room.  Nothing better to have a stocked fridge after a long summer day.  Very personable staff.
Inn at St. Botolph,Agnes,United States of America,1 review,June 20  2016,8.8,The sponge smelled bad (I boil mine in water plus tide every 1-2 weeks to sterilize it); the steps outside that require lifting up heavy luggage (consider having a ramp). the shower is very small.,Great location. easy to access with the code. affordable.

Inn at St. Botolph,Sander,Netherlands,8 Reviews,May 31  2016,7.1,Breakfast is really a complete embarrassment. Never seen this poor level before against these room rates. I suggest that the Hotel will be clear about this as a few snacks will not cover the 'breakfast' idea. Cleaning policy is a bit different. You have to post when you would like to have your room cleaned. this system failed twice and after several reminders they came into action. So they should manage expectations better.,Location is great. quiet area next to the metro station. Friendly staff and easy to acces by code. Nice rooms and the kitchenette in the room is a plus.
Inn at St. Botolph,Rabbit,United States of America,3 Reviews,May 29  2016,10,I have no complaints or suggestions.  Just keep doing what you do.,I loved the way the rooms were designed and decorated and the bed was very comfy. It was like a small apartment and the kitchen was well stocked with anything you would need. The breakfast had excellent choices (really liked the oatmeal.) The location was in a beautiful neighborhood and convenient to many things.  I'm glad there was an elevator.
Inn at St. Botolph,John,United Kingdom,9 Reviews,April 29  2016,8.8,The dÃ©cor was a bit dated and tired round the edges which gave the impression that the room was not as clean as it was.  Some impractical features like the tall table lamps with trailing. trip hazard wires in front of the window and the large bathroom mirror that was just resting on hook supports and could easily be dislodged.,This was like an apartment in the city with plenty of cupboard and drawer space. cooking facilities. coffee machine and refrigerator.  The continental breakfast in the small lounge was more than adequate for us and the girls in the adjacent office were always on hand if we had questions or needed anything for the room.  The location in a relatively quiet residential area was ideal for walking to the main areas of the city and. for longer journeys. the Prudential subway station was just a couple of minutes away.
Inn at St. Botolph,David,Ireland,3 Reviews,April 17  2016,9.6,If you used the cooking facilities there wasn't really anywhere to eat. just a tiny table or the writing desk. No problems since we ate out mostly but messy for breakfast.,Home from home. Very comfortable and spacious apartment with nearly everything you could need to have a perfect trip. The location is excellent. yards from shops. transport and restaurants. There was no noise at all to disturb our sleep in an amazing comfortable bed. Comfortable couch and chair to sprawl in after a hard days sightseeing and shopping while watching the large flat screen TV.
Inn at St. Botolph,John,United States of America,1 review,March 9  2016,9.6,N/A,Your room actually matches the website pictures. Excellent facility overall. Plan to stay there every time I travel to Boston. Almost don't want to give it a good review as it will become too popular and will always be booked. ğŸ˜„
Inn at St. Botolph,Elke,Germany,22 Reviews,March 1  2016,8.8,Needs some upgrades: carpet is worn and stained. mildew in the shower. etc.,Located in Boston's most charming neighborhood. cozy rooms. good coffee and breakfast food. very comfortable bed. the windows open!!!
Inn at St. Botolph,Marybeth,United States of America,2 Reviews,February 28  2016,9.6,I have had a number of stays in different suites and they were all two thumbs up. This was my first time in suite 204. and there was a creaking in the floor above me that would wake me up and keep me up.  I'm coming again in a few weeks. and again the month after that.  Kindly put on my record to avoid that suite if at all possible.  I still love the Inn at St. Botolph!That you very much,Terrific and helpful staff.  Beautiful linens.  Great kitchen set-up. ultra current decorating.  Extremely comfortable bed. and I love the minimalist concept of self check-in.
Inn at St. Botolph,John,Switzerland,1 review,February 17  2016,8.3,Noise insulation in the room is a bit poor.Room is -by default- not made every day. If you want the room service you need to ask for it.Breakfast is rich but it is way too concentrated on processed stuff (grain bars. yogurts. bagels. ..) and does not include any fresh food (e.g. fruit. fresh juice. eggs...),Staff is really super kind and helpful.Location is awesome. Close to the metro. services. restaurants. mall. etc.Room is equipped with kitchen. Very useful.Room bright. spacious. and very nicely decorated.

Thank you again. we never would have made the Patriots game if it weren't  for you. Next time we come to Boston we'll  definitely be staying there again.
Inn at St. Botolph,Javier,Spain,8 Reviews,December 15  2015,9.6,N/A,Great location. near Copley Square. If you travel by train it's a 10min walk to/from the Amtrak station. Huge room. very clean. Lots of restaurants and shops nearby. The room's huge and very clean. Good wifi. The door works with a code instead of a key. which can be a problem if you're forgetfull but if you're not. it's great

Inn at St. Botolph,Nina,Germany,8 Reviews,December 6  2015,9.6,It takes a moment to memorize the access code ;-),Very attentive and helpful staff. There were some hiccups concerning my booking. everything was resolved quickly and in the most professional manner.  Rooms are spacious and clean. and the building is so much more interesting than a large chain hotel. Nice neighborhood. If you don't need a giant breakfast buffet. but just like to grab a quick bite before you head out. it's just perfect. I hope to be back!
Inn at St. Botolph,Giselle,Argentina,9 Reviews,November 20  2015,10,-,I really loved the location and the hotel architecture&amp;design.

I would definitely go back to this place when going back to Boston.
Inn at St. Botolph,Americanist,United States of America,1 review,November 15  2015,9.6,I like that maid service. etc. is minimalist. but it would be nice to have a welcome packet in the room with details about how to use the security system panel (baffling). the fact that there was free coffee/breakfast downstairs (didn't know till I checked out). Ahard to get room completely dark. room partition pocket door broken. not the most comfortable bed. Still much better than a chain hotel.,Excellent location. quiet street. Kimpton-flavor decor. very amply sized room. Kitchenette was nice feature. with a convenience store across the street.
Inn at St. Botolph,Tom,United States of America,2 Reviews,November 10  2015,8.3,N/A,Small suite nice change from regular hotel.  Location to convention center was terrific.  Quiet overall (except for the rabbel rousers going by after the bars closed each night).

The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Michael,France,28 Reviews,October 31  2017,7.9,N/A,Very nice room &amp; super comfortable bed; I do not think the "trendy/innovative" idea works in practice when you are the paying customer - beautifully etched bathroom walls give no privacy which I prefer. Can only speak as we find - we were there on a Friday night mid October 2017- work on adjacent construction sites woke us at 5.00am &amp; vehicles reversing in to the popular lobster bar opposite the Hotel also started arriving early. Regretfully a disappointing &amp; noisy location in our experience
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Roman,United States of America,11 Reviews,October 23  2017,8.8,Price. We stayed in October and prices were just crazy in all the hotels in Boston.Also. just a small weird noise from the outlet near the bed - needs to be fixed.,One of the best hotels I have visited.Amazing city and river view from the room. A lot of space inside.High End interior design. nice terrace with great panoramic views of the city at night.Would definitely visit this hotel again in the future.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Garrie,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,October 19  2017,8.3,Both bars shut at 10.45pm,The location is very handy for site seeing and general walking about.Quirky room with great views. however lower rooms look right into the seafood restaurant across the way. Food was good and so was the GnTs !
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Trish,New Zealand,4 Reviews,October 17  2017,9.6,Our room was next to the bridge so a bit noisey a lot of the time but sometimes the price you pay for being right in town,Proximity to most areas we wanted to look around. Close to the cruise terminal as we were off on a cruise next day. Bonus was that we were close to the No Name Cafe which was a great casual place to eat. Very modern hotel and staff were all very helpful. Lovely bar on the roof with fabulous views all around the city.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Kirsten,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 3  2017,10,Parking was very limited: valet for $50 a day or park in the garage across the street for $40 a day.,One of the most beautiful hotels I've ever stayed in. Amazing views of the Boston skyline. Amazing restaurants close by. The hotel's restaurant and rooftop bar were very cool. I would come back in a heartbeat.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Anonymous,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,September 29  2017,6.7,Very noisy location. Service not great - would expect more for the price of the hotel room.,Great view of city from roof top bar.Comfy bed. Good shower. Hotel very modern and looks amazing.Food in the restaurant was excellent.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Hannah,United States of America,5 Reviews,September 24  2017,9.2,Could have used a larger trash can in our room and a mini fridge even for just the one night we were there. but otherwise - everything was lovely! The staff was very accommodating and quick to deliver anything we needed!,The restaurant has AMAZING food! Flavorful. creative. and delicious! The artwork in the hotel is awesome! Perfect for photo shoots with friends.. Rooftop bar overlooking the harbor and delicious cocktails - winning combination!
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Dstuhne,Switzerland,55 Reviews,September 24  2017,9.6,Coffee machine in the room would be nice. But this is not a big issue. coffee is great in the restaurant!,Amazing hotel. great location and extremely clean! Loved the view from my room. great food in the restaurant.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Adrian,Malta,13 Reviews,September 17  2017,8.8,The mattress of the queen size bed was not comfortable. It seemed to be worn out and needs replacement.,The location is excellent since it is a few metres from the promenade and within walking distance from most attractions.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Mackenzie,Canada,1 review,August 25  2017,10,Wish there could have been room service after 11:00pm! And I wish I could have stayed longer.,Beautiful room. great service. such a great view from the Look Out bar!
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Jennifer,United States of America,1 review,August 25  2017,9.6,Wasn't expecting a 100 dollar deposit on each of the rooms that I booked which was held for several  days after my stay.  also there is no ice machine on any of the floors,The room was very nice and clean . the staff was so sweet nice and  accommodating . the roof top bar was amazing the view is excellent and the restaurant was delicious
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Jennifer,United States of America,4 Reviews,August 24  2017,4.2,When I booked the room I noted late check in. When we got to the hotel and tried to valet the car. it was Friday night with a line down the block for the rooftop bar and neither of the guys could be bothered to talk to us so we paid to park in a nearby lot. not a great start. Then we get through the herd. check in and go up to find the room not what I'd paid more for--partial sea view. They'd switched us to a different room directly over the footpath so we heard people walking by drunk all night since we weren't on a high floor. I asked when we checked out about this and the same guy who checked us in stammered that since I'd booked through a third-party service (though I'd paid a higher rate for this room type) we'd been moved to a different room though not told. also because we checked in late. though he said "not that that matters.' to which I reminded him that was noted in the booking. And the cleaning woman came by and tried to come in to clean at 9 AM though check out wasn't for hours. which he apologized for. The next two nights we were in Portland. Maine staying at another Marriott Autograph hotel and the experience was night and day.  I wouldn't recommend this hotel. Worst of our trip.,Our room was well-sized and the Fresh toiletries were the best part of our stay.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,D-man,Canada,1 review,August 22  2017,9.6,The bathroom design in the rooms with (2) Queen beds should have more privacy.  You should antipate the people staying in this configuration of room are not a couple.,The rooftop bar and hotel amenities were great
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Christine,United States of America,7 Reviews,July 26  2017,10,N/A,Location was perfect for waking and enjoying the city. Room and view were one of the best we've ever had at a hotel and we do a bit of traveling. Can't wait to return.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Lin,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 11  2017,9.6,The bathroom wall separating the bedroom and the bathroom should be opaqued to 3/4 heights. so the guests would have more privacy. especially when they travel with their children.,The hotel is right on Boston Harbor with a fantastic water view. and is within 15-20 minutes walking distance to all tourist attractions. Downtown Boston. Chinatown. North Point/Little Italy. etc.. SL subway line to Airport is short 4minutes walk.  One of the big  pluses is that hotel guests have a direct access to its popular and wonderful roof-top bar without having to wait in the long queue in the lobby with the walk-in customers.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Kellyla217,United States of America,21 Reviews,July 5  2017,10,Slow valet pickup. only 2 elevators (one of which is dedicated for the rooftop/bar access for outside guests). no refrigerator in the room,Convenient location. beautiful views of the harbor. helpful and friendly staff. awesome rain shower

The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Anna,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 21  2017,10,Food was a bit pricey. so I elected to eat elsewhere.,Very modern and centrally located. Staff was incredibly friendly and was able to hold my luggage while I worked for the day. Would stay here again.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Margaret,United States of America,1 review,May 29  2017,8.3,Bathroom divider is see through - while actual shower has a modestypanel covering the clear glass - you can look right into the bathroomif someone is changing or coming out of the shower - not good witholder children,Location was excellent. front desk staff very helpful
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Chris,United States of America,1 review,April 20  2017,10,There was no refrigerator in the room...we didn't ask for one. so I don't know if it's an option...it wasn't important enough for us to call down to the front-desk and ask.  Given the "high-tech" nature of the hotel. I expected the WiFi to be better. signal was always poor. we were on the 5th floor (I just used my own MiFi instead). and would have expected a dedicated Ethernet port for my laptop.,They had plenty of available electrical sockets. and dedicated USB ports.I was nice to be able to use my Netflix account via the TV (though a keyboard would have been nice for entering the password).The staff were always accommodating and had no problem with house keeping making a late afternoon stop by our room as I'd been in all day.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,JakeLewis,United States of America,16 Reviews,April 9  2017,9.6,The shower portion of the bathroom has a clearish wall that does not give very much privacy. I was traveling with my sister. so not exactly comfortable for either of us. No fridges was a little bit of a nuisance for our visit. due to the length of time.,I loved this hotel! The staff were very friendly and definitely went out of their way to help and make our stay an enjoyable one. The decor of the hotel is beautiful! The view from the rooftop bar is amazing! Good location. with restaurants within walking distance. I slept like a baby! Nice gym too! If you are concerned about security. this hotel has you covered because everything except the main common areas on the first floor are protected through key card. Valet parking was great. the put your car in a facility not too far away from the hotel (I tracked my car to see where it went). I would stay at this hotel again when visiting Boston.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Alex,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,April 6  2017,9.6,Nice bathroom although it doesn't have a proper door so don't stay here unless you're very comfortable with your roomie!,Comfiest bed. cool furniture
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,March 21  2017,6.3,I'm not pleased that after arriving late in Boston. I had to walk to a new hotel because something in this hotel's system was messed up.  Not sure if it was Booking or the Envoy that had the issue. but it resulted in me having to move hotels at 10:00 pm.,The man at the front desk was nice! He helped me out when Booking messed up my reservation and he booked a room for me at a new hotel.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Kathlyn,United States of America,1 review,March 21  2017,9.6,The WiFi would not let me sign in...The room was missing the TV remote. it took a staff member over an hour to bring another to the room..,I loved the shower!
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Mark,United States of America,1 review,March 14  2017,5.8,Ordered 2 coffees . Did not go out due to the cold weather. 2 coffees$15.99. what royal ripoff. Way over priced on everything. Waitress saidit was because we were at the Envoy. I guess that gives this hotel theright to over charge because of the name. I stayed in room 222. Afterthe royal screwing. it really turned me off on this hotel. Did not feellike a welcomed guess. Rather I felt it was to be a privilege to stay atthe Envoy. Not!,Room 222 was small for the value. No bathroom privacy. 2 night stay wasvery very over priced . Don't care if it was the "Envoy".
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Robert,United States of America,1 review,January 19  2017,9.6,The parking is insanely expensive.  25% of the room cost in my case.,This is a very nice property.  For a top tear frequent traveler. it was nice to stay someplace a little different that was obviously top-tier.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Brandon,United States of America,8 Reviews,December 30  2016,9.2,We waited a really long time (20 min. some couples waited longer) at checkout for our car at the valet. It seems like they park the cars offsite so have to go far to get them.,The decor of the hotel is awesome. The views from our room were really cool. Bar/ bartender were really good.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,John,United States of America,1 review,December 20  2016,10,No garage onsite to park car. Have to valet it and it's $$$.46.00 per day. If you pay a lot for the hotel room the parking should be half of this or not.,Location. how modern and clean this hotel is.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,BB1988,United States of America,9 Reviews,December 19  2016,8.8,A small bottle of sprite (3 bucks).  I get it. Boston is pricey but when I am already spending 800s for two nights...cut me a little slack on the sundries.,Great view.  Restaurants and shopping close by.  Staff was wonderful. Rooms clean. comfortable and very updated.  Location is within a couple blocks of subway.  Ubers always at the ready (pick-up location on side of building)
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Keith,United States of America,1 review,December 12  2016,5.4,Construction going on had a light long flight and wanted to relax but unfortunately construction started at 7:30 across the street from the hotel the view was terrible as I could see was contractors working I would've preferred a water view which I knew they had available but did not offer to me,The friendliness of the workers .The upscale style was nice
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Anthony,United States of America,2 Reviews,December 6  2016,10,Parking is pretty far away so if you don't call ahead of time to get your car you may have to wait 15 or more minutes.The alley between the hotel and the Barking Crab could use a good pressure wash. The grease from both restaurants covering the pavement looks and smells awful.,The staff are really nice. Common areas and rooms are very clean and well kept. I was surprised at the prices on the breakfast menu. I didn't find them to be higher than other local eateries. Most hotels I have been to have outrageous prices on their on sight restaurants. Our breakfast was really good.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Tobias,Netherlands,1 review,November 14  2016,5.8,The price-quality. I would have expected a lot more for the amount of money I payed to stay here.

The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Richard,United States of America,4 Reviews,November 9  2016,9.2,No in room coffee/tea and lobby coffee/tea only until 11.

The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Donald,United States of America,17 Reviews,September 25  2016,7.9,The quality of the restaurant food did not match the price. Ordered ice for the room.

The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Visitor,Germany,12 Reviews,September 20  2016,6.3,* Don't touch the fancy water box in the room - it's not free - you will have to pay $12 for water which tastes like cardboard.* The water-view room is not sea view. but some small river with an ugly bridge under construction view (see picture)* Absolutely not friendly stuff at the restaurant* Breakfast is not really included - you have to choose something from the menu worth $18 in total (including coffee). It's not that easy considering their overpriced dishes.* AC was incredibly loud! We thought it was some road work outside. but no* Floors in the room are really cold* Shower is stupid to use. you have to wait until water becomes warm (if you manage to turn it on)* Be careful to not touch the bathrobe hanging in the bathroom - it costs $90!* No European adapters (they promised to send us some. but they didn't appear during our 6 days stay).,Very clean. nice city view from the "water-view" room. pretty nice design
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Tina,United States of America,1 review,August 29  2016,9.6,Room was super modern. but slightly small (king bed w/ partial water view). Fine for one person. but if I was traveling with a partner could maybe feel a bit too on top of each other.,Roofdeck bar; as a guest you can cut the giant line that is a daily occurrence and go straight up with a flash of your room card. It was almost comical how many outlets and USB connections there were in the room. Not a bad thing. I simply only need 3 outlets at the most.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Alexandre,United Arab Emirates,2 Reviews,August 21  2016,6.7,Staff a little arrogant. half of them friendly. half of them not at all... We wanted to chamge the room. were not explained the difference with the new one they proposed. even when asked... Very rude/dismissive behavior. Even got given wrong info about where to buy bus tickets. Some staff quite friendly though.,Great location. nice looking boutique hotel. Excellent food.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Ally,Israel,1 review,August 20  2016,9.2,A bit noisy at night - you can hear music coming from the rooftop bar when you're in your room. Also. the hotel doesn't offer any complementary water or refreshments,Great location. large &amp; comfortable rooms. The hotel is new and the facilities are clean and very well maintained. Really enjoyed my time there

The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Sarah,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 26  2016,9.2,It has a very trendy rooftop bar that is very difficult to get into if you are not a guest. At times I felt like most of the staff only cared about the bar and not about the actualHotel guests. Whenever we came back from going out it would have been nice to have been greeted as a guest not assumed we were trying to get in line for the bar.,Very nice trendy hip property. It was a little pricey. but not too bad. rooms were spacious and cool. Location was perfect.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Svetlana,United Kingdom,9 Reviews,July 25  2016,2.9,hotel has a very popular roof top bar - since it's a small hotel. no matter where you stay. it is super noisy from about 7pm until the bar closing 2am. people are very loud since it attracts young crowd. Room cleaning is an issue. i stayed for 4 days and had an empty bottle of water that was there before i arrived and when i was leaving. i complained to the front desk to no avail. also had to call front desk when running out of toiletries. apparently replacing / adding them on a daily basis is not a norm for housekeeping.,i stay in this hotel because it's right next to my office so location is preferred. hotel is fancy and very new
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Alan,United Kingdom,29 Reviews,July 5  2016,9.2,In comparison with similar hotels elsewhere its pretty expensive. of course I knew that when I booked it. and OK I'd book it again.,Great location. very stylish and modern hotel.

The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,David,United States of America,1 review,June 28  2016,5.8,Got married night before called to tell them.so maybe they could do something special. wasn't expecting anything extravagant.They just said "heard you got married yesterday" when we checked in. Elevator was down and bouncer was rude when we asked where the stairs were....said he wasn't informed on that yet so we just stood there for five minutes. Room was nice and artsy. Just not worth 400 I would go with luxury hotel next time.,Nice view of the seaport. Clean.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Carl,Belgium,8 Reviews,June 9  2016,5.4,Noise coming from outside (restaurants in front ) and the bar on the roof .No fridge in the room .,Original design and beautiful sight on the City skyline
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Duncan,Canada,1 review,May 19  2016,7.9,Lack of coffee/tea facilities. room doesn't feel very homey. expensive room rate and food/drink. one of two elevators used mainly for bar guests. lineups of trendy people for the bar in the lobby. location is ok for business but in a newer area with not much life around and a lot of construction. It just doesn't feel a particularly welcoming place overall. but you sleep well.,Room is modern and clean. but spare. Bed is good. Free wifi. Gym is not big. but good quality.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,John,United Kingdom,10 Reviews,May 12  2016,7.1,Overpriced for actual substance. Bathroom all glass . no privacy . Very noisy late evening (esp weekend) - may be as we were on 2nd floor. Trendy but a bit pretentious for what it actually was,General appearance smart and modern . Some nice ideas . USB port next to beds . Large comfortable beds . Coffee table at reception in morning. Bright airy
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,J,United States of America,1 review,April 26  2016,5.0,AC was broken when we arrived. as well sheets on the bed were still stained from previous guest. Terribly overpriced for not much substance,Location and lobby were nice. shower head was nice
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Marianne,United States of America,1 review,April 24  2016,9.6,No refrigerator in room.,The breakfeast was delicious.Staff excellent. especially the bar staff and if you can get the toasted marshmallow desert. Outrageous.  Worth the calories!
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Laa,United States of America,7 Reviews,April 16  2016,10,N/A,The VIEW! It was a rainy weekend for us. but it was still beautiful. The Hotel was very clean and the staff was wonderful! I definitely recommend this location and will go back in the future!
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Mark,United Kingdom,79 Reviews,March 18  2016,10,Nothing,Sarah on reception was very professional and knowledgeable AND she supports the same soccer team as me. The room was great with the TV part of a bicycle frame. The bar and restaurant was very modern and arty. Right by the water with great places to eat in walking distance. Highly recommended!
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Steven,United States of America,1 review,February 23  2016,6.3,We had NO HOT WATER the morning of our departure.Due to no fault of yours there was a great deal of construction going on all around the hotel.,Location was convenient for our travel.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Jennifer,United States of America,1 review,February 16  2016,9.6,a few things I did not like.  There is no coffee pot in the room.  Second. breakfast is not included in your stay. no continental.   We did enjoy breakfast in the resteraunt downstairs. it was pricey but I had the BELTA breakfast sandwich. it was outstanding!!! Lastly. my husband and I sat in the lounge the evening before.  We had one round.  There were three bartenders on. it was not busy just steady and it seemed to be at a slower pace.  More attentive bar staff would have been a plus.  All in all. we will come back on our next adventure to Boston!  We were very pleased!!,We stayed at the Envoy Valentines night. Upon arrival. the valet staff was excellent. prompt. and courteous. along with the check in staff.  We reserved a king room with partial view.  To our surprise we had an amazing view of the harbor.  We enjoyed sitting and watching a few charter ships come in.  If it wasn't for the sub zero temperatures. we would have enjoyed a longer walk on the fen river adjacent to the hotel.  The envoy is in a perfect location!  The room was comfortable. quiet. you couldn't hear much noise outside the room in the hallway or outdoors. The bed was extremely comfortable.  We enjoyed our weekend away and would definitely stay at the Envoy again during warmer weather....we peeked at the rooftop bar which for the winter is closed.  It will be an amazing hotspot during warm weather!!  View is spectacular. I particularly enjoyed the robe and slippers provided for guests!!  Give this hotel two thumbs up.
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Anonymous,Taiwan,15 Reviews,December 24  2015,9.2,A lot of construction around the hotel. the bar close at 11pm which is a bit early,It's a new hotel. the staffs are super helpful. the restaurant is good. the room design is lovely
The Envoy Hotel, Autograph Collection,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,November 17  2015,9.6,Maybe just a more comfy headboard. It was a little awkward when I just wanted to watch TV and there wasn't really support.,Great set-up and normally I don't like the modern feel. It was fantastic. Loved that I had access to my Netflix account.

Global Luxury Suites at West End,Viviana,Ecuador,5 Reviews,September 10  2017,5.8,I was really disappointed because I was looking for a place with a pool and that"s how it was booked and advertised.  When I got there they told me that it didn't have a pool and that if I wanted to use the pool in the next building I had to pay $400 dollars. This was never specified when I booked. I found that really bad and dishonest.,The space.
Global Luxury Suites at West End,Fernanda,Brazil,13 Reviews,May 24  2017,7.9,We asked for an extra key becouse we wore in four. and they didn´t give it to us.We asked to someone fix the light of one of the bathroons and they didn't. We stayed all days without light on it.We asked for a late chekout becouse our flight would be at night and we have a child. and the charge for it is to hight (one day charge if you stay after 3 PM.),The location is very good. near subway station. Common Boston. many stores and touristics points.The flat is really good. comfortable and clean.We arrived earlier. before the check in time. and they gave us the key without extra charge.

One-Bedroom on D Street Apt 432,Salim,Lebanon,3 Reviews,October 17  2017,10,blinds can be improved. i like total darkness when i sleep. i also hated the automatic light in the bathroom coming on when u move. Very long walk from Entrance Lobby to the room,Discrete and welcoming
One-Bedroom on D Street Apt 432,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 25  2017,8.3,The bed didn't have a mattress pad or fitted sheet which seems a little unsanitary to me.,The apartment was just what I needed as I was between leases. The kitchen had everything I needed to make meals. the in unit washer and dryer were great. The gym was a plus too.This is not a full service hotel and doesn't have a host like Airbnb but I didn't need that so it was a great fit for me!
One-Bedroom on D Street Apt 432,Raymond,Ireland,1 review,September 23  2017,10,N/A,Building and location were fantastic. staff in the complex were very helpful.The apartment was very clean and had all facilities needed.
Boston Newbury,Anonymous,Ireland,2 Reviews,October 25  2017,7.9,Window with air con created a draft in the room . Bathroom had many unfinished areas like holes etc. Needs a paint and finishing off .  Lightning in main room very dull . Main door to room you can see the light from outside from landing area . Noise from fridge was very disruptive. Room was just scruffy but not dirty!,Convenient and central
Boston Newbury,Anonymous,New Zealand,1 review,October 11  2017,6.3,Phone didn't work properly. Only a single chair provided when advertised as having a sofa. Poorly equipped kitchen with no plug for the sink.,Nice apartment in a good location. Good access to T and easy walking to a number of interests.
Boston Newbury,Jessie,United States of America,9 Reviews,September 5  2017,6.7,Carrying heavy suitcases up narrow staircase wasn't fun but I knew that before I got there and if the suitcase hadn't been so heavy it wouldn't have been an issue!The blinds need to be replaced..  they don't fit the windows and they don't keep out sunlight nor street lights at night .,Proximity to everything. Bed was clean and comfortable. Good towels. shampoo etc. water pressure was great and the water was hot. which Iiked. Kitchen was great ..everything you needed if you wanted to cook! I didn't.
Boston Newbury,William,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 7  2017,6.7,2 locals 20 somethings .smoking at the entrance. The cabie could not the front door. the front door need more visable #'s. The building wasn't marked well. The carpet to third floor smelled and needed cleaning. The bed frame was broken. Pink mold growing in shower door frame.,Location for my travel. Key code access. the extra linens. perfect.
Boston Newbury,Craig,Egypt,11 Reviews,July 24  2017,5.0,Ok. Where to start?Bathroom was dirty. Kitchen needs a proper clean. 4 coathangers. Cupboard door doesn't shut properly. The door to the hallway has gaps and therefore you can hear all conversations and also the light shines through constantly. The biggest issue was the fact that the bed was dreadful - however they were going to replace it on the day that I left. Shame.,The distance to Fenway
Boston Newbury,Christine,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 7  2017,10,I would not describe it as recently renovated.  All three windows could not open. Only one chair for sitting.  Not easy to sit on high backless stools.,The location could not have been better. Close to the subway; they stored our bags on arrival and gave us early check in after a red eye flight from California.  We had the studio and it was not claustrophobic.  Bed was fine for sleeping but has been used for sitting on for a few years.  Requests for assistance were attended to. It's an old building but at least one window opened during the summer heat. Air conditioning worked and the overhead fan helped.  We went for the Fourth of July celebration and were within easy walking distance of the Charles River esplanade for the concert and fireworks.  Note: for food preparation there are no supplies other than dishes.  Trader Joe's nearby and a deli had all we needed: fresh food. condiments. beer and wine.  We always travel with sandwich bags so were set to take lunch on the road. The busses for tours picked us up at a nearby hotel.  As for the view. we were on the second floor.  Room had high ceilings and a bay window with trees in front.  The blinds may have been installed the last time the mattress was purchased.  They did not all work well which mattered in the heat. TV and wi if worked fine.  Good water pressure and heat. plus hairdryer in the bathroom.  Plenty of clean towels and linen replacement if you needed.  We did not request  daily housekeeping.  They did provide plenty of toiletries if you needed that. Great old mansion within view of the room.  Really quiet for how near to a very busy area.  Shout out for the Capital Grille and Three Wise Donkeys. a custom t shirt shop which made a shirt with my dog's photo on it.
Boston Newbury,Graeme,Australia,2 Reviews,July 5  2017,5.8,Room was located on 2nd floor.Very narrow  srairwell made it difficult to bring luggage up to room.Upon arrival the room was yet to be made up when we were told earlier it was all set up for us.,Close proximity to the vity
Boston Newbury,Victoria,United States of America,1 review,June 27  2017,10,Nothing,We loved the location and the unit was small. but perfect for two people. It was nice having a small fully stocked kitchen so we could make some of our own food. We were close to everything we wanted to do and we enjoyed all the parks near us. The city was beautiful and busy with interesting people and so much to do!
Boston Newbury,C,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,June 22  2017,5.0,It was a complete disappointment. Clearly they have one nice apartment they use for all the photos and the rest don't matter. It needed a real good clean. dust under the bed. dead bugs on the window sill. marks all over the floor and chunk of plaster missing from one wall! Only clean room was the bathroom! Such a shame cos we were really looking forward to this place as all the other stops in our trip were hotels and we wanted to try something different. maybe we will just stick to hotels in future...,Location was lovely. Boston is a very chilled city and the apartment is close to a lot of beautiful parks.
Boston Newbury,David,Australia,4 Reviews,June 11  2017,6.7,The bed was broken . the chair was broken and the pillows were terrible . we out and bought new pillows good luck for the next guest . they replaced the chair .I dropped my phone and when I looked under the bed it was very dirty!I don't want to bag the place as it was in a great position just needs a good clean !,Excellent position !
Boston Newbury,Anonymous,Cayman Islands,1 review,May 1  2017,8.8,The mattress is not comfortable and incredibly loud as you sit down on it or roll at all.  Window dressings need updating so that you can control the lighting since they are wooden fixed louver shutters. you have no control on how bright it gets through the morning.  Narrow staircase for walking up 3 flights with luggage.,Excellent neighborhood with charm and class.  Well appointed kitchen with everything you need including a kettle.  Lovely architecture and great large windows to open up the space.  Simple to use electronic locks.  Amazing water pressure.
Boston Newbury,Richard,United States of America,1 review,April 10  2017,7.9,Several light bulbs were out. one window's blinds didn't shutThere should be an option under 'staff' for 'n/a'.  I didn't see anyone during my stay. but didn't really need to as it was keyless entry and I was able to get right in to my unit.,Location. cost. quietness. keyless entry so check-in was instantaneous
Boston Newbury,Ian,Portugal,23 Reviews,April 8  2017,4.6,The property from the street looks somewhat run down and on entering we had to climb some difficult stairs which clearly had not been cleaned for some time to reach our 'suite'. To be fair the room was clean. if a little shabby. The kitchen was well equipped but very small. The extract fan sounded like a jet engine and the two stools were so low you could not eat at the breakfast bar. Nowhere to hang clothes or store bags. The air-con unit was a punched through the window type that was badly fitted and let in a blast of cold air. The small bathroom was just adequate with quite good towels and plenty of hot water. The bed sagged and the springs in the mattress made so much noise we did not sleep well. Photo of swearing allegance to America in Boston Senate House.,There was not a lot to like really.
Boston Newbury,Thomas,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,March 27  2017,6.7,Could have been a lot cleaner. Very dusty in areas and bedding was quite old and worn looking.,Location was great. room size and using pin codes instead of keys was good.

Boston Newbury,Marc,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,January 19  2017,10,Not a big deal but the wifi didnt work. and when it did was very slow. Wouldnt stop me from going back though.,Location. cleanliness and facilities were excellent.
Boston Newbury,Hilary,United Kingdom,19 Reviews,January 13  2017,6.9,I guess I should have complained but here are my negatives: 1. There was no central light switch and most lights were not working. I therefor had lights from one small bedside lamp. the bathroom and the microwave which is not great. 2 one of the bathroom towels had fresh glitter eye shadow so was not newly washed. 3. The small bottle of shampoo was half used and there was no soap.4. There was no coffee for the coffe maker5 the mug in the cupboard was badly chipped.6. The first night was cold weather and the room was very cold. Later during the week it was warmer and the room was too hot but there was no way to adjust the heating.,The location is great and the access using the provided codes was very easy. I was pleased to be on the 2nd floor as carrying suitcases up the narrow stairs would have been difficult in this historic building
Boston Newbury,Stuart,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,January 11  2017,10,curtains or good blinds on the windows i was in appartment 3.and had weird wooden pannel blinds that looked they came straight out of the 80s,brilliant location in a fantastic part of boston.well furnished.and easy to find with great access to theT
Boston Newbury,Ricardo,Portugal,21 Reviews,January 5  2017,8.3,N/A,We don't have to hurry about the keys. because they gave me a code to enter in home; so it was very comfortable. The neighborhood is beautiful but very expensive.
Boston Newbury,Grant,Australia,3 Reviews,December 11  2016,8.3,3pm check in is too late (staff were good enough to let us in at 2pm though),Location. character of the building and room. bed. kitchen was basic but good enough. whilst very close to everything. it was very quiet
Boston Newbury,Mr,United States of America,1 review,December 6  2016,9.2,Not ideal for someone with a heavy suitcase. When I travel for work I pack a lot of food. The steps leading up to the front door have no landing where you can put down your luggage while opening the front door. After I managed to get through the front door. I had to carry my suitcase up two steep and winding flights of stairs. Much better for someone who is travelling light.,Very clean and comfortable room. Loved having a real kitchen. Proximity to Hynes Convention Center was very convenient.
Boston Newbury,Aaron,Australia,3 Reviews,November 17  2016,8.8,Only very minor issues.,Location is amazing. very quiet despite being just off Newbury street.  Great apartment. easy to deal with and the staff member at the sister property where we left our luggage was very friendly.  She even offered us fresh cold bottles of water which was a very nice touch!
Boston Newbury,Jennifer,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,November 8  2016,5.4,No information what so ever. 36steps I was told only a few steps. Windows rotten an no fire escape. Entrance hall not clean an a dirty rug.  plenty of place for a nice shelf with info of area an how to get about even advice on rail bus or taxi number would have been helpful,Location. Bed was good
Boston Newbury,Deb,Australia,6 Reviews,October 17  2016,4.0,Was not clean. especially the entrance.  Did not provide kitchen cleaning equipment.  Shutters were broken &amp; windows were filthy. frames needed painting.  Fridge was noisy.  Lights almost useless.  Switches had intermittent fault.,Location was fantastic. close to everything.
Boston Newbury,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 24  2016,6.7,Very small and not in great condition. The fridge was left defrosting by the staff when we arrived. the blow dryer was not working. only one roll of toilet paper was left even though no maid service is available during the stay. Very noisy location.,The most amazing location and clean inside.
Boston Newbury,Joanne,Australia,12 Reviews,September 18  2016,8.3,Unfortunately the wifi was not operational during our 3 day weekend stay. and the air conditioner was exceptionally noisy. so couldn't really be used except in short bursts.,Lovely room in top location. just around the corner from bustling Newbury St.
Boston Newbury,James,United Kingdom,50 Reviews,September 1  2016,5.5,the bed was uncomfortable and squeaked when you turned over making it impossible to sleep. the 'SOFA' was actually one single seater chair. the pillows were awful and the noise from the other guests was not nice. the traffic outside could be heard at all hours and the blinds were at least a foot too short and not wide enough,location
Boston Newbury,Jim,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 15  2016,5.4,Cleanliness was pretty sad especially the bathroom. While the tub and toilet were clean the walls and floor had many human hairs stuck to them. Quite disgusting.made us wonder how well the rest of the apt was really cleaned.,Location was perfect for our needs and the price was a good value compared to other hotels and rentals in that area.
Boston Newbury,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 12  2016,8.8,Would suggest a larger air conditioner and curtains. It was very hot during our stay and the sun shines right in.,Location was great. Place was nice.enough room for 2 people. Building was quiet. Nice neighborhood.  Great value! Would definitely stay again.
Boston Newbury,Blake,United States of America,1 review,August 9  2016,7.5,The room itself wasn't as nice as pictures suggested. but the location made up for this. After all. in a city as beautiful as Boston you shouldn't be spending much time in the room anyway besides to sleep and get ready.,The location was a prime spot in Boston. so many nice restaurants and shops on Newbury and Boylston Street. The public garden and Boston Common are a 15 minute walk down Newbury Street.
Boston Newbury,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 7  2016,9.2,The carpeting in the entry way and up the stairs was very stained. Terrible.  When I arrived and saw the carpet. I thought I had made a big mistake.  But there were no similar problems in the apartment itself. It's a great apartment. clean. comfortable and stylish. with high end stone finishes in the kitchen and bathroom.  One glitch: the confirmation email I received from booking.com included the outside entry code but not the apartment code.  Happily I noticed this omission and phoned during business hours. If you stay here. on receipt of the confirmation. be sure to call the telephone number provided to check the codes.,You could not stay in a better location in Boston. The apt at 48 Hereford St. (Studio apt. No. 3) is half a block from Newbury St.. with a multitude of restaurants. cafes and shops. T station and Trader Joe's are very near. Attractive and comfortable apartment. Vastly better than being confined to a hotel room. Would stay here again.
Boston Newbury,C,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,August 4  2016,9.6,No staff but to be fair it's serviced apartment and staff located at main office close by whom are very helpful,Neighbourhood was fantastic and great vibe from day to night. Close to subway station
Boston Newbury,Paul,United States of America,5 Reviews,July 6  2016,7.9,Typical hotel type pillows. Unit was a bit smaller than I thought. Air conditioner had a mind of its own.,15 minute walk to Fenway park. Three minute walk to Trader Joes. A great location in Back Bay.
Boston Newbury,Athnasios,Greece,14 Reviews,July 3  2016,7.5,We were initially given a room far from the pictures on the web (much smaller) &amp; not cleaned properly before our arrival. yet once we expressed our disappointment to the hotel. they took immediate action and transferred us a few hours later to a much better room that was up to our expectations. Also the building manager came to check right after if everything was meeting our expectations. so incredible action taken by the management team!! much appreciated.,location is super convenient
Boston Newbury,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 24  2016,8.8,The bed could use an upgrade in quality and the closet/bathroom weren't really above average. However. I'd stay here again given the overall value,Great location and the staff was very helpful. I appreciated the early check in.
Boston Newbury,Marie,United States of America,1 review,June 21  2016,9.2,small things: I think a booklet with information about the surrounding area would be helpful. maybe take-out menus and so forth. A lot of that is easy to get online. but a browsable version in the room would be good. The toaster and bathroom fan weren't working while I was there. but the management responded very promptly and offered to fix them during my stay. My advice to fellow travelers: check on those little things when you arrive and speak up. because the staff here really want you to be happy and will go the extra mile to ensure it.,Perfect location and set-up for a solo traveler. I felt secure/safe and was close to many amenities and sights. including a Trader Joe's and Walgreen's for last-minute essentials. also great restaurants and shops. Check-in and departure were super smooth. Staff was fantastic-- ask for help or advice. and they are more than happy to send a quick email or call in reply.
Boston Newbury,Anonymous,India,1 review,June 20  2016,7.1,The window has blinds and not curtains. That cost saving makes a good property look cheap. The blind was 4-6 inches short after repairs. Not a comforting thought when outsiders can see you inside !You will need to drag your luggage up as their is no elevator.,Good location
Boston Newbury,Cornelia,United States of America,1 review,May 18  2016,5.8,The room was dirty. dusty. and hair from previous guests was all over the bed. and quilts. and bathroom. The blankets were worn out and dirty. Found some melted chocolate on one of them. Furniture. fixtures etc all pretty run down. The room would need a total makeover to bring out its charm. Or at least a proper cleaning to start with.,Location.
Boston Newbury,Jodie,Australia,36 Reviews,May 14  2016,6.3,The bed was extremely uncomfortable and the blinds are broken preventing the street lights at night from being blocked out and also interferes with privacy as you cannot completely prevent people from the street seeing in.,The location just around the corner from Newbury street with its restaurants and shopping was perfect.
Boston Newbury,Laura,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 9  2016,9.2,Our upstairs neighbors had visitors...loud ones...until 4:30 am which made our 11:00 exit difficult.  The staff knocked on the door at 11:00 am and gave us a hard time-not a fault of the place and the downside of not being in a hotel where one can ask the management to intervene.  Yes. I could have gone up to ask the people to quiet down...but who wants to be "that" person.  All in all a good experience.,Small but had everything one needs.
Boston Newbury,Eva,Switzerland,9 Reviews,May 5  2016,5.0,The room was full of dust. Window blinds too short and white. After sun rise you cannot sleep anymore. The matrass was not comfortable. Very inefficient staff. at our arrival we found out that the room previously assigned to us was changed. but they forgot to tell us on time. during our staying they changed the door code without advising. Result I had to call up in the middle of the night to ask for the new one.,Good position in a lively area full of restaurants. bar etc. and the train station. Walking distance from one the most famous park in Boston and few other attractions.
Boston Newbury,Sam,United States of America,1 review,April 28  2016,8.8,Early check-in was approved for our morning arrival. but when we got to the unit it was still being used by another customer. Would have appreciated notice that our early check-in wasn't possible anymore due to another booking that had not checked out yet.,Although we ran into a snafu. customer service was eager to help when we let them know of our issue. Great. central neighborhood for new and seasoned visitors to Boston!
Boston Newbury,Aaron,United States of America,1 review,April 15  2016,8.8,The only thing we didn't like was the bed and pillows.  We had a queen.  I would have rather had a full and a better mattress and pillows!  Those two things were the only downfalls.,Loved the location and value for the money!  Walking distance to everything we were looking for.
Boston Newbury,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,March 20  2016,10,Nothing.  Everything was great.,Location. the unit itself. the price and the service.  Carlos was pleasant. quick and eager to respond and help me with getting the TV and Internet going.
Boston Newbury,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,March 10  2016,4.6,The floor was filthy. the window sills looked like they hadn't seen a cloth in years. The bed cover was covered in white flecks of something. the bathroom was minute and very dirty. The shower head needs a clean desperately. The cable box didn't work at all. There was so much road noise. and light coming on around the door from the hallway. We were honestly incredibly disappointed that we spent money to stay there.,The location was good.
Boston Newbury,Eileen,United States of America,11 Reviews,March 9  2016,6.3,bed was not very comfortable.the place is clearly a bit seedy but ok considering comparable prices,proximity to intended activities. kitchen. entry and exit ease ... no hotel lobby pass through. no pretentious staff. privacy
Boston Newbury,Paige,United States of America,1 review,February 9  2016,7.9,The space heater did not heat the room at all. so we had to sleep in our jackets. It was also very loud; we had a room viewing the street. and it sounded like we were directly outside.,The location was great. the room was clean. and it felt like a true Boston experience. I felt very safe the entire time and the staff even let us store our bags while we waited for our flight.
Boston Newbury,Anonymous,United States of America,4 Reviews,December 23  2015,7.1,I don't usually do reviews...butFirst impression walking into the lobby area. it reeked of pot. We figured whatever we are in the city. During the night a party on the first floor raged on that had people coming and going slamming the doors. like it was a drug dealers haven. The pot smell wavered up to our room as well. People were screaming with no regard that people may be trying to sleep from midnight to 5 am. It was ridiculous! The music shook our room. Because it was an apartment we felt other than calling police we had no other options. I would have preferred a hotel.,The location was great...the apartment was clean
Boston Newbury,nebokeneko,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,December 7  2015,7.1,- As there is no staff on-site. I've found there was a stranger sleeping on the bottom of the stair one morning...- They do change the code for the front door (which is good). but they should notify their guests because I had to call them (roaming charge) to ask for the new code.- Would feel more secure if they can have a safe in the room and CCTV by the entrance.- The toilet bin wasn't emptied on arrival. Pillow case and duvet looked a bit gross (i.e. hair that doesn't belong to me)- Free WiFi unstable/disconnect every few minutes or so on laptops. given that the WiFi signal was strong.,- Fully equipped kitchen. Spotlessly clean on arrival! (Hob. microwave. oven. fridge. bowls. pans. dishes. cutlery including can and bottle opener etc...) - The guide was useful. otherwise I didn't know there's a grocery shop in the basement on the main street!- Luggage storage is available off-site (10 min walk away)- Free WiFi works great on the phone. but not on laptops.
Boston Newbury,Jane,United States of America,1 review,November 16  2015,7.5,Large windows without storm sashes or insulated glazing so the street noise is very loud inside. Window shades are minimal so the street lights are dominant throughout the night. Mattress on bed is minimal. a thicker one would be more comfortable.,Great location. Very clean room.
Boston Newbury,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,November 6  2015,9.6,One of us has arthritis in her knees and it was hard to walk up and down 4 stories over and again. It would have been a nice touch to supply a salt and pepper shaker. It also would have been helpful if you had told us that the Logan Express bus goes to Hynes Convention Center just 2 blocks away.,It was nicely furnished. neat and clean and was attractively quaint. We liked its historical feel. the wood and exposed brick. The kitchen was just right. It was in an ideal location.

Hotel Commonwealth,Lu,United States of America,14 Reviews,November 2  2017,7.5,Rest room super small. Once I open the door. i cannot step into the bath tub - have to open the door. glide into the small space next to the toilet. close the door. and then able to step into the bath tub...,Just fyi. it is a very traditional hotel. Mostly elderly people as far as I can see. Whether you'll like it really depends on what your style is.
Hotel Commonwealth,Michael,United States of America,5 Reviews,October 29  2017,9.6,No coffee maker in the room (I later found out that one could have been delivered upon request).,Great design; rooms in very good condition.  Restaurant was outstanding.
Hotel Commonwealth,Anonymous,United States of America,4 Reviews,October 23  2017,9.2,No coffee maker in the room. No fan in the bathroom.,Location. location. location!  Our son is a student at Boston University. The hotel is a short walk from his dorm. The beds were extremely comfortable. The room was a nice size. Train station next door.
Hotel Commonwealth,Boston,United States of America,6 Reviews,October 21  2017,9.2,We like nice breakfasts. and while the breakfast at Evening Standard in the hotel was fine. by day 2 we were ready for a change but because of the hotel location there was no other nice alternative for breakfast close by. Also there is no in-room coffee maker or coffee and tea available in the lobby. Although the hotel has free wifi. the free version is only up to 1MB speed. while the higher speed is $19.99/day. The free version is fine for web browsing but was not adequate when we tried streaming a movie from Amazon or Netflix. We ended up using the personal hotspot on my iPhone to watch the movie...,The Junior suite was very spacious and comfortable and we were thrilled that the housekeeping made up the room very early each day while we were at breakfast. We liked that there were two good restaurants at the hotel. and a Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts within the block. There is an entrance to the Kenmore Green Line T station in the same block as the hotel. We had beautiful weather and walked to the Convention Center. Newbury Street shops and across the bridge to MIT in Cambridge.
Hotel Commonwealth,Darin Engelhardt,United States of America,1 review,October 10  2017,6.7,I have stayed at the Hotel Commonwealth numerous times. and every prior experience I would rate 10 in every category.  Not this time.  I confirmed a king bed room in the booking.com reservation.  Hotel provided two queens - they explained that although the booking.com reservation confirmed a king bed. since the reservation was not made through the hotel site they could not honor the king bed reservation.  Either the booking.com site did not explain this possibility. or I did not see it on the booking.com site. The room was also below the standard of quality I have experienced every other time at the hotel.  The gentleman at the desk was not particularly professional in his interactions with me. both with his explanation and his demeanor at check in.  I need to emphasize that every other time I have stayed at the hotel. I have thought the staff and the hotel were truly phenomenal.  I have also previously had only positive experiences with booking.com.  The savings on the room for this trip were not worth the tradeoff in bed and room quality.,N/A
Hotel Commonwealth,Erkut,Turkey,2 Reviews,October 8  2017,6.7,Everything was fine during our trip. They had a mistake about my account and they didn’t listen what I say. Altough I wanted to talk with account or finance manager they didn’t let me to talk with her. 6 hours later we had a chance to gertogether with finance person and we solved the problem in five minutes. But I spent more than 3 hours in lobby. Only during this period I didn’t kike the fornt desk employees attitude.,N/A
Hotel Commonwealth,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 30  2017,9.6,The price could have been lower but what other hotel can you see Fenway from your hotel room?!?!,The staff was very helpful.  The subway was right outside the hotel so that made public transportation very easy.  We were in walking distance to Fenway.
Hotel Commonwealth,Mary,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 27  2017,9.2,The veiw! Our room faced a wall and parking garage. Never had this kind of view at this hotel before. The website pictures are not representative of the actual views.,The Staff is very knowledgeable about the areas around Boston and the location is very walkable. The room was very comfortable and clean.
Hotel Commonwealth,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 26  2017,9.6,The bar.,Staff was great. Restaurants are independently operated - very good. The bar was a huge disappointment. It is also independently operated and it is small. The door person profiled potential patrons...she was selecting a specific kind of crowd. Hotel patrons had no benefit in getting in for the final evening nightcap.
Hotel Commonwealth,Nicole,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 24  2017,9.2,Bed was less comfy than the hotel I stayed at in Minneapolis last week for a conference.,Location can't be beat - most rooms look right at Fenway Park and one of the elevators is decorated like a giant baseball and the wall signed by former players.
Hotel Commonwealth,Ca,United States of America,1 review,September 21  2017,9.2,The restaurant wasn't good at all.  We attempted to have dinner once but. the menu wasn't accommodating and it was very loud.  We did go for breakfast and again the music was very loud.  I ordered the French toast and less than 5 minutes later it arrived. COLD!  The portions we small and it was overly priced for what I received.  The staff was nice but. the food. price. and loudness was not good.,Everything was really nice and the staff was friendly.  The décor really captured the Red Sox!  It was very clean and easy to navigate.
Hotel Commonwealth,Thomas,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 17  2017,10,N/A,We liked everything about the hotel.  We were going to see the Red Sox. so the location was excellent - just three blocks away.  The first impression of the hotel was the staff - who were all wonderful.  Very friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived to the door closed on the cab when we left.  The hotel lobby was a comfortable place to relax or wait for friends.The room was large. clean and comfortable.  The bathroom was clean and the shower was powerful and the hot water plentiful.There are two very good restaurants that are attached or accessible through the hotel and we would highly recommend both.In summary. stay here. you'll be happy with your choice.
Hotel Commonwealth,St,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 11  2017,9.2,It was expensive but close to what we wanted to see and very easy to get to public transportation.,The hotel was just steps away from the subway.  We took the Silver Line from the airport and realized that the trip from the airport to the hotel was actually FREE.  One day we walked from Boston Commons to the hotel.  It was long but a fun walk.  So close to Fenway that we went to the baseball game twice.  Desk clerk was friendly and nice.  Eastern Standard had a great breakfast.
Hotel Commonwealth,Richard,Ireland,2 Reviews,September 9  2017,10,There wasn't a coffee maker in the room.  You could get one. but you had to request it.  And also then request the coffee to be regularly stocked up.  For the quality of the hotel. it just seemed strange that such a basic feature was missing.  There is a dunkin donuts and Starbucks right next door. but there should still be a coffee maker in every room as a default.,Staff were friendly. the location was perfect for baseball as Fenway is just round the corner.  Kenmore subway station is right next door meaning you can get anywhere in the city very easily.  The hotel has a baseball theme running through it. so a great hotel for baseball fans.  Rooms were spacious and very clean. perfect really.
Hotel Commonwealth,Lisa,United States of America,7 Reviews,September 8  2017,8.8,Our experience unfortunately was marred by the front desk person's telling us that the check in time was not 3 PM but rather 4 PM; she claimed that the hotel's website had not yet been updated to reflect this. She then tried to put us in a room for more money if we wanted to check in at 3 PM. Finally. fortunately. she did  find a room for us at 3 PM and it was a little better than the one we had originally booked. But to go through that hassle in the beginning did not get our visit off to a good start. The parking fee per night seemed  inordinately high. Also. the hotel offered one bottle of water in the room and it was for $6.,The proximity to Fenway Park was this property's biggest asset. Also. the rooms were extremely well appointed and comfortable; creative in the baseball-stitched curtains. The amenities were also top notch.  Other than the experience with the front desk noted separately. the staff were all very friendly and helpful.
Hotel Commonwealth,Brianne,Canada,10 Reviews,September 6  2017,10,N/A,You can't go wrong staying here. The hotel is super clean and spacious. modern and fun. It also had extra comforts - extra towels without having to ask. toiletries like Qtips and cotton balls. big bathroom. etc. This was our favourite hotel of the trip. The location was perfect for us to catch a game at Fenway. and also to walk up to Beacon Hill. Boston Public Gardens. etc. There are tons of shops and restaurants nearby as well.

Hotel Commonwealth,Elaine,United States of America,1 review,August 6  2017,8.3,I had to ask for things such as an electric kettle or a coffee maker. Room did not have a hair dryer. but probably you had to ask for it. The rooms were really empty of the usual amenities. but they were supplied if you asked. The problem is that some of the people did not know they could just ask for what they needed.,Rooms were beautiful and clean. Staff was terrific!
Hotel Commonwealth,Kelli,United States of America,4 Reviews,August 5  2017,10,Having to unload our car at the curb/in the street and only having valet parking as a possibility.

Hotel Commonwealth,Eduardo,United States of America,1 review,July 27  2017,8.8,The day we left. noted various increased charges for the room rate. Apparently. they charge MORE based on the capacity of the hotel which was never communicated to us- so quite an unpleasant surprise! Also. no way for us to verify "capacity" of guests to know if this was true.Would have been nice to have a "hotel discount" from the adjacent restaurants as breakfast was not included with the room.,So nice that it was located next to the T. Thoughtful that they provided an umbrella as it rained when we were there. Very clean and modern. Two great restaurants connected to the hotel. Staff very friendly. Fresh ice water with fruits at the front desk.
Hotel Commonwealth,Wendy G,United States of America,4 Reviews,July 27  2017,6.7,For $400 plus a night. we expected perks like a coffee station in the room. bath robes. and little toiletries like a disposable shower cap. We ordered a pot of coffee for $25 and while it came quickly. it was honestly the WORST coffee we've ever tasted. Location was convenient but also had homeless people hanging out and even sleeping all night just across from the main entrance. The view of the stadium was dominated by an abandoned industrial sight and multi lane highway that was NOISY and not an upgrade as the Booking.com app made it seem.,We loved the modern updated bathroom!

Hotel Commonwealth,Linda,United States of America,1 review,July 26  2017,7.1,No coffee. Fire alarm went off Monday early AM requesting an evacuation. Then a five minute automated "all clear" alarm. Went to check out and none of the staff acknowledge the alarm. didn't offer an apology or anything. Very rude awakening on a Monday morning. A lot of people were upset and the staff just simply ignored the issue. No morning coffee or paper. which isn't a good sign of basic hospitality.,Stayed in new section of hotel. Was a great room with a great view. Clean and modern. AC worked wonders in the Boston heat and humidity.

Hotel Commonwealth,Candace,United States of America,13 Reviews,July 20  2017,8.3,For the first time I felt very challenged by the hotel entry way.

Hotel Commonwealth,Eastcoastour,United States of America,1 review,July 10  2017,10,N/A,My son and I were on a college tour.

We were very pleased with our accommodations.
Hotel Commonwealth,Laura,United States of America,1 review,July 10  2017,7.1,I didn't think the room was worth the price.  With taxes and valet fee. it was over $500.  For that price. I want perfection.  Bathroom tub floor was peeling. didn't seem that clean to me.  Beds were so/so. not super comfortable.  Towels in bathroom felt like sandpaper when drying off.,Property was perfectly located to where we were going (Fenway).  Staff was very helpful and very pleasant.  Room was clean and view of Fenway was cool.
Hotel Commonwealth,Jillian,United States of America,1 review,July 9  2017,10,N/A,Nick at the front desk took EXCELLENT care of my girlfriends and I. who were staying there for a birthday and bachelorette party. He went above and beyond to make sure our trip was memorable and fun. It's the little things that take a hotel from 'good' to 'amazing' and the staff here certainly has the service part down. Thank you to the entire staff at Hotel Commwealth and especially to Nick for being the best ever.

Hotel Commonwealth,Evan,United States of America,1 review,July 6  2017,9.2,The smell of fish in the lobby was overpowering.  We had to hold our breath when walking from the elevator.  Gross! Need ventilation help! We did not notice this last time we stayed there.  Also we did not like the shower head.  Even my wife at 5' 7" had to duck to wash her hair.  And. the pressure was uncomfortable. prickly feeling. and there was no way to change it.  We prefer a rain shower.,The location is great.  Also we like the style. it's modern without being in-your-face modern.  The  service is always great. front desk and in room dining.

Hotel Commonwealth,April,United States of America,1 review,June 26  2017,10,We had no issues during our stay.,This hotel is truly amazing. It's down the street from Fenway Park and is surrounded by beautiful buildings/scenery. My family (2 adults + 2 teenage boys) arrived earlier than our designated check-in time and were upgraded to a junior suite so that we could drop off our luggage before our Fenway tour/ RedSox game. The room was so clean. comfortable. and beautiful. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating throughout our stay and we can't wait to return.
Hotel Commonwealth,Paula,United States of America,1 review,June 20  2017,7.5,Dirty bed,The comforter in the room was dirty.  This was not a good situation as we paid a good amount to stay in this hotel.  It had make up and mascara all over it as if someone had laid down on the bed. I was going to ask for some money back on the stay.

Hotel Commonwealth,Tim,Canada,8 Reviews,June 8  2017,9.2,Bathtub drained very slow was the only problem.,We had a very pleasant stay at the Boston Hotel Commonwealth during our visit.The hotel was exceptionally very clean and comfortable.  The hotel location near the cafes. bars. restaurants and transit station made our visit to beautiful Boston very convenient.The hotel’s Front Desk staff plus the bell hops were all very polite.
Hotel Commonwealth,Kenneth,United States of America,4 Reviews,June 7  2017,9.6,It felt like the air was on constantly and not controlled by the thermostat. They had to cover a vent to prevent it from coming out but the noise kept me up most of the night.  Also some weird noises coming from the refrigerator.,The room was very spacious with separate sitting room.  We faced the street but could not hear any street noise.  The restaurants attached to the hotel are both superior.  Especially Island Creek Oyster Bar.  Excellent food and drinks!
Hotel Commonwealth,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,June 5  2017,9.6,Everything was great except for an unusual foul odor in the lobby between the front desk and elevator.  Smelled like rotting fish.,Location.  Proximity to Fenway.  Proximity to public transit.  Ease to get to airport.Rooms very clean and plenty of space.  Room overlooked Commonwealth Ave. but did not hear any street noise---well built windows!!  Quick work by Valet to get car every time.I would not hesitate to stay at hotel again on return trip to Boston.
Hotel Commonwealth,Amy,Cambodia,4 Reviews,May 30  2017,10,Both my son and I experienced our in room breakfast not being served on time.  And we have to call to get it delivered.  Both was resolved very quickly.  Not a reflection of the hotel since I believe it is being executed by one of the restaurants on the premise.  We prefer strong European style coffee and the coffee served was fine. but not strong enough for us.  But that is a personal preference.,The staffs are all excellent! Professional and kind and very efficient in responding to any issues. The restaurants on the property are both fantastic.
Hotel Commonwealth,Richard,United States of America,1 review,May 30  2017,9.2,N/A,Executive king suite was perfect for traveling with  our 23 year old daughter. We had a rollaway bed in the large sitting area and she essentially had her own room.
Hotel Commonwealth,David,United States of America,4 Reviews,May 29  2017,10,N/A,Bathroom and the rest of the room was big.  Many Boston Hotels squeeze you into a sardine can.  Not the Commonwealth.  We watched a Red Sox game and walked back to our hotel and had a drink within 5 mintues.
Hotel Commonwealth,UVA Alicia,United States of America,3 Reviews,May 28  2017,8.8,Blonde female conscierge who was abrupt when I asked for additional water to be sent to my room. She states "it should already be up there". Which it was. but had already drank it. which is why I requested more. Snooty attitude was not appreciated nor appropriate. We stay here often and have never been given "attitude" before when requesting something as simple as water. However the other concierges were quite pleasant and easy to deal with.,Room amenities and early check-in
Hotel Commonwealth,Mike,United States of America,1 review,May 7  2017,10,shower head seemed crappy compared to the excellence of the rest of the hotel and staff- was surprised it didn't have a better spray pattern.  Not bad enough to complain about. just being honest.,N/A
Hotel Commonwealth,Ks1543,United States of America,1 review,May 3  2017,10,Nothing - great hotel!,The bed was comfortable and the room decor was great.  The room service was also very good.  There are 2 great restaurants attached to the hotel and it is blocks away from Fenway.
Hotel Commonwealth,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,May 3  2017,9.6,The Eastern Standard and Island Creek Oyster Bar have some of the worst staffing. not all but just a few. We sat and watched good people get turned away or refused to be served after they were served. People like Nick Moreland at the Eastern Standard shouldn't be placed in the the position he's in we spent four days there and only ate there once after seeing him being very unprofessional. We spoke with the others staying at the hotel an they had seen or been  the victim of his behavior. As far as the oyster bar goes it was just as unprofessional as well. We got up and left before we even ordered. They really need to hired mature people for the position of being the first point of contact for there business. Not people with their own agenda to look important in front of other employees. When I returned home I immediately paid more attention to my greeters and other first points of contact of my business and thanked God I didn't  have employees as rude as these to businesses.,We loved the location it's a perfect setting for any baseball fan. Staff was excellent. very friendly and helpful. They made the stay worth it. Rooms were very  comfortable.
Hotel Commonwealth,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,May 2  2017,9.2,Handle on sliding bathroom door.... poor design as I pinched my fingers quite hard between the handle and the door casing as I guess I should have let go before the door was fully closed,Excellent location as we attended a game at Fenway. Room was available for an early check in on Sunday and we had a view of Fenway Park itself.
Hotel Commonwealth,Brian,United States of America,1 review,May 2  2017,7.1,The room was noisy from expressway traffic. There was no mini bar. Room service did not arrive after calling them.Another time someone was banging on the door w ice we didn't order. The bartender in the oyster restaurant was extremely rude!,Eastern standard was very good
Hotel Commonwealth,Daniel,United States of America,1 review,April 27  2017,6.7,We booked a room with a view of fenway and when we got their they said they upgraded us to another room. That room did not have a view of fenway. Also. the water on the shower was either scalding hot or cold. Lastly. our breakfast was not cooked all the way. For the amount of $700 for one night this was a huge disappointment,That is was close to Fenway ballpark
Hotel Commonwealth,Anonymous,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,April 27  2017,6.7,Wifi is extra if you need a decently fast connection. The room could use sound-proofing. as it is overlooking the highway. Also. a lot of noise emits from the hallway of the hotel - loud noises of people closing their doors etc. Gym was very outdated. No mini bar in the room. water bottles were not replaced. No coffee machine in the room. Front desk staff was not overly helpful or polite. Same with the bell desk - they don't even bother to open the door most of the time nor offer help with taxis/luggage etc.,Good location. well-sized room. Comfortable bed. Nice bathroom layout.
Hotel Commonwealth,Lynne,United States of America,1 review,April 25  2017,10,The view was not the best. but we were not visiting to stay in the room so it was not really an issue.  Would have liked a Keurig coffee maker in the room.,The room was very large and spacious and the Queen beds were very comfortable.  The bathroom was also very large and spacious and the shower head was heavenly!
Hotel Commonwealth,Lisandra,Puerto Rico,1 review,April 24  2017,8.8,Latte although very hot (how I really like) definitely needs to be stronger. Tasted like milk instead of coffee and was expensive.  :-(,Good location and great staff attention.Cozy hotel.
Hotel Commonwealth,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,April 20  2017,9.6,Were told there would be a light breakfast (bagels. juice. coffee) the day of the Marathon. Was all gone EARLY and not replenished. Provision of morning coffee would be nice for such a luxurious hotel.,Very clean and comfortable. Staff was exceptional in providing service and help. Eastern Standard restaurant was FABULOUS.
Hotel Commonwealth,Mike,United Kingdom,19 Reviews,April 20  2017,9.2,Poor vegetarian choice in restaurant and not labeled vegetarian. Charged $8 extra to have fish sauce removed so something vegetarian could be provided. When I pointed this out toA manager nothing was done. Had TV and music on in a beautiful restaurant!,Impressive room with a view. Helpful staff.. large lobby area. Having a bath and shower. Best hotel bed ever. Intelligent waiter in restaurant.
Hotel Commonwealth,Michele,United States of America,1 review,April 20  2017,9.2,N/A,The staff was very helpful and friendly. The rooms were very comfortable and clean.  I loved the location in Boston; we were visiting colleges with my sons.  We were a block walking to Fenway and BU.  The hotel is next to a subway stop and we took and easy ride to the Celtic's game. There was 711. Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks right next the Hotel. making it convenient to grab drinks. snack or coffee.
Hotel Commonwealth,Wade,Canada,1 review,April 19  2017,9.6,One small gripe was that modern-style shower was a little finicky -- it was tough to find the right temperature. Looked great. didn't perform so well.,The hotel location was fantastic. The staff were courteous and helpful. the room was clean and quiet with comfortable and up-to-date decor. The beds were excellent.
Boston Park Plaza,Linda,Ireland,4 Reviews,November 2  2017,10,I couldn’t find fault with this hotel.,Great location near Boston common and within walking distance of downtown. Staff were so friendly and helpful. The rooms were spotlessly clean and housekeeping staff were so efficient. I would highly recommend this hotel as a base for a sightseeing/shopping trip in Boston
Boston Park Plaza,Amelia,United States of America,1 review,November 2  2017,6.3,The room and bathroom were cute but claustrophobic in size--room was so narrow that my husband and I had to shimmy sideways around the end of the bed.  No view out of window whatsoever.  Bed was not very comfortable. and bottom sheet was ripped.  Room could have been cleaner--pubic hair on the bathroom floor. dirty tray table in room. dust visibly collected around carpet corners.  Noise from other hotel guests was clearly audible (at normal volume).,The lobby was beautiful and modern. and appeared recently updated.  The front desk staff were courteous and efficient.  The location was excellent for shopping and going to the Common and to restaurants.
Boston Park Plaza,Dan,United States of America,2 Reviews,November 2  2017,9.2,We had a dirty  pillow case in bathtub when we arrived!  We also had a small problem after requesting and receiving a late check out time of 2 pm.! Upon returning to hotel at 1:45 we were locked out of our room and upon going down to front desk (at 1:50 pm) were told we were late checking out!!  Front desk gentleman had somewhat of an attitude.........,Room was very roomy and bed was wonderful. Shades were great and kept out all light!!   Our check in lady was great!!!!
Boston Park Plaza,Beverly,United States of America,1 review,November 1  2017,5.8,Due to a leak they gave us 2 adjoining rooms not the 1 bedroom suite we’d booked....this caused a disappointment from the start! They should have upgraded us. this cost them a prospective customer who comes to Boston monthly. Rooms are small. peeling paint is just painted over.  No closet in our King room. a 3/4 cabinet which is not sufficient for a stay beyond 1 night.  Coffee maker crammed into a lower shelf of nightstand.  Rooms were quiet. bar area was lively. wait staff was not as cordial as rest of the staff.,Proximity to Newberry St.  Lobby area clearly renovated.
Boston Park Plaza,Philip,United States of America,4 Reviews,November 1  2017,7.9,The toilet was clogged and I was being charged with the fee even though it wasn't even our fault.,The places look new and it is located in a convenient area.
Boston Park Plaza,Ali,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 31  2017,6.3,Lots of things including check-in and room size.,This hotel is in a great location. There are lots of good restaurants and coffee shops nearby. There is a bank right across the road. Boston Common is 3 minutes' walk. The rooms are noisy. small and rather dated. The bedroom and bathroom were not that clean. The carpet was stained. There are long lines at check-in.
Boston Park Plaza,Ruth,Australia,1 review,October 30  2017,8.8,Check in was not good. Arrived tired at 6.30 pm ready for a shower.. room not ready until we started to get angry at 8.30pm.Paid for 2 superior king rooms.. reality was king beds squeezed into a traditional 1927 room. There wasn’t an issue but the advertising needs to be more honest,Location location location. Close to the T.. but walking distance to almost everything in Boston.Staff were polite and courteous Bar and casual eating restaurant were goodGym facilities excellent
Boston Park Plaza,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 29  2017,8.8,N/A,Our room was very small. and our view was of other buildings. I had asked to be on a higher floor with a view and was put on 5 with no view. People were very friendly. valet is $51 which should be noted for people stayin at the hotel.
Boston Park Plaza,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 28  2017,4.2,when we arrived one of the desk staff- a short. white man. was very impolite to me. they are very classic in this hotel. we did not fell welcome.  They look up you as you are rich or not. The room that we book was smaller than the rest in the hall.,breakfast was too expensive and you need to book a table. this is crazy.  outside a 100 steps are several coffee shops that you can have similar food for 50% less cost.
Boston Park Plaza,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 28  2017,7.1,While I understand this is a boutique hotel it was difficult getting ready in the bathroom.  No counter space and the bathroom door should be a pocket door vs a folding door.   Also the projecting frame around the tv is unnecessary and makes it difficult to walk around the bed.,Friendly staff. beautiful lobby and food at the restaurant was goid
Boston Park Plaza,Molly,United States of America,1 review,October 27  2017,7.5,As awesome as the common areas were. they could've put more money into the rooms. We got the "superior king" and the towels were a scratchy. the bathroom was tiny with one really small sink. the walls were very thin and maid service wasn't great. Definitely would've expected more for the money.,The lobby and common areas were beautiful. location was great. Right next to the Arlington green line T stop and very walkable.
Boston Park Plaza,Jeff,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,October 25  2017,9.2,The price. very expensive but needs must.,Exactly what you'd expect from a 4* hotel. very well located. excellent amenities. super room. very comfy bed
Boston Park Plaza,Michael,United States of America,1 review,October 24  2017,6.7,Way over priced. Very noisy. traffic. Also had music on   very low.  security bang on door and demanded us to open door.  So had to get dressed to open the door so they could tell us that we needed to turn the music off. Was only midnight and music was soft.,Nice place.
Boston Park Plaza,Malcolm,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,October 24  2017,5.0,Unfriendly staff door boy - large concierge male rude and ignorant. Elderly lady on concierge very little knowledge regarding Boston or just couldn’t bother.,Location
Boston Park Plaza,Nourah,Kuwait,5 Reviews,October 22  2017,7.5,Noisy. I could hear other guests while in my room if I turned off the AC. The lobby is constantly busy with multiple events taking place in the city. the hotel was booked throughout my stay. Some towels in the bathroom were not very clean (had stains on them). Should provide complementary bottled water in every room. not have to ask for it in the lobby / reception area.,Reliable wifi connection.Excellent location. within walking distance to the public garden. newberry street. boyleston street. boston public library. prudential center and copley plaza. The Arlington t stop (subway) is directly across the street from the main hotel entrance and connects you to the rest of the city through the green line. If your staying for 2 days or more. get a charlie card.
Boston Park Plaza,Tamar,Israel,5 Reviews,October 22  2017,8.8,when i made the reservation i orderd an extra bed (the hotel gives this option)for my small childwe  checked in at 1 oclock at night and there was no extra bed or an option for one,N/A
Boston Park Plaza,Anonymous,Canada,1 review,October 22  2017,6.3,Disappointed in tiny size of bathroom for a suite that accommodates 4 . Suite does not have a regular fridge (cooler only) .had to keep our medication in bags of ice during the stay. Changed bed linens were forgotten on the floor and found them there when we returned to room . The $20 extra fee should INCLUDE WATER IN THE COOLERS not at front desk ! not worth the money spent !,Bedroom and sitting area were spacious and clean . Hotel is very well located .
Boston Park Plaza,Anonymous,Canada,1 review,October 18  2017,4.6,booked a queen bed. Got a double. Room was smaller than my closet...not worth money. The toilet made a lot of noise when flushing. Could hear flush from other rooms. Bathrooms were way too small.,The staff was amazing to say the least
Boston Park Plaza,Anonymous,China,3 Reviews,October 18  2017,9.2,The room we had was little bit small and out of my expectation. However. the bed and the other facilities in the room were very comfortable. During one night of our visit around 11:00 PM. I heard the speaking of children from the nearby room. It was quite loud and annoying. but after a while. they stopped.,Location: It is situated between the Chinatown and the BackBay. so it is very convenient for me. shopping in the BackBay and enjoying the bubble tea in Chinatown. Facilities: All the facilities are great when I visited. The hotel shares the fitness center with the nearby hotel. so I have to walk across the street in order to exercise. However. all the facilities in the fitness center are awesome. Moreover. there is an Starbuck in the hotel. so it is very convenient to have breakfast without walking out the building during a cold windy morning. Generally speaking. the hotel is great
Boston Park Plaza,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 17  2017,5.8,The welcome was not warm when I arrived the receptionist told me  to pay $ 50 and $ 25 before to check-in the room. Although before  coming I had already called it was fixed that I had to enter the room at 6am but when I arrived he told me i could not check-in at 6am then he charge me $75,Location
Boston Park Plaza,Diana,Mexico,3 Reviews,October 17  2017,10,N/A,Excellent location. one block away from Boston Public Garden.

Boston Park Plaza,Ana,United States of America,6 Reviews,October 17  2017,5.4,old hotel . tight spaces . not nice bathrooms VERY EXPENSIVE for what if offers,old hotel . tight spaces . not nice bathrooms VERY EXPENSIVE for what if offers
Boston Park Plaza,Emma,United States of America,1 review,October 17  2017,5.0,N/A,Positive - the bed was very comfortable.Negatives - the room was tiny and the blind was broken. I paid $798 for a 2 night stay and i was presented with a box with broken blinds. I arrived at 11.30pm on Friday evening. I had warned the staff that i would arrive late. hoping it would save me time at check in. It didn't. I waited over 20 minutes to be seen or spoken to. I was handed over the key and no further instructions were given. No instructions on how to get to my room. what floor it was on or what number it was. I was hurried away after given the key card and only after i walked away did i realise that i had no idea where i was going. Throughout the stay i was genuinely uncomfortable asking any members of staff anything. I was made to feel like they couldn't be bothered and that I was a burden. I'm sure they're extremely ill treated too with low pay. but if i'm paying $400 per night then i don't care who that money goes to but i'd like to be treated with respect. It's really not worth the money. I'm staying at a 3 star hotel in Chicago for work and they treat guests like hotel guests should be treated. so don't believe the stars. If you find the rooms for $150 a night then by all means go ahead and book because it probably is worth that. but honestly. anymore and you're just throwing money away.
Boston Park Plaza,Anonymous,Canada,8 Reviews,October 16  2017,9.2,Rather old building so rooms also have old fashion floor plan design. My bathroom was very small. something you do not really see in a modern hotel of this category. But other than that. the hotel is well renovated and well maintained. That was not a deal breaker. I would use this hotel again.,Comfortable hotel. very well located. clean. good service.
Boston Park Plaza,Mary,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,October 16  2017,8.3,Bathroom VERY VERY small. I can't see how a big person could sit on  the toilet!!!!! Felt very pressurised to tip on arrival. Lots of charges not immediately obvious on bookings,Nice quiet clean room even though it was small
Boston Park Plaza,Anita,United States of America,1 review,October 16  2017,10,The resort fee that is mandatory.  They should only charge those who use the facilities.,Very helpful staff.  I was not happy with the room I was assigned and when I asked for change. the staff was very helpful and assigned me a nice room with a view.  The best thing about this hotel is that you can actually open the windows to let in fresh aire. something that I wish all the hotels could provide.  I always prefer fresh air to AC.
Boston Park Plaza,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,October 15  2017,5.8,The staff were poor. We had to wait approx 15min to get our luggage out of storage whilst various people told us it wasn't their job and walked away.,The room was large and the bed very comfortable.
Boston Park Plaza,Chris Shoemaker,Switzerland,14 Reviews,October 13  2017,6.7,Windows are of rather low quality. so unfortunately it was very noisy. In my opinion a clear no go for a hotel in this price range. Staff was also not very friendly. After all. I cannot really recommend this place despite the location is great.,Room was clean and comfortable. Location is great. close to many attractions in Boston.
Boston Park Plaza,Anonymous,Ireland,1 review,October 8  2017,9.6,The extra dinner bill that had been placed on our room that wasn't ours,Coffee bar in the morning. Location by the park was lovely for a walk in the morning.
Boston Park Plaza,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 8  2017,5.0,I was taken back with the poor quality of the room. if the tv was not so sizable it could have passed for a trap house. Business convenientions constantly going on...Saturday I had to fight to get through the lobby. When you pay shy of a grand for two nights you should not feel bombarded and too overwhelmed to exit and enter your hotel. We actually left the hotel restaurant after being seated because it was such chaos. Very disappointed,The gym was awesome. I'll give them that!
Boston Park Plaza,Anonymous,United States of America,6 Reviews,October 7  2017,6.7,For $300 a night I expected a little more space. and more comfort. hardly any room to place our empty luggage.  The hotel was just OK.  Granted it's downtown Boston.  Two days later we stayed at a Best Western. twice the space. much nicer room. comped breakfast and snacks in our room for half the price an hour out of downtown.  Location. Location. Location,Nothing jumped out as exceptional.
Boston Park Plaza,Zhenyu,China,2 Reviews,October 7  2017,6.7,the room is more like a part of a suite. there is a door between mine and the next one so I can hear every single word my "roommates" said. bad sound insulation!,location very central. easy walking distance to the park and Trinity church
Boston Park Plaza,Anonymous,Canada,3 Reviews,October 6  2017,7.1,confused check-in. booked room wasn't available. nonfunctional fridge and hairdryer. spotty room service. small size of room. few options for in-house dining. rates on some days were too high,excellent downtown location. tidiness. prestigious establishment. affordable rates. nearby Maggiano's was excellent restaurant

Boston Park Plaza,James,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 4  2017,9.2,The rooms were teeny. tiny. but not unexpected of a big city. downtown property.  Other than that. our stay was fabulous!,Loved being right downtown Boston!  It was an easy walk to great restaurants and sites.  It was just down the street from our bus tour company also.  The staff were very helpful. the room was quiet and we enjoyed the Starbucks which was on the property.
Boston Park Plaza,Wr,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 4  2017,10,Nothing.,The staff!  Mikiko at checkin was so professional and made changes to the reservation that I couldn't get done on Booking.com. Saved us about $400. It only got better. Late night bar staff Heather. Dave and others created a congenial atmosphere to talk and visit with other guests. We were called from home in the middle of the night of an unexpected death in the family. Dave changed all of our plane reservations. Heather came in early the next day to personally drive us to the airport. The rest of the staff took care of everything else with efficiency and more importantly. with compassion. We couldn't think. couldn't act. They made sure we didn't have to. They would have gotten the same review before. I'd give them a higher rating if I could for what they did after.
Boston Park Plaza,Vasily,Russia,93 Reviews,October 4  2017,6.3,You have to pay resort fee ("for free wi-fi"). It wasn't mentioned in the description on the booking.com. I hate resort fee. Include everything in your room rate &amp; show us the final price. It's tricky thing when you have to pay room rate + RESORT STUPID FEE. Parking is extremely expensive and service is terrible. After check out i was waiting for my car for 45 minutes. And nobody knows why,N/A
Boston Park Plaza,Merry,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 3  2017,7.9,Our room was extremely small with one queen sized bed.  Athough it was efficiently arranged to make use of the tiny space. it was more suitable for 1 person rather than two. The bathroom vanity had an open shelf on the bottom. but no room on the top. The tiny shelf above was unnecessarily narrow and cumbersome. i.e.. things were easily knocked off onto the floor. Due to the tiny space. we felt that the room was not a good value.,The hotel was mostly excellent. The atmosphere was upscale and beautiful. The breakfast buffet was one of the best we've ever had. The bed and pillows were comfortable.
Boston Park Plaza,John,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 2  2017,5.0,Very noisy.  We have stayed in roadside motels with better sound proofing.  Staff indifferent.  Breakfast v expensive.  A classic formica palace.,It was close to the Hertz car hire depot where we dropped the car.
Boston Park Plaza,Michelle,United States of America,5 Reviews,September 30  2017,5.8,Tiniest bathroom ever.

Staff at registration awesome.  Gave out free water bottles - much appreciated.
Boston Park Plaza,Anonymous,Hungary,18 Reviews,September 28  2017,2.9,We booked a deluxe king room... aaand it only had a tiny bathroom (see pictures) with a lot of mold. They could hardly squeeze the toilet in... The carpet and the wall cover looked like in a motel next to a highway... Noise from the surrounding rooms... We had to ask for robes and slippers for two times to get it provided. There was no heating... When we asked to call a cab for us then we were instructed to go outside and yell for one... what a great service.And if the resort fee (20USD/night) was mandatory. then it should be incorporated in the room price.,The best we liked was the moment when we finally left the hotel. Nothing else.
Boston Park Plaza,Pamela,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,September 28  2017,9.6,The extra amount for wi-fi which is a staple requirment these days !

Boston Park Plaza,Khris,Indonesia,1 review,September 28  2017,9.2,Price considered competitive since located in prime areas,Perfect location. Only 1 block from Boston Common Park. within walking distance to commercial areas. Room size is small / only perfect for couple. not for family. Good hospitality from the staff.
Boston Park Plaza,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 28  2017,7.9,I was a bit put off by the fact that I would see staff standing outside and they wouldn't open the door for guests entering and exiting. Also. for a hotel of this caliber. someone should have offered to take my bags to my room or assist with them upon arrival. I saw staff simply standing around instead of helping. I have stayed at a lot of nice hotels and never experienced this. I expect a certain level of service once I cross into a certain price bracket for hotels.,The hotel was beautiful and location was great for tourism.
Boston Park Plaza,Karsten,Denmark,2 Reviews,September 26  2017,5.4,Very small room. Incredible small shower cabin only 1.5 A4 sheet broad. Very noisy from 5am due to sharing wall with elevators. Missing many "features" Tha a superior room should have. It took 2 visits to reception (1.5hour) to get coffee maker which should have been there in the first place. Maid didn't supply pods for coffee maker. To time consuming to Persue the rest of the remaining items not supplied as it is described in the hotels own guide for Superior rooms.

Boston Park Plaza,Alison,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 25  2017,9.2,The room was incredibly small. I got a great deal on the rate (about 60% off). so I didn't mind. but I would have had a hard time with it if I had paid the full rate. Fortunately. I was traveling alone. It would have been hard with another person. especially if they were a friend or family member vs. a romantic partner.,The hotel is in a great location. The restaurant/club in the hotel (Strip) was definitely the place to be on a Saturday night. The common areas of the hotel like the entry and library (with cocktail hour) are very nice. Downtown parking garages are plentiful. and it's near a subway station.
Boston Park Plaza,Joe,United States of America,8 Reviews,September 25  2017,5.4,Well. first off. after the theater we ordered late snack. I had the hummus plate and it was only three hours before I was making regular tracks to the bathroom!!!'Really small and uncomfortable bathroom. bad lighting for reading in room. no newspapers at all in Plaza. I mean you can get a USA Today in any Redroof Inn but not THE Plaza?,location to Commons and theater district
Boston Park Plaza,Kai,Singapore,1 review,September 25  2017,3.3,Cheating,Paid WiFi was compulsory !!!!  USA 20.00I did not know that!!!! Not during booking in booking.comTotally unexpected. That’s illegal and expensive.
Boston Park Plaza,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 24  2017,6.3,Lobby very noisy. eating area out in middle of lobby and very noisy. room extremely small. and the bathroom was a joke. it was about 5 x 5 max. the sink was no larger than14 x 14 inches and no place to set anything. there was no bedspread on bed,Lobby too noisy. room extremely small. and bathroom smallest bathroom I have ever stayed in a hotel..
Boston Park Plaza,Angela,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,September 23  2017,7.5,Room cleanliness a little poor. that we had to ask for complimentary water on arrival. .,Location fab! Staff on reception friendly &amp; helpful. dinner at hotel was very good &amp; ambience at bar nice.
Boston Park Plaza,R.E.A,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,September 22  2017,8.8,The extra 'facility charge' for Wifi and extra TV services at $20 seemed a bit much. also breakfast buffet at $27 was fine but not exceptional. plenty of places nearby for a cheaper and good breakfast.,Impressive location and look of the hotel. felt quite luxurious. Staff were friendly and helpful and room was very nice.
Boston Park Plaza,Rozan,Saudi Arabia,2 Reviews,September 21  2017,8.3,There were none of these in the room: the do not disturb sign. slippers. box of tissues. shower cap and complementary water.,Location is great. Room was clean. Staff were friendly. I loved the service of holding the baggage for sometime after checkout until I finish my business.
Boston Park Plaza,Elizabeth,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 21  2017,7.9,See above note.,location was awesome... room with no upgrades was pricey... our trip to San Francisco was a similar great location. price point &amp; room space which included breakfast &amp; wine/cheese hour... this did not even include a fridge... the bathroom door was cut out to fit the toilet... bit hilarious for this price point.
Boston Park Plaza,Linda,United States of America,1 review,September 21  2017,4.2,I was given a very small room that  I could barely move around in. No room for luggage ... I bumped my head x2 on open bathroom door handle as I was getting up from toilet. The fan in room blew cold air in constantly. Reported to the front desk who promised to send mechanic but was a no show. Noisy at night with party goers etc. near elevator. Recommend not accepting room if given one like this at  a high price as I was given.,N/A
Boston Park Plaza,William,United States of America,4 Reviews,September 19  2017,5.8,The room was no bigger than a closet. It was advertised as a superior queen size room. the bed was a full-size not a queen size. It was difficult to even turn around in the bathroom it was so small.,Very convenient location
Boston Park Plaza,Valerie,United Kingdom,1 review,September 19  2017,5.8,The room was so small for 2 people  there wasn't any room to put the luggage...the TV was almost as big as the room.The bathroom was very small.  Very disappointing.  They never replenished the body wash we had to ask for more at reception,location
Boston Park Plaza,Huan,Germany,4 Reviews,September 19  2017,7.9,The wall is very thin. we heard all noises from drunk guests in the corridor on Saturday night - absolutely no sleep after long flight which is very annoying.,Easy check in and check out. nice location. friendly staff. plenty space in the room.
Boston Park Plaza,Anonymous,Canada,8 Reviews,September 18  2017,9.2,No airing in the bathroom. Loud air conditioning in the bedroom.,The hotel is excellent - it's just a bit too expensive for inconveniences like a loud air conditioning and a lack of a fan (airing) in the bathroom. The bed is super comfortable and the neighbourhood is perfect. I would definitely go back if the prices were lower.
Boston Park Plaza,Jeremy,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,September 16  2017,7.1,The staff are very efficient. but process driven. so you feel like a number,Great location for seeing the city of Boston. Lots of great restaurants in the area and the parks are literally arround the corner.
Boston Park Plaza,Kate,Cayman Islands,4 Reviews,September 15  2017,8.3,the walls are so thin i could hear everything going on in the rooms on either side of me.  Probably wouldn't therefore recommend it.,cleanliness and location superb
Boston Park Plaza,Mairead,Ireland,1 review,September 15  2017,7.9,There isn't anything about the hotel itself and staff I did not like. I did not like or agree with having to pay the nightly resort fee of 20 dollars which really means the "free wifi" is not free. If you are staying a number of nights this extra fee really adds up!!!,I found the location good in terms of sightseeing. most things were in walking distance or you could get a T train and there was a station close to the hotel. Beds were very comfy and the rooms were lovely. clean and nicely decorated with everything we needed (safety deposit box. iron. hair dryer etc). I would of liked the room to be a little bigger but we weren't in the room long so it wasn't a big deal.
Boston Park Plaza,Anonymous,Kuwait,1 review,September 13  2017,9.6,The restrooms were small and the room service food was not good.,It is next to Boston public park and Newbury's street where all the shops are. The hotel lobby have their own bar. Starbucks and Connor's restaurant.
Boston Park Plaza,Masmas11,Saudi Arabia,9 Reviews,September 13  2017,9.6,N/A,the room was big and spacious and clean .the breakfast was really yummy and many variety.i like the easy access to a starbucks from the lobby. and very close to many thing and the part one block away.
Boston Park Plaza,Peter,United Kingdom,10 Reviews,September 13  2017,7.9,Less noise from outside...and we were on the 10th floor (room 10079 to be avoided). Lack of curtains (the room only has blinds) did not help with the noise levels. Also we were cold and the aircon set to 24 deg C did not warm it. Service levels in the restaurant are a bit hit and miss - you can sit there for ages without being checked on. In the library there are buttons to press to ask for a server - but they hardly ever turn up. Major queues at check in - the lobby is like a busy airport.,Good central location. Comfortable and large room. Good wifi. albeit part of the "amenity" charge added on per night. Excellent breakfast - truly superb. Lunch dishes also good. The lady on the tours desk was excellent - very helpful and good advice.
Boston Park Plaza,Jamie,United States of America,1 review,September 12  2017,9.6,I wish there was a late night room service option. I got in at 11:15 PM and had to order domino's and utilize the vending machines for dinner. That being said. the room and lobby amenities were fantastic.,The room and even the provided shampoo and body wash were modern and a step up. The wifi was fast and reliable. The lobby library was a fantastic place to work and take a conference call. It was off to the side of the busy lobby so it was quiet enough but still lively enough and not as cramped as working in your room.
Boston Park Plaza,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 12  2017,6.3,N/A,I get that I received a "discounted" rate of 149.00. however. I booked the day before. and I know that hotels will offer discounts so that all the rooms can be filled.  My room (10077) was ridiculously small.  The bathroom had no room for me to spread out my sundries. there was no refrigerator or mini bar. and I had a view of a wall.
Boston Park Plaza,Dom,United States of America,5 Reviews,September 11  2017,10,N/A,Beautiful Hotel. Friendly staff. Clean comfortable rooms. "The Common" lounge was great with great service and delicious food! Great location.
Boston Park Plaza,dpantaza,United States of America,5 Reviews,September 11  2017,7.9,The room was small and there was not desk.,The bed and the cable TV movie channels and quality were very comfortable. The venue was great for a conference.
Boston Park Plaza,Fd,United States of America,1 review,September 11  2017,4.6,We checked in early and were told we would be called when our room was ready. Nobody called. finally after 5 hours of waiting. we checked in at 3 anyway. After a cross-country flight on your birthday. thats the last thing you want to do is wait in the lobby for 5 hours. For two nights. we had to listen through the paperthin connecting door to the people next door have very loud sex. When I called down to complain. nothing was done. In addition. the housekeeping people ignored our note to leave the bowls that were in the room there so we could use them for breakfast each morning (they were clean). and didn't change the sheets once while we were staying there for a week. They never cleaned the bathroom and after 3 days I called down and had to complain 4 times before someone came. When they did. they didn't even take our request into account. They made the bed only. I had to call down a 5th time to get them to come again to clean the room properly.,The people at the front desk were very nice and tried their best to be helpful. The gym is great.
Boston Park Plaza,Laura,United States of America,1 review,September 11  2017,5.4,Room was extremely tiny. no space in bathroom for personal items. We were near the elevator which was quite noisy in middle of the night &amp; early am. Coffee was not restocked after 1 st night.,Beautiful. busy lobby. Very attentive doormen.
Boston Park Plaza,Anonymous,Canada,6 Reviews,September 10  2017,5.8,The rooms were minuscule. we are skinny folk but all and we could barely move around. There seemed to have been zero thought put into the renovations. Everything from the fact that the ceiling in the shower was bubbling from no exhaust fan. the view was awful. courtyard. If you are claustrophobic at all do not stay here.,The location was great and the staff was great...housekeeping. desk. concierge and the gym was amazing.
Boston Park Plaza,Atalanta,United Kingdom,19 Reviews,September 10  2017,7.9,Our room looked into the interior of the building and was a little gloomy The service was slightly indifferent eg we asked for a porter to help with the bags and s/he never showed up at the roomOut bathroom was tiny with barely enough space to sit on the toilet,Location great
One-Bedroom on D Street Apt 151,Joanne,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 7  2017,9.6,N/A,This is the nicest private apartment we've ever stayed in. No detail was missed. Concierge even secured us a replacement coffee maker. And we had great Starbucks coffee in the lobby while we waited!
Comfort Inn Boston,Mmg,United States of America,1 review,November 2  2017,7.9,What I was so impressed about was the staff.  Each one I encountered was the utmost helpful courteous and oh so pleasant and nice.  The flaws I saw just did not matter  as they were  minor . If the staff had bee.n just there to collect a paycheck o would have been overly critical.   I would stay here again,The facility was not out of this world bit it was comfortable and reasonable clean and I could see staff doing upkeep on the building as well as rooms so it is obvious that comfort inn took pride and card in the hotel.
Comfort Inn Boston,Visitor,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 25  2017,5.0,Our sheets were covered in someone else’s hair when we pulled the blankets back. We told the front desk and he apologized and gave us new sheets so we changed them out for clean ones. They obviously hadn’t been changed between guests. No excuse for that,Location-close to city easy to get an Uber
Comfort Inn Boston,Iain,United States of America,1 review,October 21  2017,6.7,Airport shuttle was not punctual. The main reason for selecting this hotel was the airport shuttle. when that does not work properly. the stay is not too good.,N/A
Comfort Inn Boston,Julia,United States of America,4 Reviews,October 19  2017,5.4,Toilet wouldn't flush well. bathroom fan didn't work. light would go on and off magically.  Poor infastructure.  Dressed up nicely but falling apart.,Good breakfast and airport shuttle.
Comfort Inn Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 17  2017,3.8,Facility really needs updating. It’s looks dirty and dingy. TV reception was poor and a couple of the the lamps did not function at all. Over priced for the quality.,Cheapest in town
Comfort Inn Boston,James,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,October 7  2017,7.5,Clearer instructions/method required as to best way to reach hotel from airport also returning to airport. Everything regards this matter is still a bit vague.,Staff very helpful and friendly. We were able to check in much earlier when we asked to leave luggage which was a great help to us. Overall good value for money.
Comfort Inn Boston,Lars,Denmark,18 Reviews,October 6  2017,5.4,N/A,The good news is the shuttle service they have to the railroad station making it easy to get in and out of Boston. The bad news is the lousy and miserable breakfast they serve in these joints where everything is made of plastic to the tune of $ 240.- a night.
Comfort Inn Boston,Santina,Canada,7 Reviews,October 4  2017,8.3,2 of us the room only 1 reg coffeeTv options poor - would've liked to watch a movie-other than bowling alley or subway no restaurant in walking distance - arrived at nite &amp; didn't want to drive in area we don't know - ended up ordering on pizza,The staff was very helpful n friendly- bed was comfortable &amp; hotel clean
Comfort Inn Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 1  2017,8.5,The airport shuttle was a disaster.  We waited 2 and a half HOURS to get a pickup in spite of ten phone calls when we were consistently given some variation of "He'll be right there; he's just coming from the other terminal."  Guest services staff get an F.  But when we discussed it with the manager. she quickly offered apologies backed up with a refund.  So she gets an A!,The manager on site was extremely accommodating when there was a problem.  She worked to be sure that we felt our issue had been addressed appropriately.  See below "What didn't you like?" for the issue
Comfort Inn Boston,Brenda,Canada,4 Reviews,September 28  2017,7.5,unfortunately there is not much around the hotel ie. restaurants unless you count the bowling alley,shuttle service was great considering this is not inside the city proper
Comfort Inn Boston,Calvin,Canada,3 Reviews,September 27  2017,7.1,Room was non smoking but had a slight smell of smoke-everything elsewas fine,The hotel has a free shuttle to the "Red Line"3.3km away that was quite handy and even had a pickup option after 11pm. our checking was early and Krystal at the front desk was very Helpful .even picking up in idle conversation that it was my wife's Birthday - upon arrival back to the hotel after an outing to Fenway Park my wife was pleasantly surprised to find a lovely box of delicious chocolates.the next morning we had breakfast (included) it was well presented and tasty.checking out we received good advice on how to make it to the car rental pickup location In Boston-overall a very pleasant stay.   :-)
Comfort Inn Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,September 25  2017,5.8,Very expensive for what you got ie just a room. No restaurant or even bar on site. Breakfast was very 'mass produced' and un-appetising after a week in delightful B and Bs.,Staff helpful. Clean and comfortable.
Comfort Inn Boston,Doreen,United States of America,1 review,September 21  2017,9.6,Nothing.,Very comfortable bed w/lots of pillows. good water pressure. clean. When we left a tip for the maid. she left a "Thank You So Much" note. Eggs were bland. but they have to be. sausage a bit overdone; however. it's impossible to please everyone regarding food - free or not. The waffle &amp; everything else were great!!
Comfort Inn Boston,Joy,United States of America,1 review,September 20  2017,3.3,Lamp was broken in room. called the front desk to fix it...no one showed up. I had to go down and talk to them several hours later after I got sick of waiting and they finally sent someone. The shuttle bus driver (Juan. driving Hotel 4 license plate bus. broke the law by talking on his handheld cell phone while driving. I called him out on it and he was VERY rude saying "You have no proof!" He could have at least said he was sorry and wouldn't do it again or something. I sent a complaint to the hotel about it and no one responded to me. It is not only illegal but he was putting hotel guest lives at risk on the road!,N/A

Comfort Inn Boston,Kc2017,United Kingdom,9 Reviews,August 30  2017,5.4,Rooms at the back of the hotel are noisy because of trainline.Rooms have small windows so are very dark.

The market across the street made it easy to get additional food for the day.The entire staff was friendly . polite and accommodating.The breakfast  was satisfying .

Comfort Inn Boston,Stephanie,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 6  2017,8.8,When we were checking out (at check out time). there was a worker in the small lobby that was trying to shampoo the carpet....pretty bad timing because there were a lot of people checking out. he was pretty rude about people stepping on the rug. but there was really no where else to stand.,The shower was great and I liked the type of shampoo/conditioner you guys give complimentary!

Comfort Inn Boston,Danielle,United States of America,1 review,July 4  2017,6.7,The drain in the bathtub was broken. I couldn't adjust the air conditioning since there was no knob. The train going by made it very difficult to sleep.,The price was good and the place was clean

Comfort Inn Boston,Annette,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 24  2017,3.8,The hotel staff was not very friendly or helpful.  The hotel lobby was under construction during the time we stayed there and the price is way too high for where that hotel is located and that we only had a double bed in our room.  It was also not accessible to many restaurants or stores.  I would not stay in this hotel again!,N/A
Comfort Inn Boston,Ramon,Philippines,2 Reviews,June 22  2017,7.9,The shuttle service has to be improved.  A lot of times. the twice an hour shuttle to JFK Umas and vv did not arrive on time or was delayed for an hour.  Hotel guests have accumulated and since there is no queueing system. people sometimes just cut in the line.,Location was very good! The free breakfast was a delight; hot pancakes. assortment of bread. hot eggs and sausages. fruits. coffee. tea of hot chocolate.  Value for money - recommended!
Comfort Inn Boston,Perry,United States of America,1 review,June 20  2017,5.0,The elevator was rather loud and noisy going in it and there was a lot of loud talking early in the morning which sounded like the room service staff as well as the toilet in my room running every so often. Nothing major but a few little things adding up.,The room was very cozy which was a huge plus for me. Felt nice and personal.
Comfort Inn Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,8 Reviews,June 13  2017,5.4,First of all. the restaurant. the bar. the bowling alley. and candy store are NOT on site as advertised.  It was a 5 minute walk down a very busy highway that. in fact. you had to go under an overpass and cross the street.  When we first arrived. our room smelled horrible; we were given a new room which was better but the toilet continued to run and did not function properly.  There were signs for an ice machine on our floor but that didn't exist as well; The ice machine on first floor never had ice.  They did provide breakfast from 6:00 to 10:00 only and the food was terrible (stale).  The staff was friendly and were apologetic about the misrepresentation.  The shuttle service only runs on the hour. thus we had to Uber everywhere.  The closest T station was .9 miles away.  I have stayed in Boston multiple times and decided to stay alittle further from downtown to save money.  In reality. I spent more money.  Would not recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to explore Boston on vacation.,the staff was friendly and helpful.
Comfort Inn Boston,Norman,Bermuda,1 review,June 10  2017,9.6,The safe in the room never worked properly.even when had someone to fix it. They don't come sooner enough when problem existed.  I had meetings to go to.,N/A
Comfort Inn Boston,Ry,United States of America,1 review,June 8  2017,3.3,Staff were extremely rude. especially the guy at the front when we arrived. (I said thank you and he flat out ignored me). They even left a bill for $5 at the door even though we pre-paid. Hotel is dingey; the comforter smelled. the bathtub was dirty. the toilet ran the whole night.,Close to our destination (JFK Library) and a grocery store.
Comfort Inn Boston,Jennifer,South Africa,8 Reviews,June 6  2017,10,No negatives.,After a cramped flight to Boston. we were very pleasantly surprised and ever so happy to have chosen Comfort Inn (900 William T Morrissey Blvd. Boston).  Although the hotel is further out from downtown Boston and the Logan International Airport. the hotel (along with their Sister Hotel – Ramada) offers a free shuttle to and from Logan International as well as to and from the nearest train station (JFK /UMass).  The shuttles run from -+ 7h00 until 23h00 with numerous helpful drivers.  If you arrive in Boston via Logan International you can call the hotel via the fabulous electronic info board at Door B115 by baggage claim else you can follow signage for 'hotel courtesy bus' (which will in turn take you to Door B115).  The hotel’s front desk will confirm how many need a shuttle and how long you will need to wait (approximately 35mins).    Once the shuttle arrived. we were warmly greeted by Bill. helped to load our bags and whisked off to the hotel.  Upon our hotel arrival. Gladimyr on the front desk was fabulous and helped us with a swift check in process.  Our room was beautifully decorated and comfortable.  We were very pleasantly surprised with a small fridge to hold our coldrinks.  The room and en suite were clean with everything we needed from lots of towels. basic toiletries. coffee maker and a comfortable bed.  The hotel itself although a distance from downtown Boston was in a perfect location namely across the road from a big affordable supermarket (Stop &amp; Shop) along with a Subway (for sandwiches). CVS Pharmacy and Bowling Alley within walking distance.  If you have your own vehicle. there is plenty on site parking at the front of the hotel.  The hotel has free wifi throughout and a delicious complimentary breakfast just off the lobby which consisted of cereals. waffles. fruit. eggs. meats. muffins. bagels. yoghurt to name a few along with juices and hot drinks.
Comfort Inn Boston,Cody,United States of America,1 review,May 25  2017,7.9,Had to wait nearly an hour to check in because they couldn't locate our Booking.com reservation. When we were finally given a room. nobody apologized for the delay or explained what happened.,The breakfast had good offerings and the room was spacious. Compared to other hotels in the Boston area. this one offered a great deal for the price.
Comfort Inn Boston,Michael,Canada,1 review,May 24  2017,4.6,Air conditioning did not work. They tried 3 times to repair. Wake up call never came. Other guests fighting in the hall at 3:30 am,Proximity to subway. And access to   downtown Boston.
Comfort Inn Boston,Abdel,Israel,3 Reviews,May 20  2017,5.0,I highly recommend adding a picture and detailed of the airport shuttle on the website. As there are to different confort inn hotels with two different shuttle and it is easy to mix them. I took the wrong one and had to go back to the airport and wait for the right one. All in all it took me additional 2 hours to het to the hotel,N/A
Comfort Inn Boston,Adrian V. Hernandez,United States of America,40 Reviews,May 15  2017,7.5,Breakfast is light.,Comfortable bed. good wifi. clean bathroom. The size of the room was good. Close enough to downtown. The hotel offers free transportation to the UMASS metro station.
Comfort Inn Boston,Debra,Canada,1 review,May 3  2017,9.2,Breakfast was rather blah.,We were stranded at Boston Logan due to bad weather in Toronto. This was the least expensive hotel within 10 miles of the airport that had a shuttle. It was still ridiculously expensive (all Boston hotels seem crazy overpriced!) at $169USD but we needed a place to sleep. That being said. Dan the shuttle driver was great. the young lady at the reception desk (who's name escapes me) was very friendly and helpful and the beds were divine. Even though the Boston transit train runs near the hotel I had one of the best sleeps I've had in weeks! The room was clean and the breakfast was fine. I know that I'll never intentionally visit Boston again. due to the high pricing. but if I'm ever stranded at the airport there. I'll call this hotel first.
Comfort Inn Boston,Sheri,United States of America,1 review,May 1  2017,6.3,Breakfast was too much carbs (in all forms)!  Location kind of skeevy and not within walking distance of anything.,Bed was fine.  Room was fine.  Staff were lovely.  Nice that the place provided a shuttle to nearest T stop. though times were not quite as frequent as would be desirable.
Comfort Inn Boston,Mitchell,United States of America,1 review,May 1  2017,6.3,$4.95 surcharge to be signed for upon registering for "incidentals" whether used or not. Never saw this before.,We were at the property for less than 12 hours. Nothing great or terrible.
Comfort Inn Boston,M,United States of America,1 review,April 21  2017,7.9,The breakfast was alright for the price. would have liked several more options but overall pretty good.  I didn't like that the first room we went to smelled like smoke and could not open the windows to get air so I spoke with the manager and helped us get a better room.  Overall pretty pleased with my stay for the price.,The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  We were in one room that smelled like smoke (looks like guests really don't care about the policies) and was switched to another room without a problem.  I did like the free parking which is an added bonus and near the train station and can take a taxi into the city which is not too expensive either.  Good bed to sleep as well.  The location is great for someone or a couple needing to stay for a few days and not concerned about food and plans to be out most of the time.
Comfort Inn Boston,Lynn,United States of America,1 review,April 19  2017,8.8,I ended up taking a later than normal morning shower and the quantity of hot hot water was lacking.  I still ended up with a hot shower but towards the end I had to adjust the faucet knob to hotter to achieve the same level of hot water as I started with.,The room smelled fresh - like the commercials for a fabric softener spring rain. April fresh. clean linen. whatever you want to call that fresh clean smell in your own head that's what it smelled like which was really great.  The bed and pillows (supplied in both firm and soft!!!!)  were wonderful. awesome. really great!! Would love to know the brands so I could buy them for my bed at home. Firm but not too firm. held their shape and didn't go flat.   The mattress had enough support but not memory foam stiff and hot. Felt great waking up in the morning.
Comfort Inn Boston,Anthony,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 19  2017,8.3,They had problems with one of their shuttle drivers being out. but they did their best to keep a good shuttle service going to the MBTA and the airport. Not much choice of places to eat within easy walking distance,Front desk and shuttle drivers were helpful - as long as there are no problems with the shuttle it really doesn't take long to get to downtown Boston - and the price is way. way lower than downtown hotels
Comfort Inn Boston,Jason,Australia,5 Reviews,March 22  2017,7.9,The shuttle bus pickup from Boston Exhibition and Convention Center is a disaster. Very hard to contact the shuttle bus for pickup. the exact pickup location changes.,The shuttle bus drop you off to the nearest subway station as well as the airport.
Comfort Inn Boston,Joseph,United States of America,1 review,March 20  2017,7.5,Room had a slight odor to it like someone smoked in it though it stated it was a non smoking room. Wall paper was coming off of the walls near the ceiling in the bathroom. Parking stalls were limited.,Location. price. cleanliness of room. Friendliness of staff
Comfort Inn Boston,Linda,Canada,7 Reviews,February 16  2017,7.1,I found the distance from the airport to be long.  The pickup from Logan did not arrive for 70 minutes! Then we went a round about feeling route. quite different from the return to Logan the next day.  Not sure how to explain it!,As usual for the Comfort Inn chain the rooms were fine. comfortable and clean. Staff were helpful if a little uncertain what happened to our shuttle pickup.
Comfort Inn Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,February 9  2017,9.6,Facility is old and needs a freshening.,Staff very nice. Location is perfect for our needs. Breakfast is better than expected for the price of the room.

Comfort Inn Boston,Lauren,United States of America,1 review,January 6  2017,8.3,When traveling for pleasure. I enjoy sleeping in. The location is great for traveling but the outside commotion makes it tough for sleeping in.,Very nice location. close to the interstate which is convenient when trying to locate hotel when traveling from out of state. Checked-in and out with no issues and even got local food delivery right to the room. Very comfortable and welcoming.
Comfort Inn Boston,Terry,United States of America,1 review,December 13  2016,7.1,The hotel is located near train tracks.  That did not bother us. but others may object to the frequent passing of trains.,We checked in late and left early.  The room was just fine.  We appreciated the lift to the airport at 5:00 am.
Comfort Inn Boston,Susan,United States of America,3 Reviews,December 13  2016,7.5,I was told at the last minute that I would have to pay for parking even thought it was only for three nights.  I chose this hotel because it was advertised as free parking.  I complained and wasn't charged but it soured my experience.,The bed was comfortable. the room was small but workable. didn't have time for breakfast as I had an early flight.
Comfort Inn Boston,Susan,United States of America,5 Reviews,December 2  2016,10,The pull out sofa in the suite was in need of a firmer mattress. It sank in the middle...not much support ...just okay for a child but not an adult of more than 150 lbs.,N/A
Comfort Inn Boston,Tanis,Ecuador,5 Reviews,November 17  2016,9.2,N/A,The bed WAS like a cloud. and the breakfast selection was amazing.  Perfect to meet up with family after a late-arrival flight.  Liberty Dog Park along the ocean was a great place for a quick morning walk from the hotel after breakfast and before check out.  Enjoy!
Comfort Inn Boston,Jenifer,United States of America,1 review,November 16  2016,6.7,My pillow still smelled like cigarettes :( I'm allergic.  So I didn't sleep great. It's a little dated. but I appreciate the great rate,Didn't have much time.  but the breakfast looked good.  The shuttle was fantastic.  Thanks
Two-Bedroom on D Street Apt 136,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 31  2017,10,The only thing we didn't like was there was no trash can in the kitchen. The spare bathroom light was messed up all weekend. We couldn't see to put makeup on in there. They tried to fix it but it had something wrong with fixture. The sitting area in living room was tiny. It only had a loveseat and one chair. We felt like it could of had a full size couch.,The beds were very comfortable and the apartment was very clean. Very quiet area at night.
Two-Bedroom on D Street Apt 136,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 21  2017,5.0,Keys nor garage door opener were not available upon arrival. it took us 30 minutes to get to our room and we had to call the reception for opening and closing our door every. The location is not very good as it is loud (airplanes landing and starting and trucks driving by very frequently).,Flat was equipped with all kitchen tools and it was spacious.
Two-Bedroom on D Street Apt 136,Anders,Sweden,4 Reviews,July 3  2017,8.3,Large living room. but surprisingly few seats.,Modern and well equipped kitchen. Good wifi.
Courtyard Boston Copley Square,Christopher,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 27  2017,6.7,Had to change rooms because of very noisy and poor air conditioning. but second room was better.  Probably typical of Boston. but the price per night was not good value for money during the week for the facilities. Rooms a little tired.,Good central location. close to restaurants / bars and a short walk to harbour area. Staff tried to be helpful.
Courtyard Boston Copley Square,David,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,October 23  2017,9.2,Would have liked a glass of fruit juice with the breakfast option.,Friendly staff and comfortable room.  Only 5 minutes walk from the airport shuttle bus to Copley Square. Nice area.
Courtyard Boston Copley Square,Carol,United States of America,1 review,October 3  2017,9.6,I wish it could be less expensive but for the area I know it is compatible. It is just that I don't have enough money to stay multiple nights.,All of the staff was very friendly and helpful. The bed was very comfortable.
Courtyard Boston Copley Square,Susan,Canada,1 review,October 1  2017,10,N/A,Well appointed rooms. Very close to many lovely restaurants and shopping.

Courtyard Boston Copley Square,Krissie,Australia,2 Reviews,September 24  2017,8.3,Slightly outdated bathroom,Good basic hotel amongst an expensive lot of options in Boston. Room has everything you need. bed extremely comfortable and fantastic air conditioning.
Courtyard Boston Copley Square,Robert,Singapore,4 Reviews,September 10  2017,8.3,Our room was on the second floor. with a lot of street light. You can hear plumbing in the night. We booked to include breakfast. This was not shown on the booking confirmation. The staff gave us a voucher. but given it is pretty well all a la carte you may have extra charges. say for a cappuccino.,This is a business hotel. no frills. but with a comfortable room for two. over five nights. Having your ironing board and iron is helpful. Great location. Just behind Boston Public Library. close to Copley T and Back Bay Station. Prudential Center has all the shops you want. and around Copley you have a lot of restaurants and retail.Staff are all very friendly and helpful. If you want fresh flowers and restaurant choices. this is not for you. but the breakfast is copious and geared to those who need to eat fast.
Courtyard Boston Copley Square,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 6  2017,4.2,The front desk staff was very unhelpful. I had called 2 days prior to arrival to confirm our room was a suite. I was told booking.com never should have let me book a king room for 2 adults and 2 kids. And no it was not a suite. As a Marriott rewards member I asked Charlotte if she could change it. At first she said no because I booked with booking.com. Then she discussed that I would need a 2 queen suite. and asked if I could hold for a moment. when she came back she said I was all set- I was thrilled and thanked her profusely. Upon arrival. there was no record of our conversation. and no suites were left. Apparently when she had said I was "all set." that only meant she was getting off the phone with me. We were also told we would not get Marriott points because they don't honor booking.com bookers. The room we were given (1007) was covered in black mold in the shower and on the cieling. I showed the pictures to the front desk staff and was told "most people are happy with this room" and that he would give us some Marriott points to compensate. They have not shown up in the account and I have to assume they won't be.,My son had breakfast there one morning. and his egg dish was surprisingly good
Courtyard Boston Copley Square,Casey,United States of America,1 review,September 2  2017,7.1,We were charged $51/day for parking even though we didn't have a car. When I noted this to the front desk at checkout. the front desk person reluctantly removed the charges but was surly and unapologetic. The place was absurdly expensive for what we got; but that's Boston for you.,Clean room.
Courtyard Boston Copley Square,puccettini,Canada,12 Reviews,August 23  2017,4.6,Curtains in room stained and dirty.

Courtyard Boston Copley Square,Marlene,United States of America,1 review,May 30  2017,6.0,There was a constant noise in the room which sounded like it was coming from the pipes which was annoying.

Courtyard Boston Copley Square,Qin,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 28  2017,9.6,The room was often too cold in the night. and the thermostat did not respond to increases in set temperature.,The rooms were very comfortable. and clean. The addition of the sheep (mascot) was adorable.

Courtyard Boston Copley Square,E,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 24  2017,9.2,I am a Marriott Rewards member and expected to have my stay included in the rewards program. I was told by staff at the hotel that they could not add my stay to the Marriott rewards program as I had used a "third party" booking agent which did not qualify for the rewards program. I felt misled by your advertising regarding the Marriott Reward program. I hope that this can be resolved in a positive manner as I have used your service in the past and would like to do so in the future as well as remaining a Marriott Rewards Member.I would like to hear from you regarding this issue. Thank you.,The hotel and room was to our expectations. The staff was very friendly and helpful.City Table Restaurant is an excellent place to eat all meals. The host and wait staff are excellent and the food is very good with reasonable prices. It is an easy one block away. The location of the hotel is great as it is close to shopping and historical sites within easy walking distance.
Courtyard Boston Copley Square,JohnMcMente,United States of America,13 Reviews,April 16  2017,7.1,The air conditioning in the room was not adjustable.  There was a little sign that said 'slide lever to desired comfort level' but then the switch on the side had only three settings: Hi. Off. Lo. which seemed to be the fan speed.  During the night the room got to 78 F - very uncomfortable.,Nina at check in was really nice.  The doormen were also very pleasant.  There was a booklet explaining the history of the property in the room.  Wi Fi was strong.  It was Marathon weekend and the city was buzzing. but our room on the 2nd floor was still quiet enough.
Courtyard Boston Copley Square,Matthew,United States of America,5 Reviews,March 20  2017,9.6,The valet parking is $49. but that's pretty typical for hotels in this area.

The room was quiet. comfortable. and very clean.
Courtyard Boston Copley Square,Gregory,United States of America,2 Reviews,February 5  2017,10,Unfortunately. there was no breakfast included.  There was a little cafe just off the lobby that offers Starbucks products - but at a Starbucks price. too.,The hotel is conveniently located!

Courtyard Boston Copley Square,Layla,United States of America,1 review,November 2  2016,8.8,The price was a little steep. but that's to be expected given its location. Also. there was not breakfast included in the cost. which is not the best if you're traveling on a budget.,The room was very spacious and the location was fantastic. Right near the Copley subway stop and easily accessible. The staff was also helpful and kind.
Courtyard Boston Copley Square,Kara,United States of America,1 review,November 1  2016,7.5,I didn't realize how small the hotel was. the pictures made it look huge. room was smaller than expected but still nice place. not loud or busy. The bad part... We had to get new keys THREE TIMES throughout our stay because they just stopped working. After all our frustration they did not offer anything like a complementary breakfast or something! I'm a very easy going person. but I also understand customer service very well and they should have done something for us. Still a nice hotel nonetheless,Great location. clean room. comfortable bed. big bathroom. room service was great.. fresh towels everyday
Courtyard Boston Copley Square,ReeseVos,Malaysia,33 Reviews,October 16  2016,5.4,-There was cigarette smoke coming out of our ventalators into the room every night. I am pregnant so this was very uncomfortable. The smell was so strong that even our clothes smelled of cigarette smoke (in a smoke-free hotel)-the tv had to be reset continiously to make the sound work-our key card stopped working and we were stuck outside our room-blow dryer didnt work-paid quite a bit for a king room. so its disappointing when you get a dark room with windows directly looking into another brick building,-Starbucks coffee downstairs -Location-beautiful building-friendly check-in staff
Courtyard Boston Copley Square,Shaikha,United States of America,1 review,October 12  2016,7.1,I thought that the hotel charge was pretty overpriced for the services it offered. The facilities were old and my hallway smelled like dirty laundry water. The only excellent aspect of my stay at the courtyard Mariott at Copely was its location.. not the hotel itself. Overall. I would say this hotel would be ranked fair.,The location was excellent. Lots of restaurants and shopping.. Easy access to public transportation.
Courtyard Boston Copley Square,Robert,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 20  2016,9.2,Might seem weird. but we got back from a Sunday night Red Sox game real late.

When the staff was made aware we were given a new room immediately and a discount.,Beds very comfortable. great size rooms. family staff. very easy check in/out and valet.

Courtyard Boston Copley Square,MalenaNJ,United States of America,8 Reviews,March 28  2016,9.6,Parking is expensive (as it seems to be in Copley square) and adjacent lot was full. Had to walk a few blocks with heavy luggage but would do it again because the hotel was lovely!,EVERYTHING was fantastic especially compared to the hotel I stayed at the previous night for a higher price literally a block away. Could have been a city away with the differences from Trinity place to this location on Exeter. The room is spacious and clean with a comfortable bed. The bathroom is HUGE and modern with flat screen tvs in the rooms. The armoire provided a bathrobe for guest use while staying with the option to purchase if you fell in love with it ğŸ˜„ Reception is polite and friendly and genuinely seem to enjoy working for the Marriott.

Courtyard Boston Copley Square,Hadia,Egypt,5 Reviews,November 22  2015,7.9,I know Boston is expensive and this is the most expensive area of Boston but I found the hotel to be very overpriced. It was a very clean and comfortable room with a great bed and great linens and the hotel put me within walking distance of everywhere I needed to go but there was no lobby. no restaurant. no attractive place to sit or have breakfast in the hotel other than a Starbucks. Basically I paid luxury hotel prices but this was not a luxury hotel by any stretch of the imagination. Also the bathrooms were super clean but unattractive. they need updating. They were very 1980's looking with a very small countertop. not enough space for toiletries and bad lighting.,The central location. the friendly and accommodating staff and the level of cleanliness.
Courtyard Boston Copley Square,Teresa,Canada,1 review,November 8  2015,2.5,I wasn't able to travel due to an emergency and the hotel was unable or unwilling to work anything out with me due to their booking policies. I'll never use either hotel or service again.,N/A
Courtyard Boston Copley Square,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,November 4  2015,7.9,They lock the door on Saturday nights for safety reasons.  The man working the front desk grabbed my hotel key out of my hand to verify that I was staying there. He was interrogating me like I was some sort of criminal. The site also mentioned that there was a refrigerator in the room. There was a cabinet for the refrigerator but nothing was in there.,Valet and woman who checked us in were super sweet. Great location! Bed was super comfy and shower was large.

Mandarin Oriental Boston,Paul,Hong Kong,10 Reviews,August 1  2017,7.5,It is difficutl to fathom a 5 star property charging for internet access bearing in mind the room rate.,Excellent and efficient service.  The night manager was particularly helpful with early hours transportation to the airport.
Mandarin Oriental Boston,Mother,United States of America,1 review,July 19  2017,10,I am not a fan of the high-tech lighting system in the bedroom as I couldn't turn off the lights to go to sleep.  The nightstand lights wouldn't switch off using the system on the wall.  I called reception and someone came immediately but I had already found what I assume are the back-up dimmer switches installed on the back of them.  The system in the swank bathroom worked fine.,The staff was incredibly kind and efficient.  Room was quiet.  Breakfast in our room was on time and absolutely delicious.  Perfect egg whites omelettes.  V good coffee.  My husband loved the steam room in the spa. We will stay there again.
Mandarin Oriental Boston,Jeanne,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 13  2017,7.5,Attached Bar Boulud was very mediocre. had nothing to do with Daniel Boulud"s talent. Soggy. tasteless croque monsiuer and really awful. fishy tasting side of spinach.There's nothing better than a good croque monsiuer and I'm sure Daniel Boulud would have been horrified by what I was served. Like a scene from "Kitchen Nightmares".,I liked the bathroom.  was spacious. Loved the access to shopping from the hotel.
Mandarin Oriental Boston,Anonymous,Bermuda,4 Reviews,January 26  2017,5.8,For such an expensive hotel. shocked to find the shower was terrible - a mere trickle.

Mandarin Oriental Boston,Judie,United States of America,1 review,December 30  2016,10,While the hotel was. in our opinion. worth the money. it may be tough to justify almost $1000 per night when staying for an extended period of time.,Absolutely gorgeous hotel. extremely convenient location.

Mandarin Oriental Boston,Cathy,United States of America,10 Reviews,September 2  2016,9.6,Restaurant was limited.  We are there one night but found it difficult to find something we wanted.

That rarely happens!The staff of Bar Bouloud made me feel very cared for. again. traveling on business without my husband and craving privacy. I felt comfortable and never awkward.

I booked this for my parents and on the last day they checked out ahead of time. leaving the keys at the office on the property. In the afternoon I start getting calls from someone in the management team complaining that the door was locked and claiming my parents were still inside - even after I repeatedly explained they had left the door unlocked at checked out hours before and that they were already at the airport since noon. They charged me an extra 75 USD for that and threatened to charge an extra night. What upset me was the immediate accusation. charge and mostly the refusal to believe what I was saying - basically calling me. their client. a liar.,N/A

Evolve Suites Back Bay,Carol,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,May 17  2017,7.1,The fabric of the apartment has been neglected and was very disappointing. Quality of bed linen was poor. Added to which the sheets and pillow cases had not been ironed. Toilet seat was scratched and broke. One TV remote control handset had a broken button. Walls around apartment were scuffed. particularly. in dining area. Dining table had two large damage marks. Not worthy of full price rental fee.,Well designed apartment and great location.

Evolve Suites Back Bay,Leoni,Australia,21 Reviews,April 27  2017,7.9,We were on the ground floor and I did not feel like it was private enough. Try to book an apartment at a higher level. Okay for an overnight stay.,The apartment is near the iconic Fenway Park and a few minutes walk to the T. There are a few stores around Marshalls. Star Market. Sephora. You can hop on the T and be in the heart of shopping in a few minutes. The apartment was spacious and the apartment is new with sparkling appliances. Even the kitchen mittens still had tags on them. The bathrooms were huge and the shower had good water pressure. The beds were comfortable and generally everyone had a good nights sleep.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Clare,United States of America,1 review,April 11  2017,8.8,Getting the key from the lock box was a pain. some detailed instructions in the welcome info would be helpful. Also. when I arrived the apartment door was unlocked and the TV was on. leading to myself being freaked out that someone else was in the apartment.,Very clean. good amount of space. had amenities such as oven. microwave. dishwasher and washing machine (which I didn't use but great to have the option). The apartment complex is lovely and is very close  to the Back Bay train station.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Graham,United Kingdom,21 Reviews,April 5  2017,8.8,Communication prior to arrival. The invoice I got was incorrect. but fairly quickly amended. and it wasn't clear which block the apartment was in or where I should leave the keys on my exit.,- The location was amazing - 5 minutes walk from the Prudential Centre- The apartment was well maintained. clean. comfortable and larger than any hotel room you'd get for the same money - I'm almost hesitant to write too much in case it gets booked for when we next visit!

Evolve Suites Back Bay,Anonymous,Canada,1 review,January 4  2017,9.2,There really wasn't much to complain about! The only down to the stay was that there was no parking included- the price estimate we were given for a spot on site (though there were none left when we arrived) would have cost us an extra $92 american... we ended up paying that for an underground spot near by (this was the best price we could find). The only other complaint I have was that our only wine bottle opener in the room was broken so we had to run to the corner store for another one!,The door man did an amazing job at answering questions and making us feel welcome! The location was excellent and the apartment was great over all!
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Jessica,United States of America,1 review,December 30  2016,3.8,There was no staff ever the two days I was there I called multiple numbers throughout the appartment and no one would answer. bad service,The appartment itself was nice but the over all getting in and getting the keys to the place was a huge problem.

Evolve Suites Back Bay,Sokhom,United States of America,1 review,October 27  2016,7.9,When we got there. our key did not work. Another couple helped us locate a secondary entrance into our unit. Instructions were not communicated clearly and units were not identified on the buildings. Overall we spent almost 30 min trying to locate our unit.,The place and view was beautiful. The malls were right there. We didn't get to use the rooftop deck but we checked it out and can't wait to go back another time.

I happened to telephone immediatelyto ask for further clarification about the room and never got a responsefrom the phone number associated with this accommodation. There was noconcierge when we arrived; the lobby was locked; there was no emergencycontact number inside the lobby or on our contact sheet; the key was ina lock box at a different address (nearby); there was no detailedinformation to find our room. We were saved by a resident in theapartment building who brought tools &amp; cut into our lock box once wedid find the one with my name on it. and then walked through fivedifferent buildings in the complex until we found our room!!

Evolve Suites Back Bay,Vanessa,United States of America,1 review,October 10  2016,10,Getting into the building was a little confusing but luckily there was a woman who worked for the Garrison Apts who helped us.,The apartment was extremely clean and comfortable. We felt like we were right at home.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Melissa,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 9  2016,6.3,Could not ever communicate verbally with management. Parking was difficult- we weren't sure whether the facility parking was available- it was. but it required getting a money order to pay- not convenient at all. We found our own self-pay garage finally. The apartment was difficult to find- there were no numbers above each building. We saw other people trying to find their furnished suite while we were looking for ours.,Comfortable beds. Supplies were a little sparse but that was communicated in the information about the facility. Having an apartment rather than a hotel room was good.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 5  2016,2.5,The apartment was absolutely filthy.  Gnats were flying everywhere. the place hadn't been cleaned at all stains. dust. etc were all over.  Bathroom was disgusting with hairs all over the tub.  The toilet handle fell off.  The elevators were through the parking garage which we had to get a code for.  The rental company was a joke.  They gave us the apartment number so people thought we were trying to break in.,Only the location was decent.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Sebastien,France,7 Reviews,September 29  2016,6.3,It's difficult to get in (we have to ask a neighbor)The staff is hard to reach. and nobody answer after 6pm. (They are not on site)They send the information the night before the arrival. which is not convenient when you arriving from abroad without permanent internet connection.The information sent are not precised enough. or clear enough for a not native speaker.You hear the train.,The place is lovely.Its a real flatIt's pretty central
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Diane,United States of America,25 Reviews,September 28  2016,9.6,It was awesome!,This was an excellent place to stay right in the heart of downtown Boston--Back Bay area.  Everything was as clean as if we were the first people to stay in the apartment.  We would love to come back next year.  We found a parking garage a block away that was $12/day on the weekend--you really can't beat that.  Excellent in every way.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Kathy,United States of America,1 review,September 27  2016,10,Parking situation was not disclosed prior to the visit.  You needed to provide a $40 check or money order to secure parking.  No hair dryer in the facility. Checkout process confusing. Leave the keys where?,Great location and property.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Theresa,United States of America,1 review,September 27  2016,10,The cooking utensils should be upgraded and there needs to be a frying pan.

Evolve Suites Back Bay,Lisa,Australia,5 Reviews,September 20  2016,6.3,Very noisy and did not have all that was listed on inclusions.  . Washing machine but no comp. Washing powder. Ok if you stay a week you can go and buy these things but annoying that we had to even buy toilet paper as we had 4 adults sharing 1 roll for two nights!  Check in was a nightmare . We waited over an hour . made 4 phone calls . each with a promise to call back . only 1 did. He then asked me if i was sure that was my last name repeatedly !! Sent an enquiry about wifi and was sent a very blunt terse reply that it was not a hotel. ! Customer service very lacking!  Would only book again if i was staying longer. Very very expensive for what it is.,Spacious and modern and close to things .
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Jerome,United States of America,1 review,August 7  2016,8.8,It was not appreciated that credit cards or cash were not accepted to pay for parking.  I had to trek 2 blocks out of my way to secure a money order. since I don't carry a checkbook.  If this is necessary. it should be explained up front.  I would suggest adding parking as an option to be paid for at the same time the apartment is booked.  It's just not good customer service.,Apartment was welcoming. accommodating. in a nice area of town and parking was available.  It was within walking distance of Fenway Park. One night availability was a real plus. Also enjoyed the courtyard
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Anonymous,Indonesia,1 review,July 7  2016,6.3,We didnt get the key of the apt in the lockbox left at the side. We called the office several times and they promised to deliver the keys to us but until we checked out. we never received it. Good thing that the site office lady and the concierge is kind enough to help open the apt door and make a spare key.,Good location
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Bridget,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,July 5  2016,5.8,I was asked to provide an indication of the one hour window during which we were likely to arrive. We arrived bang in the middle of this and the manager/caretaker had left with the keys. When he eventually showed up. he could only provide one set of keys (there were 4 of us in a 2 bedroom apartment). Finally. I think it's fair to say the apartment had seen better days (we had to tighten the screws of the door lock which was about to detach from the door; carpets were stained; etc). So whilst the location is good. overall it didn't feel like a great experience. nor a value for money one. There are plenty of other options available - I'd seek them out!,The location is very good
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Darren,Canada,1 review,July 4  2016,9.6,Check in was poor. thankfully a nice woman in the rental office...not associated with the unit rental. was able to assist...was a bit problematicc as only there for 24 hrs and we were late for our concert due to check in!,Liked the patio and roof top patio as well location
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Jules,Canada,6 Reviews,June 28  2016,7.1,It was extremely difficult to find. the complex has 4 buildings and none were clearly marked. It involved me having to go into each one to find the apartment - a map included in the reservation would be very helpful. Also. we needed to arrange parking and had to get a money order (on a Saturday!) - that resulted in some frustration.,Great location. nice. well kept apartment. Would definitely stay again - it was perfect for myself and my parents.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Y,United States of America,1 review,June 22  2016,7.1,There was some confusion at the check-in. The key wasn't at the desk for my guests. and the building manager had to come in at night and open the apartment for them. where it turns out. the cleaning crew had actually left the key. It was some unnecessary stress after a long journey.,The apartment was clean. nicely furnished. well-located with a great view. It was comfortable for 4 adults.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Orjola,Italy,16 Reviews,June 21  2016,6.7,When I booked the apartment. I was told that I would have found the keys at the entrance with my name on the box. I wasn't able to find anything with my name upon arrival and even though I tried to call several times. I had to wait for over 45 minutes until someone opened the door. When I got into the apartment. I realized that they had prepared the apartment for the guest coming the day after. while skipping my reservation. At the entrance of the building there was the key box with the name of the next guest and in the apartment I found the welcome envelope on the table with the same name. After traveling all day. waiting for quite an hour before entering the apartment wasn't nice. I had also specified my time of arrival at the time of booking.,The apartment was nice and the location was good.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Anonymous,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,June 9  2016,3.8,Everything about it.,This place was advertised as a suite. The photos on booking.com are very impressive but when you actually get to the place it is not a suite it is someone's apartment. Clean but basis and definitely not a suite. We we highly disappointed to the point we complained to booking.com only to find out from the customer service guy I spoke to that anyone can advertise anything on booking .com. He told  me that booking .com don't even view the places they put on their website. Very scary really as now I will only book renowned hotels after my experience.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Louise,Canada,1 review,May 6  2016,10,We arrive in the middle of the night. It was hard to find our appartment. Perhaps a bit more direction for within the facilities would havr help.,The location was very practical. The appartment were very clean and comfortable. The 24 hour call services was useful at 2 a.m when we arrive and couldn't find our appartment.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Leigh,United States of America,2 Reviews,March 26  2016,10,We couldn't figure out the tv in the two bedrooms. but the tv in the living room was fine.,The location was great! Easy walking distance to everything. The apartment was clean. spacious. and very safe. Would ABSOLUTELY stay there again!
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Stefania,Argentina,2 Reviews,March 25  2016,9.6,I didn't get the email with the code to get the keys. The concierge had to call to get it.,Apartment was very large. clean. comfortable - excellent!! Very close to subway entrance.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,March 19  2016,9.6,The apartment was freezing at all time. even set the temperature at max.,Very good location. about 5 minutes walk to subway station. Price is affordable.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Jennifer,United States of America,6 Reviews,March 15  2016,4.2,* False advertising for the 2 bedroom apartment. Maybe we got an unlucky unit. but our apartment had 1 bedroom with a queen and 1 bedroom with a twin bed. This was problematic for us. as we were traveling with 2 couples. They said the pull-out couch in the living room counted as a queen. However the listing clearly listed each bedroom with a queen bed.* There was only one small bathroom (not 2 as listed). It was so small that you had to close the door in order to use the sink. * Our apartment itself was in so-so condition. It's not as nicely maintained as the listed pictures show. The room with the twin bed had large black stains on the carpet. The kitchen has utensils and dinner ware. so okay if you're ordering pizza in. However it wasn't equipped for real cooking. There were oddly opened tea bags. no sponges for washing dishes. no cooking spices. etc as you usually get at an Airbnb. * Early check-in (before 4pm) is an additional $75* There are no concierge services as far as we can tell. We tried calling when we realized there was only one queen bed. and when we wanted to ask about luggage storage.  I tried called Northeast Suites who managed the property during our stay. and couldn't get a hold of them. I called again after we returned home. and she just said the pull-out couch in the living room counts as a queen bed.,Location was great for seeing Boston. It was nice having spared space since we were traveling with another couple. Although I'd check out other apartment options on booking.com or airbnb.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Karl,Philippines,1 review,March 8  2016,8.8,The internet did not worked on the first day and I had to investigate only to find out that there was no power to the main router. Everything was fixed after that. Other than this small incident. I think the place was perfect for me.,The kitchen was perfect if you wanted to cook. 7 minute walk to the Hynes Convention Center passing through the overhead passageway located one block away in front of Marriott hotel. subway is just around the corner with a 6 stop direct ride to Chinatown and Quincy market place which is a must tourist destination. 10 minute walk to Boylston street where most of the shopping is located.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Stephen,Australia,8 Reviews,March 8  2016,9.2,There was nothing bad I could say about this.

I had plenty of space the facilities were great and the bed was super comfy not to mention a great location
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Jessica,United States of America,1 review,March 3  2016,9.2,When the man from garage opened the lock box there was only one set of keys. it stated on the instructions that 2 sets came with the 2 bed rm. I called the contact person who was listed on the instructions but never heard back. I wanted to let them know so that I wouldn't be charged for losing keys I never had. Also the parking garage men had given 3 different prices.1 said 20.00 per night. another said 45.00 we ended up paying 40.00 though I'm not complaining about the price it just was disappointin going from 20.00 to 45.00 then 40.00. Though this was minor issues for me.,The room far exceeded my expectations.very clean. roomy. Arrival was smooth . a man who worked for the garage which was conveniently located directly under the apartment helped direct us to the parking and showed us to the gate that had the lock box with our keys as well as helping us to the room.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Elizabeth,United States of America,1 review,February 29  2016,9.2,Needed help to open lockbox for keys; later locked ourselves out of the apartment because we had been given the wrong keys.Apartment lighting is terrible,Clean. attractive. excellent location near Pru Center and the T.  Concierge very helpful. kitchen well stocked with basic equipment.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Amber,United States of America,2 Reviews,February 27  2016,8.8,a few drafts by the windows and a few noisy neighbors but other than that a great stay.,great location and parking right under the building was very convenient. the parking was an extra $40 a night paid by check or money order only but worth it since it's hard to find parking. close to all the museums and attractions. walking distance to stores and food market which made getting dinner to make very easy. the kitchen was great and fully furnished with new appliances.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Bassem,Lebanon,2 Reviews,February 20  2016,7.1,The Picture in the reservation photo at booking.com wasn't the same. the rooms were smaller and the second bed room was too small. the dinner table wasn't as in photos! Big confusion at checking in as the given code incorrect wich led to many calls to resolve the issue,Location and price
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Regina,United States of America,1 review,February 18  2016,6.7,The staff was hard to reach. I don't think I actually spoke to anyone in person. The whole process from start to getting into the hotel was unclear and a very. very frustrating experience. Booking.com was not clear for the 4 weeks leading up to it. No one was helpful over the phone. and I was sent to the wrong hotel. They didn't know what was going on. and get any information took far longer than it should have. It's sad because I really liked the place but I don't think I'd do it again because of the experience leading up to it. The man on the phone was rude as well. which mad it even harder to keep my cool. Overall the leading up to was not good at all.,The place was really nice. the apartment feel for the price was great. The summer would be cool with the balcony it had. but really liked how it had a full kitchen and microwave.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Bill,China,1 review,February 12  2016,9.6,Car parking is a big problem here in downtown Boston. It cost me extra $90 for parking my car in garage nearby (15min by walking. believe the cheapest).,The apartment and the real estate is new and in perfect conditions. Everything is perfect for staying. And the location is perfect for going anyway in downtown Boston.The sitting room is large and equipped with big sofas and dinner table. Kitchen has everything needed for cooking and dinner. It's well maintained. Bedrooms are clean and comfortable. Bathroom is clean too.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Niu,China,11 Reviews,February 11  2016,7.9,There was no staff on site.   They gave me an email check in instruction. and that's a bit confusing. especially for a foreigner.    It took me 40 minutes    to get into the right building and into my room.,Excellent location.  Two bedrooms for the price of one compared to nearby hotels. and one living room. one kitchen for free.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Hang,United States of America,1 review,February 10  2016,7.9,Check-in: wrong combination was given for the key lock box; only one pair of keys was given instead of two as promised. and staff cannot find a second pair for us. Check-out: we were out for a short walk and returned 10 minutes before the standard check-out time (11am). and found that the cleaning staff was already inside the apartment and had all our luggages badly packed lying outside the front door (we locked the door when we left). She threw our food on table (wrapped sandwiches. fruits. etc.) to trash. And because of the mess we ended up forgetting to take our phone chargers on wall.,Spacious. clean. good location. and overall great value for the money.
Evolve Suites Back Bay,Suzanne,Thailand,2 Reviews,January 18  2016,8.8,coordination to pick up key was lacking. we were in the freezing cold with two small children and the lock box with our name on it had the wrong combination on it! so we had to wait for someone to call us back and finally had to break open the box to get in. also didn't like that the names of guests are clearly written on the lock boxes for anyone to see. perhaps better to give a code name or word instead of compromising privacy.,fantastic location in copley square. good-sized 2 bedroom apartment with kitchen and laundry facilities for price of a small hotel room. cannot beat the value or location. especially if traveling with children. and there is a zipcar station right downstairs. seriously convenient! i would return to this property.  rooms were fine. not fantastic and bathroom and kitchen were quite small but really cannot complain for the price.

Encore Bed and Breakfast,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,October 30  2017,7.1,The tiny breakfast area consisted of 1 table which seated 4 people. We had to say what time we would have our breakfast and make sure we finished before other guests arrived. We shared the table with 2 other guests - it was very cosy indeed. David stage managed the breakfast and if you put anything down on the table in the wrong place he moved it back. There was no mirror in the bedroom so if your partner is busy in the bathroom you can't do your hair or make up. There was no tea or coffee making equipment which would have been really nice.There was no soap or shower gel in the bathroom so we had to find a shop late evening to buy our own  - I think a small tablet of soap is not much to ask for. We thought it was very expensive with a lack of home comforts.,The shower room was lovely. The room was nicely furnished. The croissants from the bakery were really good as were the other cakes and buns which you must order the night before. The location was good and the area was nice. Easy walk to the station.
Encore Bed and Breakfast,Oscar,Sweden,17 Reviews,September 28  2017,9.2,The property has no elevator. so for those who have heavy luggage this might be an issue.,Great atmosphere. Excellent breakfast and discussions! Thank you for such kind hosting.
Encore Bed and Breakfast,Tim,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,August 8  2017,8.3,Our breakfast experience of B&amp;B's in England (We stay in Whole house AirBnB. Hotels and Self catering cottages too). is a self service arrangement. We help ourselves to a selection of fruit. yogurt. pastries. juice. Tea or Coffee. where a Continental breakfast is offered. We have not B&amp;B'd before in America. and In Encore B&amp;B. our Continental breakfast was presented as selected on the card the night before. It was nicely presented. and we sat in a small area with a table and chairs talking with David. however the portion was small. we left the table feeling hungry and maybe it was our fault not to have asked for another pastry or another coffee. as it was not offered.,David and Reinhold were very accommodating as we arrived early from New York to their B&amp;B. before check in. and they allowed us to leave our bags for us to spend the whole day exploring Boston including walking the Freedom Trail on our first day. The house is situated in a tree lined street and the houses on each side of the road are substantial and salubrious and within easy walking distance from Back Bay / South End station. about a 15 minute walk. It is well situated. approximately half way between the Isabella Stewart Gardner Palace and Boston Park. both sightseeing must do's. where Boston park is the beginning of the Freedom trail. The same was offered the following day. we were up early and rather than taking our bags around Boston before our evening train to New York. David and Reinhold allowed us to leave these safely in their house during the day. Thank you.The room is spacious. the bed was comfortable. and the house quiet. we were asked to complete our breakfast order selection from a card and to place it outside the room before 10pm for the following morning.We felt after looking at other accommodation prior to booking. it was good value for money. we were stunned at the overnight prices to stay in Back Bay. or South End offered by Hotels and AirBnB. We discovered the prices fluctuated in the Hotels based upon the timing of Conferences in Boston. whereas Encore B&amp;B held their prices stable. David and Reinhold have been offering their B&amp;B for 16 years and they were very pleasant hosts.
Encore Bed and Breakfast,Kevin,France,1 review,July 23  2017,10,nothing,Reinhold and David are super nice guys who try to be comprehensive when you have issue to reach their place (aka flight delay) and make your stay enjoyable.I will definitely come back there the next I am in the Boston's area!
Encore Bed and Breakfast,Lw_l,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,May 5  2017,9.2,I chose this B&amp;B mainly because of its overwhelmingly positive reviews and its location in South End and near Back Bay. It was one of the cheaper options I could find in the area. Saying that. nearly $300 for one person for one night is about twice as much as I would have liked to pay.,The owners of the B&amp;B were very friendly and willing to help with anything I needed. The breakfast was a treat. with plenty of options. and wonderful company in the morning with other lodgers. The bed was extremely comfortable and the cleanliness top-notch.
Encore Bed and Breakfast,Xinran,China,8 Reviews,February 24  2017,8.8,This is the fist time I try a Bnb. it still makes me feel a little bit living in someone's house in the end. In the morning. we were leaving. to airport so we tried to make some quick breakfast by ourselves. the awkward meeting with unseen owner is a bit embarrassed. I don't know why. but it made me realized that I am still a stranger here.,As a foreigner. and a stranger. and a curious tourists you can pretend to live in a decent Boston family at here. Nice and quiet neighborhood. with lovely bistros. grocery shop. cafe and liquor shops nearby. And. cute dogs. The host wasn't show up when checking in. instead of leaving a letter on the door to me. which reminds me the old school days. Johnny is nicely kind hearted. (You know we are reserved Asians) he makes wonderful breakfast. Croissants here are brilliant. must try. The bath things is first-class. towels are soft and clean. bed is in perfect balance of hardness and softness.

Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 23  2017,7.1,The lobby and overall aesthetic of the property were outstanding. however the room left much to be desired. The furnishings are old. marred. and not as lavish as expected for the hotelâ€™s reputation and price tag. A door was missing from our tv curio and there was one chair in the room. The location is so incredible it almost makes up for the rooms lack of charm.,The location was incredible.
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Peter,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,October 22  2017,5.8,We booked a standard double room but were a given what was a single room with a standard double bed. One side of the bed was next to the wall with  space for only 1 bedside table. could only get out of the bed from one side.,Good location for Boston Common and Freedom Trail and activities located on Long Wharf. Wide range of places to eat nearby from expensive to inexpensive such as Pret which is good for breakfast.

Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,October 19  2017,6.3,Had 2 very expensive cappuccinos in the bar 7 dollars each and disgusting. Just black coffee with frothy cream on the top. it was as though they made their own version  on the spot. The bed was a standard size and far too small for us. and we are both small people. The head board was way bigger than the bed. very uncomfortable. The parking is so expensive. I would check into a hotel a little way out with a bigger room. and less expensive parking next time.,The hotel is very clean. And I liked the eco friendly options available. Staff are all very friendly and professional.
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Melissa,United States of America,1 review,October 18  2017,8.3,There was no refrigerator in the room.  There was also no fan in the bathroom.  The room was dark with not a lot of light- even though we turned on all of the lights.My Mom. who I was traveling with has trouble with steps.  The main hotel entrance has 6 steps up to the lobby.  There is no suitcase ramp or ability to carry the bags up or down.  We watched a lot of people drag their bags upstairs or pull them down. which was not easy on anyone.  Another thing to note is that there is no restroom on the main floor.  The bathrooms are located up two very large staircases that have no elevator access.  I understand this is an older hotel but a ramp to walk up/down or carry bags up/down should be put in.  And is it really difficult to put in one bathroom on the main level?,Nice Staff.
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 18  2017,4.6,...The bell service in the lobby laughing about how much they made in tips. and publicly counting their tips.  Observed this on three separate occasions. The first room they put us in was so small you couldn't move within the room. The bathroom door hit the toilet when entering the bathroom. We asked for a different room and they did accommodate our request. Why did they put us in this room to begin with???  Seemed like the LAST room you would put a guest in. We were charged for WiFi even though we were told it was free (despite filling out the required loyalty card). We were quoted a $25 price for an added cot. but we were charged $30. The shower had terrible water pressure. The faucets were loose.,The lobby looked nice. The second room they gave us was satisfactory.
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,William,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 18  2017,8.3,The staff in the breakfast restaurant were ok but not exactly bubbling with enthusiasm. They could do with a course in good old American friendliness. Room for a deluxe was certainly on the small side.,Comfort of bed is always number 1 with me and this bed was perfect ! Location is pretty good though a tad far from some of the main sites .

Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Songbird816,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 17  2017,10,Single rooms tend to be at the ends of halls. and often a longer walk from the elevator.  I was OK with that.  There were a couple of stairs to negotiate in the hall. with the bag.  But I did OK.,I love historic. old hotels. and had never stayed at the Parker House.  This was my chance. and I especially liked the fact that the hotel has some single rooms. that are cheaper than a standard double room.  The historic area is wonderful. and the hotel is right next to King's Chappel.  I took a shuttle to the train. and got off at Government Center.  I walked to the hotel - about a block.  SUPER location!!!  Wonderful old-world elegance!
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 17  2017,10,Room was a little small but we weren't in it much anyway.,Service was excellent throughout the hotel.  Very comfortable bed and bath. Terrific location. The hotel is known for their rolls and their Boston Cream Pies. They delivered 2 of the pies to our room upon arrival!  Classy!
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Pete,United States of America,1 review,October 17  2017,7.5,We booked a queen deluxe room and it was the smallest room I think I have ever had.  It was also in a deep corner of the hotel and oddly shaped which made it difficult to get to and difficult to move around each other.  I realize this is an historic hotel. but these corner rooms are not good.  I thought the price was a bit out of line considering the small room and the long walk from the elevators.  The street noise was a bit unnerving as well. but it is downtown just a block from the Boston Common. so noise is going to be a factor.  We got used to most of it by the second night with the exception of the periodic police or fire sirens.,Though a bit pricey. the food in the restaurant and the Parker Bar was totally awesome (wicked!). The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Room cleanliness was superb.  All facets of the hotel including the location was perfect except for two things...
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Lisa,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 15  2017,9.6,I asked for someone to come to my room to get my luggage this morning.  No one showed up. and I got a much later start this morning than I would have liked.,Very helpful and friendly staff.  Appreciated the historical value of the property.  Comfortable rooms.
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Clement,South Africa,4 Reviews,October 13  2017,9.2,N/A,The experience at the Hotel was seamless and hassle free. The team at breakfast were able to cater for special requirements and it was done effortless. The lady responsible for cleaning the rooms were one of the most friendly people I have come across. always a smile and a friendly word of greeting.
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Lester,Canada,1 review,October 12  2017,9.6,The safe did not work and the air conditioning was not working well. The shower was tiny but fine. The only part that we did not like was that the bed ( room 368) was just too tiny for two people.,The selection of fruit at breakfast was good. the coffee excellent and the selection of meat ( Baccon. Sausages etc) were good. There was a good choice of cereals. breads and muffins. Staff were nice.
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 12  2017,4.2,We were aware that the hotel was old and appeared to be both historic and charming. Howevery the age of the hotel should NEVER be a reason to let the standards drop. This hotel really needs some investment to ensure that the bathroomsame are improved whilst retaining it's charm. There is absolutely  no  excuse badly marked baths. filthy grout and VERY rusty shelving.This was the reason why we asked for an alternative room. However. the room we were given where the bathroom was in a better condition although still sub standard was situated above the air conditioning/ air vent units which rattled and vibrated throughout the entire night.it was so noisy that we actually thought that there was overnight demolition going on. Once again we had to request a change of room. Three rooms in a four day stay was very unsettling. However. after my written complaint by email the management decided to give us one of the evenings on a complimentary basis. Which was appreciated. Overall however this stay was disappointing as our expectations of the standard was unfulfilled.  We had expected to spend a relaxing time in Boston after a hectic 7 days in New York where we had stayed in a 3 star rated Hilton Hotel which was of a higher standard and so much better value for money than this 4 star rated hotel in Boston. The old adage of "you only get what you pay for"did not apply in this instance. It is lovely to stay in a place with great historical interest and coming from Scotland we have many great establishments like this but it is so important that standards of cleanliness and general maintenance  is maintained and indeed brought into the 21st century.,The receptionists and duty manager were helpful and did what they could to deal with our complaints. The concierge staff and all the porters were very helpful and pleasant.
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Margaret,United States of America,1 review,October 12  2017,8.8,I thought that the housekeeping could have been more thorough.  The bathroom was cleaned well but the carpet vacuuming "missed a spot" or two.,The concierge was wonderful.  Following a phone call before we even left home. we received names of places to eat.  When there they were terrific in booking restaurants and helped us with maps and tour ideas.
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,LittlePrince1977,United States of America,4 Reviews,October 10  2017,8.8,CONS:-They charge for EVERYTHINGâ€”the â€œBusiness Centerâ€� computer and printer: to use it to log in then access my e-mail (less than two minutes) and to print two pages= 6usd. Prior week I was at â€œThe Fairfax at Embassy Rowâ€� in DC- they gave free use of internet computer and printing (same level as this hotel) PLUS I wasnâ€™t warned by the concierge. Greg. of the cost when I asked where to find the â€œBusiness Centerâ€�. Only after you give your credit card do you know the final charges. -Too expensive a restaurant in the hotelâ€”LOTS of local eateries near-by (many price ranges). SO DO NOT WASTE MONEY HERE. Even a Starbucks and a 7-11 within 2 min. walkâ€¦lots of other restaurants for many tastes within two blocksâ€”better bang for your buck from high to low price. DETAILS:-Sign up for their â€œguest rewardâ€� program and save 12/day on the cost of the Wifi. â€”It should have been included. I hate these â€œresort feesâ€� and â€œif you want wifiâ€”sign upâ€�-Turned on the heater (a cold snap in Sept) and the fired up dust made the fire alarm go off. Poor housekeeping/cleaning apparently.,Overall I'd give you a strong "B+" rating--reasons stated below.PROS:LOCATION. LOCATION. LOCATION (easy walk to three T-stationsâ€”straight shot on the Blue line to the airport on the T or South Station Amtrak. easy with luggage â€”donâ€™t wast money on a taxi â€”there is a shuttle at the airport T-station. I lived in Boston in 1990â€¦.visited a lot sinceâ€¦brought my folks here in â€™93 and sister in â€™17. I love Boston.HISTORY.â€”This Hotel: Great service and high-qualityâ€¦This is near it ALL and walkable. Freedom Trail.-I was in a petit single (less expensive)â€¦good for ONLY ONE (as it was meant)â€”well apportioned (meaning they use the small space well). great economy of the space.GREAT in many ways but needing some upgrades:-There was a small triangle corner built-in (I mean SMALL-but it worked for me) for my computer with a chair (great use of space)-Electrical outlets not easy to get atâ€”an easy fix if the lamps had outlets like ALL other hotels these daysâ€¦NO outlets on the lamps as is now the fashion in ALL low-to-mid-to-high end hotels.-There was an ice bucket (the free ice machine was on my floorâ€”easy to get to).  No frig or microwave (the ads say â€œmini-barâ€� NOT SOâ€”ALL have been removed).-Free coffee and maker in the room (in Yokohama Japan my high end hotel charged 6usd to make drip coffee per cup in my room) so this is a plus.-Instead of a brick wall my window looked out at the wonderful stained glass of the church next door. Not a view but I liked it plus it was private.-The bed and pillows were so wonderful and comfortableâ€”great quality.-Heavy doors to block outside noise and in-room safe.-Wonderful A/Câ€”quiet and cold.
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Deborah,United Kingdom,13 Reviews,October 8  2017,4.6,Worst double room I have ever had. How it could be rated as a double I have no idea. One had to walk sideways to get past the end of the bed. Terrible lighting. so husband unable to read in bed.Window painted out with black paint. where air condition unit was inserted . so no way you could look out. It was very noisy.Receptionist very curt.and didn't ask for name but immediately demanded a credit card...it sort of sums it up. Overpriced and trading on past glory. Would never stay again.,Toiletries reasonable
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Robert,United Kingdom,1 review,October 6  2017,7.1,Tiny room - tiny bed (barely a double) - poor shower -  bedside table and light on one side only. Cost $500 + per night - very poor value for money.,Good staff and good position

Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Dire,United Kingdom,1 review,October 2  2017,3.8,The room allocated reeked of cigarette smoke. was small and at the furthest point from the lift and  I had emailed the hotel to tell them I was partially disabled !!!The Staff on reception were very surly. but after complaining and staggering the length of the corridor on crutches they found a better room. I would never stay there again,The luggage porter who kept saying how sorry he was for the way we had been treated.
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Alex,United States of America,13 Reviews,October 1  2017,8.8,bathroom to small,This hotel is stately and classic full of great architectural details and wonderful lobby . Typical of hotels in Boston or NYC rooms are small bathroom is small and a large bed is a full so its a snug fit but well appointed rooms. The Restaurant serves great breakfast buffet don't miss it . the two pubs are lively and full of nice people several feedings and receptions were going on at the place. Walking distance to Faneuil Hall and the port of Boston where you can go on boat rides and many restaurants. A Walgreens open 24/7 is half a block up and many shops within a few blocks  on the historic Paul Revere trail ( freedom trail) across the street a wonderful historic building turned into a Steak house very romantic. This location in downtown area where people are outside walking all the time ...don't miss it .
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Isabella,United Kingdom,1 review,September 28  2017,5.8,The room was very small. and so was the bed. The bathroom was quite old (not that bad though). It was just quite expensive for what you got. and the worst part of it was that you had to pay to get Wi-Fi in the room. which was something stupid like $11/day. We were travelling back to the U.K. so we had to check in to our flights from the lobby which was just annoying. And when you pay that much you expect things like that included.,All of the communal areas were beautiful. Lots of nice and helpful staff. It's also in a great location. but the rooms aren't noisy which is a plus
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Elizabeth,Canada,3 Reviews,September 27  2017,7.5,Small rooms. not much room at all in the bathroom.,We liked the location - able to walk to many different areas.  Impressive history of the hotel.   comfortable beds.
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Sandra,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,September 26  2017,10,The view from the window looked into another hotel/apartments. the only covering for the window was a heavy blackout blind making it dark as the blind had to be down when in the room for privacy. Otherwise could not fault the room,Location was excellent with lots of bars. cafes &amp; restaurants nearby. 5 minute walk from shops including Macy's. Staff were very helpful and the rooms were clean. functional and comfortable with a proper dressing room to store luggage. Also try the Boston cream pie - absolutely delicious
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Richard,United Kingdom,12 Reviews,September 26  2017,6.3,We know the hotel is historic. but we found that the dÃ©cor in the public areas and in the room were a little dated. The room felt very basic and not very modern. The foyer area felt like the check in area at the airport. The Omni parker is a good hotel. but it isn't one that we would hurry back to. and we are glad it was only a one night stay.,The hotel is situated very close to the centre of Boston. making it easy to get to many of the eateries in the area. Access to the hotel is easy and there is a valet for those who are arriving by car. Our room was very clean and easy to find. The personnel are very helpful and friendly.
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Julia,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,September 25  2017,6.3,Shockingly expensive for the size of the room and when we queried this with the Front Desk they were less than concerned and could not give us the rack rate to make a comparison with our cost for the night.Very impersonal and expensive.,Location
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Julie,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 25  2017,7.5,Upon checking out. we told front desk we wanted to split the bill and were advised that about 80% had already been charged to my card a couple days before.  Apparently this is done whenever the charges reach $1.500.  I said I wasn't told about this upon checkin or would have offered to pay half the bill.  She said they always call the room and leave a VM. however. I did not receive a VM.  I asked for a credit and then to split the bill in half but they could not do that because a credit would take 3 days to show up on my account.  It finally got worked out but this is a practice that should be told to the guests upon arrival so there are no surprises.,Starbucks in gift shop was good. very convenient and the staff was overly friendly and helpful.  Concierge desk excellent. gave excellent restaurant recommendations. offered to make reservations. and gave detailed directions to various locations.  Maid was the friendliest I've ever had.  She engaged us. always wished us a nice day. was always nearby and ready to clean our room. etc.

Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Beth,United States of America,4 Reviews,September 7  2017,7.5,Noisy outside from 3:00 am on. Bed wasn't comfortable. Coffee pot didn't work properly. bathroom exhaust fan didn't work. The cost for parking was outrageous...$48. Per night! Crazy! We didn't eat a meal at the hotel because there isn't one vegan option on the menu. They need to try harder. and make that available. Avocado Toast for breakfast would be a good start.,Perfect location for all the sites we wanted to see in Boston. The layout of the Executive Room was wonderful for 3 people staying 5 nights. very spacious. The Hotel was lovely! Historic! My son enjoyed his first Boston cream pie! The staff was amazing. Loved the Last Hurrah. We look forward to staying here again.
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Helen,Belgium,16 Reviews,September 7  2017,6.7,It was a little faded and in need of a renovation.  It was overpriced.  Be wary of the "three person bedroom."  You only have a king size bed. and you have to pay for the cot if you want the third person in the room.  When I remarked about that during check in. the lady at the front desk told me that three people could sleep on a king -- thanks.  It was a little noisy (walls were thin).  Also. note that the price does not include taxes. but that might be standard for all of the hotels in downtown Boston.,The location was terrific. The bed was comfortable.

Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Fiona,United Kingdom,1 review,September 5  2017,7.5,The room was a little small. and the standard bed was extra small. We expected a double bed as standard but the bed was definitely not a double. Our paperwork advised we would have a minibar in our room. but we couldn't find one.We had a pack of 6 beers on arrival that we had purchased on a trip to a brewery in Toronto and these were taken from us due to a hotel policy and had to collect on our leaving day which was no good as we were leaving for the airport as Boston was the last stop on our trip.,The hotel was lovely and in a good location

We ran the fan and  we didn't hear a thing. slept like babies. Some people have complained about the room size. not sure what they do in their rooms that I am missing out on. rooms are not huge but again not a problem for us.  They were nice. clean and had what was needed.,Location. location. location!  Could not have been easier to get from airport to hotel. which took us about 25 minutes. The history in this hotel is amazing.  stop by the concierge desk and you can pick up information about the hotel as well as ghost sightings within the hotel. There are some very interesting people who have stayed here throughout history.  We had dinner at the Parker House restaurant at table 40. where JFK proposed.  The salmon was like butter and the Boston cream pie. which originated here was wonderful.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The beds were very comfortable and we had everything we needed and bathrooms were clean as well.

Boston Omni Parker House Hotel,Keona,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 9  2017,9.2,The ONLY complaint was the room size. The pictures did not do it justice. and the bed is too small for a two-person deal. My friend and I made it work. but sometimes we were very uncomfortable because of how little our space was.,Great location. especially for those who love to walk around. The staff was very accommodating. and everything was great. I even asked the staff to switch up the payment plan. and they did without hesitation. The staff was very helpful with luggage. and also calling a taxi if you needed it. I loved how once you checked in. they gave you a brochure of recommended locations around the area. and sites to see. We took full advantage of all suggestions. I would highly recommend staying here when visiting Boston! I would definitely come here again.

Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Terrence,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 11  2017,6.7,They have a master light switch.  In the middle of the night when you are half asleep you have to turn that switch on to be able to turn on the bathroom light and when you turn the master switch on it turns the lights on in the rest of the room.  There is no literature in the room about room service or restaurant menus.,N/A
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Gonen,United States of America,5 Reviews,October 8  2017,6.7,The gym is Very anemic. very little equipment and is not adapted to a hotel located in an area without parks where it can be run.,Rooms are fine. clean.

Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Rebecca,United States of America,1 review,October 5  2017,5.8,The staff is incompetent and does not pay attention or listen to the customer. My card was charged a pending charge of $1500.00 for 4 nights limiting my funds when I explicitly asked the clerk to divide it amongst 2 cards. She ignored my request and not until I checked my cards balance did I realize what she did. She only apologized and I had to make several requests to get anyone in management to assist me. I still haven’t heard from the general manager after leaving a voicemail. The same clerk was asked to reserve my party for the airport shuttle and this wasn’t done as well. The staff is Terrible and did not care how much they inconvenienced me or how their imbecilic actions affected my trip/vacation. I will let everyone I know of the poor service received.,Breakfast was good
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 3  2017,3.3,The bed was horrible!  The food choices nearby were very limited.

Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Sandy,Canada,1 review,September 30  2017,9.2,We called the hotel when we arrived at the airport but the shuttle did not arrive.  When I called back. the shuttle had already stopped running (Iater evening) and she told us to take a cab and they would cover it which they did but it was still aggravating.,Rooms were a good size and very comfortable.  Loads of toiletry items. many I've never seen before like facial wipes. it was appreciated.  Good breakfast. 24 hr coffee station. allowed a later check out at no cost

Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Robert,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,September 8  2017,5.0,Regrettably we arrived at this hotel 2.5 hours later than anticipated at 10.30pm  or thereabouts. Our train to Boston was very late. We found that the two rooms I had booked for 3 people (a twin and a single) had been given to other customers. We were offered a room with one double bed but one of us  would have to go to another hotel some miles away. After strong protestations the management brought a a fold-up bed to the room with a double bed. which two people reluctantly had to share. So all three of us shared one room. Despite not being charged. the hotel's practice was appalling.,N/A

Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Laura,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 29  2017,9.6,I didn't like when I ask a question and the front desk clerk. told me it was across the street.  Come to find out it was across the street. but way down the street. not really in walking distance like I had ask. You need to have a bus to take you down the street to the Liquor Store. It is like a 20 minute walk both ways.,The bed was very comfortable. The pillows was nice and soft.  The room was perfect.  The breakfast food was good. had a very nice selection.

Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Jacqueline,Canada,5 Reviews,August 21  2017,9.6,Unfortunately the hotel is located across the street from a Methadone clinic and our view was of the corner of all the heroine addicts and people coming out of the clinic but I do have to say that they clean the street up each night and the hotel has extra security so no one was ever just wandering around.,The room was massive - we had a king room with a sofa bed and there was TONS of space. Clean. conveniently located and the shuttle to Fenway was a great added touch.
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Anna,Hungary,12 Reviews,August 21  2017,7.1,Location practical next to highway. area not so nice.

Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Diane,United States of America,6 Reviews,August 9  2017,7.9,The location. Not only was it not as centrally located as I would have liked. but it did not feel entirely safe to return to in the evening or to wait at a bus stop for an extended length of time. The gym facilities were just adequate.,It was very clean. The staff was very friendly. While the location was far from ideal-there are many city bus lines that service the area and have pick-up and drop-off stops very close by.
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Heather,United States of America,1 review,August 8  2017,4.6,I didn't like that I had to park my car in a public parking garage across the street from the hotel.I didn't like that my room had a small vestibule that needed to be entered with a key then there was my room and one other room behind a locked door.I didn't like that I faced a busy and loud intersection with countless homeless men under my window (and the window didn't lock).I didn't like that I was facing and ER known for stab wound victims.I didn't like the feeling of fear I had in my gut all night.,The price was what originally drew me to book this hotel and other Hampton Inn's in which I have stayed were fine.
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Robin,United States of America,1 review,August 7  2017,6.7,Unfortunately. I have to make mention of the bed bugs.

Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Alyson,United States of America,6 Reviews,August 2  2017,6.7,The location was just awful - homeless people all around. gangs of teens roaming the streets. drug transactions occurring right outside our window.

Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Britney,United States of America,1 review,August 1  2017,5.8,The neighborhood was horrible! From the description it seemed perfect and we planned on walking a lot. Turns out its near 3 half way houses and hospital. At night there were druggies everywhere and would bother us while walking. Ended up spending more on taxi/Uber then being able to enjoy walking. We were literally approached for drugs on the corner in front of the hotel our first day. scared us to death!The shuttle was the only reason we booked this hotel and ended up being unavailable the times we needed it so it cost $40 to go 4 miles from airport to hotel one way. We were on the 3rd floor. could not sleep it was so loud. If you book request to be as far away from the busy intersection as possible!,Having breakfast ready in the morning was awesome so we didn't have to leave.
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Bryan,United States of America,1 review,July 31  2017,5.0,The shower was broke it didn't drain properly I had to take a bath because the shower didn't work it was busted. Not a very good thing had me pretty much upset for the money that I paid wasn't even worth calling staff to fix it or moving my room. I contacted them to try for early check-in and I got responded to the day after I left the property that I could have and check in before 3. It was very annoying and I was very upset to receive the text or the email saying that I could check in early the day I left very disappointed but it was Scenic to where I needed to be going on a cruise,The staff was definitely friendly and courteous to the best of their ability
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Stev,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,July 28  2017,5.4,I would avoid this hotel due to the area.  We later found out that it is known to people living in the Boston area as Methadone Mile. There was a lot of undesirable people hanging around on the streets so would not advise leaving the hotel.,Very comfortable big beds.  Clean room.  Free buffet breakfast okay.  Hotel shuttle bus from airport and to South Bus Station the next morning really helpful.

Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Bruce,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 16  2017,10,There was a group of drug addicts that hung around in an area across the street from the hotel. We were told that there was a clinic nearby that these people came to for help. It was difficult to watch them.,The Hampton Inn &amp; Suites was a lovely facility with very nice staff. Our room had everything in it that we could expect and even a few extra things. It was a reasonable price considering the other prices in Boston.
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 11  2017,7.5,Location is far from train station. In addition. the location is close to a drug rehab facility and my family did not feel safe walking outside of the hotel due to the larger amount of homeless people walking and doing drugs around the area. If you do not mind to uber this is the hotel for you. Great staff. clean facilities. and free airport shuttle.,N/A
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Rebecca,United States of America,1 review,July 9  2017,9.2,The $25 per day parking fee was an unwelcome surprise the day we left. When I received a parking pass (also my room key). I "assumed" parking was included.Sadly I was wrong.,Breakfast was great.Bed was comfortable.Staff were courteous and helpful. In fact one lady at the front desk guided us to the hotel over the phone when we were lost in the city.

Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Robert,South Africa,1 review,July 6  2017,5.4,We were very disappointed with this hotel. where we spent 5 nights. Its location is dodgy. with a homeless shelter &amp; Methadone Clinic across the road - as a result. vagrants &amp; addicts hang around on the streets. so it is not safe to walk around. especially not at night. A friend of mine. who lives in Boston. warned us the day before we arrived &amp; advised us to change hotels. but we were encouraged by our internet download (which appears to now be out of date. but we used it in July 2016 to make the reservation) which stated that there was a shuttle going back &amp; forth into &amp; from downtown. the waterfront &amp; other tourist locations - NOT TRUE!!! Apparently. this service was discontinued - given the location. we wonder why &amp; surely we should have been notified thereof. Even today the website states "free shuttle to airport. hospital &amp; local attractions".The hotel is also a long way from downtown &amp; all the action. Again the website was misleading! It doesn't mention that the hotel is on the outskirts of the city bordering an industrial area. It merely states it is a mile away from downtown.There is a shuttle. but it goes to Logan airport. stopping at South Station and another one that goes to the "hospital" - not sure about that. As a result. we spent a fortune using Uber into &amp; out of the downtown area.Also. our suite had a fridge &amp; microwave. but no plates or anything other than 2 paper cups. The cupboards above the microwave were totally empty. We expected to have a couple of plates and. perhaps. some glasses. The website should say. get some plates to warm your food.There was also no safe in our room - really????The "legendary" complimentary breakfast is ok - if you are ok with paper plates &amp; plastic cutlery.The business Centre does not have a scanning facility - you need to print in the business Centre &amp; then get them to email the document to you.,The room (a suite with a king size bed) was nice &amp; the service from the staff was good. The wifi is good.The 2 restaurants on site (a Cuban &amp; an Asian) were good.
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Amy,United States of America,3 Reviews,June 27  2017,9.6,Location was not ideal. however having car rental across the street was very beneficial.,Perfect for trip to Boston with my family.  Area around the hotel was not much to look at but having the rooms at a more reasonable price than most places in Boston made this a good find.  Easily used Lyft and Uber to move in and out of town.
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Anonymous,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,June 25  2017,3.3,This hotel is well out of the city center. right beside a large medical and trauma center and so there are constant sirens throughout the night. It is too far to walk into the city and difficult to get a taxi-the staff are not at all helpful in trying to help arrange this. They did recommend a 'local' driver who seems to wait around the hotel--charged us an exorbitant rate! The hotel is also surrounded by homeless people and this is frightening. especially at night when large groups gather. There were obvious security guards in the hotel lobby.My husband booked this hotel thinking that the nightly rate was the total price-definitely not worth the money,Breakfast was good but the lobby was cold and had security guards wondering around

Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Elisabeth,United States of America,1 review,June 5  2017,7.1,The hotel is next to a hospital and an area where addicts roam around. so ambulances and police car sirens occur frequently!!

Breakfast was GREAT!
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Michelle,United States of America,1 review,May 25  2017,5.0,The location was awful.  Took forever to get to the hotel from the airport and when we pulled up. there were a bunch of homeless people outside of the property directly across the street.  I did not feel safe at all when it got dark as the crowd got bigger and the pan handlers were migrating into the streets at every red light.  We could not even go for a walk around the area to check things out.  Also this hotel if very close to a busy hospital so there are sirens at all hours of the day/night.,I liked the breakfast.  Lots of choices and constantly stocked thought the morning.  The people working for this hotel where very pleasant.

Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Peter,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,April 20  2017,7.9,Main dislike was the cost $2000 for 6 nights!

Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Sakyia,United States of America,1 review,February 1  2017,5.4,Staff personal couldn't find my information in their system. gave me alot of attitude for it. Contacted booking.com they found my reservation in a matter of 1 min. After finally being able to check-in my room didn't look like the one advertised on the picture. My room was much smaller for the money i paid. The location of this hotel consists of people who are on drugs and strung out. you don't really want to leave the hotel. The breakfast consisted of bagels and cereal not very filling. Lastly on booking.com it list a spa and picture of a large pool. the pool is not very big and there's no spa.. Overall I give this hotel a 5/10 the room seemed pretty clean and it was easy for me to find the hotel.,N/A

The transaction amount doesn't match at all with the amount on the bill receipt. When i called the hotel to complain. no cooperative response from the staff. I wrote them an email but no response yet. I was expecting atleast a call back from the hotel assuring that they will rectify the issue. Was not expecting this kind of hospitality from Hilton level hotels. Not worth the money i should say. 2) room curtains were thin. Noise and light pollution.,Location was good in terms of accessibility to the tourist spots MOA. freedom trail. quincy market etc.. all within 3 miles Clean hotel and rooms. Comfortable bed. Breakfast was good.

Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Marian,United States of America,2 Reviews,November 21  2016,7.1,The hotel front desk was consistently understaffed. There were often long lines and I had to wait on hold quite a bit when calling for the shuttle. The breakfast area often needed some cleaning attention. People came and went quite frequently and it was often very busy but the hotel really should assign someone to cleaning up the tables when possible--at least every 30 minutes or so.,The staff was professional and the free shuttle was a great help. The shuttle drivers are probably the unsung heroes of the hotel staff. They go out of their way to accommodate guests and their wishes and often do not receive any thanks. If you use the shuttle please tip the drivers for their service.
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Ori,Israel,3 Reviews,November 9  2016,6.7,location (must have car). price (although it was the cheapest we could find. it was more than 200$ a night!). NOTE THAT THERE ARE EXTRA CITY TAXES NO ONE MENTIONS.,free wifi. complimentary coffee and tee in lobby. spacious room. other than that nothing much really. it's more of a business hotel..
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Dominic,United Kingdom,34 Reviews,November 5  2016,7.9,The location was full of homeless people and people openly doing drugs. It didn't feel safe to leave the hotel at night,Liked the courtesy bus. and liked the packed lunch.
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Wolfgang,Germany,12 Reviews,October 27  2016,5.4,The hotel requires renovation. Though it seems to be cleaned quite well. it looks worn out. Especially the shower curtains and the missing mini bar is a no got for a 4 stars hotel,N/A
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Debra,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 26  2016,8.8,This facility was on the edge of a very shady part of town.  There were a number of homeless people sleeping and openly taking drugs beside the hotel.  Outside the hotel building was not a safe place to be. The hotel was close to the Medical Center too. so there were police sirens and rescue vehicle sirens all during the night.   The hotel did have security personnel and did offer a free shuttle to and from the airport.  We were taking a cruise and it would have been helpful to have a shuttle to the port as well.   Hop on Hop Off tour picked up at the door and dropped off. so site seeing in Boston was easy.,N/A
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,James,United States of America,1 review,October 24  2016,4.2,No local info in rooms . No local info about where to find dining . After dark the neighborhood seemed dangerous and needed to go out in search of food .,Bedding seemed very clean .Breakfast was OK .
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Beth,United States of America,1 review,October 22  2016,7.5,Location was much further then we expected from where we wanted to be.  We did not know the area well enough. It was our first time to the city.  All other Hilton properties were unavailable.  We had to stay there.  UBER best way to get a round city.,Bed was very comfortable.  Security was good inside and around building.  You do need to be careful in that area.
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Katie,United States of America,1 review,October 13  2016,7.9,Higher floor to block the street noise .,The staff was remarkably friendly and accomodating. The breakfast plentiful !The location was a bit noisey . I would recommend a higher floor should remedy the nosie . I would stay again and recommend it to friends and family. Loved the City of Boston.
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,David,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,October 13  2016,6.3,There was a noisy fan or some sort of machinery making a constant noise outside our room. We asked to changeif possible to somewhere quieter but were told that we were in the quiet side away from the road traffic. We justslept with ear plugs in.,Room was clean and comfy
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,David,United States of America,1 review,October 2  2016,9.6,We were concerned about the neighborhood as when reading some of the reviews prior to our stay. there were complaints about the sirens from the hospital and homeless people on the streets. However. the hotel was very accommodating in providing us with a room on the top floor and providing us with their shuttle service when we needed to be picked up or dropped off at a certain location so we were not exposed to the area around the hotel. The Shuttle drivers were always courteous and friendly as well as the entire staff.,My husband didn't care for the pre-made omelets and also would have preferred bacon instead of sausage. I was happy with their oatmeal. cereal choices. fruit. bagels and sweet rolls. It is very convenient to have the benefit of coffee and tea available to the guests at all time.  Also. the Japanese Restaurant next door was excellent as well as the Cuban Restaurant in the hotel.  Since we were leaving on a cruise. the location of the hotel was very convenient to where the ship was docked.
Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Boston Crosstown Center,Daniel,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,September 16  2016,10,Nothing. the hotel was perfect,Breakfast was amazing and was the best out of the 3 hotels we stayed at during our trip to the US. Little touches like calling us after entering our room to see if everything was ok and also a drink/snack when we left
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 9  2017,6.7,For a luxury hotel. the room could have been cleaner-I found a bobby pin on the floor (not mine) and the toilet could have been more thoroughly cleaned when we arrived. The lighting was very dark and the window faced another building window. so it was not all private. We could hear our neighbors and the hall to our room smelled like marijuana. The valet was overpriced. The hotel only offered coffee and a couple varieties of tea in the morning.,The bed was very comfortable and the hotel had a very cool vibe.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Scott,United States of America,1 review,October 5  2017,9.2,Two of the bartenders at Alibi were not friendly at all. I don't see it as a reflection on the hotel itself. but it did reduce they welcoming experience we had overall.,The hotel staff were welcoming and helpful and the theme and style of the hotel were exactly what we were looking for.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,John,United Kingdom,1 review,October 4  2017,7.5,Coffee facilities in room would be good. I think a Nespresso machine or similar is standard in most hotels these days.Breakfast buffet on the landing was a nice setting. but choice was fairly limited. For the price. hot food should have been a la carte rather than buffet.,Wonderful hotel setting and entrance atrium.Loved that there was a feather free floor (that is really going the extra mile for allergy sufferers)!Car hire arranged through the concierge. with the car delivered to the hotel. was fantastic service.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Caroline,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,September 29  2017,7.1,Could not work out whether it was the Hotel at fault or booking .com .. but they could not find my booking when I arrived. When you pay virtually s1000 a night  including breakfast . you don't assume to be greeted with with " we are booked up and there is no record of you . " ... either Liberty's system is poor or Booking .com .. but I do not expect to be embarrassed on check in and then wait more than 2 hours for a room.,Excellent decor and fantastic conversion of an old prison .
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Deborah,United States of America,9 Reviews,September 23  2017,9.6,Usual price per night,Love this hotel. location. bars and restaurants. Walking distance to many places. Great rate through Booking.com. Usually too expensive as I go every other week for cancer treatment. could not afford full price.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Clare,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,September 22  2017,10,Nothing,Everything!  I arrived three hours before check-in. soaking wet due to the inclement weather and they found me a room straight away.  At Scampo. I was too tired too choose....so the waiter did it for me.  Excellent choices. excellent food.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Harry,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,September 22  2017,8.8,The convention tax and resort fee adds a lot to the price per night!,This hotel definitely has the wow factor.  Very cool and trendy.  The room was amazing. huge bathroom. comfy bed.  The bar staff are really friendly and happy to make you a cocktail to your particular tastes.  Food is good. if a little pricey.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 18  2017,7.9,Fairly certain that at least some rooms are missing sound proofing between walls in bathroom...  Could hear every word/noise from early rising neighbors...,Young crowd. so keep that in mind when booking.  Added bonus - Bed was very comfortable!
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Chrissy,United States of America,1 review,September 11  2017,9.6,Parking was expensive and the overnight parking charge ($55) was not advertised at either Booking.com nor the hotels own website.  If it is there. it should be more prominent.  Also. the exposed air filter was very dirty.  Other than those two issues. the hotel was wonderful.,Hotel personnel were very friendly and helpful.  Location is great and right off the highway.  The rooms were creatively decorated. the beds were comfortable. and we will definitely be staying again.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 5  2017,3.8,Disappointed at this hotel. Staff was standoffish and seemed as though they couldn't be bothered. Room service was minimal. and house keeping will loudly bang on your door if you forget to leave the privacy tag out. the lobby transforms into a dancing floor on the evenings over the weekend. with Dj and random people walking in for dancing and drinking. We paid extra for an upgraded room that turned out to be a standard room with nothing "extra" including no view. our room was facing a nearby medical facility. The consierge was errogant. and we are glad that we did not listen to his advice to not go out of town. it was the best part of our trip. The room felt crowded with the bar stand leaving little space to reach the window or the bed. No coffee machine either (I should have spotted that when I looked up the amenities but didn't think that a luxury hotel will come non equipped this way). They do have a coffee station in the am but the quality is poor. especially for a hotel of this presumed caliber. It took long time to get the car from the parking by the valet. I have stayed at top tier luxury hotels but this hotel Wasx all together disappointing. Won't recommend and won't come back again.,The architecture was pretty. A former prison turned into a hotel. Scampo is a great option for dining in (the only great option at The liberty) though it's pricy.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Melissa,United States of America,1 review,September 3  2017,10,N/A,Top notch service. extremely comfortable bed and the luxury hair care products did not go unnoticed. Also. I loved the character and well thought out decor in the hotel and guest rooms. Some "themed" hotels can be corny. but The Liberty absolutely nailed it here. Definitely recommend!
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Michael,United States of America,1 review,August 24  2017,6.3,Out of the 5 days there the TV didn't work for 4 of these days.  No way to watch tv or a movie.  No radio or music either.  And yes we called them several times about it.  We had to call a few times to get them to make up beds and leave fresh towels.  Also found 3 long hairs in the  sink which  certainly not ours.  Just not what we expected from a 5 star hotel.,It was a nice hotel but disappointed.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Lynn,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,August 23  2017,10,Our room. just off the main atrium. had a bar station right outside serving the atrium balcony seating. It was pretty noisy and noise also carried from the main atrium at night.,Great concept (the hotel was once a prison!). Loved the vibe there on a Friday night. Drinks and dinner in Scampo were excellent. Hotel restaurants were busy which makes for a better buzz about the place. Excellent location - T stop right outside and Charles Street has a great neighbourhood feel.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Lisa,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 22  2017,10,N/A,The atmosphere is great.  Coffee station in the morning was well stocked with assorted teas and creamers.   Beds were extremely comfortable. Concierge was knowledgeable and helpful. Its great that pets can stay here.   I would definitely stay here again.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Tatiana,United States of America,10 Reviews,August 8  2017,9.6,N/A,Great atmosphere. wonderful design. and just a great place to spend weekend.

The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Russell,United States of America,1 review,August 7  2017,10,N/A,Beautiful and unique hotel! All our expectations were met and would recommended to friends. The staff is very friendly and helpful. overall service fantastic!
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Layi,Nigeria,2 Reviews,August 6  2017,7.9,I felt the hotel could have been a little more accommodating with late check -outs  especially after staying for so many days and requesting for a 3pm check out for an 1100pm flight,N/A
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Jaclyn,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 1  2017,6.7,The hotel was expensive.  It was expensive and my view was of another hotel.  No amenities re: pool or spa.  We stayed 3 days and they never refreshed our room items: aka the shower cap.  I was very surprised.,The hotel is gorgeous; a beautiful stone building with so many eye-appealing details.  I love that there is a historic background and that there are many restaurants in the hotel.  Very easy.  Room was very pretty.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,laurie yott,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 31  2017,9.2,View of brick wall out of room window.,Interesting. fun hotel (used to be a jail) with very nice but not spectacular rooms.  Breakfast in the "Clink" was very good.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Michelle,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 30  2017,7.5,The club outside had no room  for seating   smallSize  did not offer much for the price,Pillows were great   bed  awesome room  was nice  quiet relaxing
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Kristen,United States of America,1 review,July 30  2017,9.2,Booking.com,I modified my reservation on line back in March 2017 through booking.com. however upon checking in. my reservation still reflected the night prior arrival. The hotel was sold out. Luckily I had my confirmation of the modification. My husband and I had to sit in the lobby for 20 minutes till the hotel could accommodate us. Not how I wanted to start my vacation. Highly doubt I will use booking.com again.  The Liberty was fantastic.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Karen,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 26  2017,9.6,The hotel escalator to the lobby was out of service for most of my stay. I'm disabled so the extra walking was a major inconvenience.,The location was the perfect place for viewing Boston's July 4 fireworks.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Sal,United States of America,1 review,July 13  2017,8.8,attitude of breakfast staff. everyone else was very good.  concierge was incredible. a asset to entire staff,location is great. dinner was excellent. breakfast staff left a little bit to be desired. got there late (10:48 AM) and was told had to hurry up because kitchen was closing for breakfast orders. food arrived and still was good.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Rachael,Netherlands,2 Reviews,July 12  2017,9.6,N/A,Loved the character of the building. The location is AWESOME! Charles Street. with all sorts of cute little boutiques and restaurants. is right out the door. And Boston Gardens. Charles River Esplanade are both within an under 10 minute walk. Also. theres a train station directly across the street.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Lisa,United States of America,7 Reviews,July 12  2017,7.5,rooms are much smaller than what pictures depict.air conditioning system is terrible. the only thing cool in the entire room is a window.no coffee pot in room. hotel lobby coffee area tiny with lines to get a tiny cup.one bowl of oatmeal. a smoothie. and a tiny orange juice cost $65 from room service.maid service banging on my door at 9:30 asking me what time i am leaving my room on day of departure. nice way to end your stay.,staff was awesome. lobby and renovations are great. on site scampo restaurant was excellent and the waiter completely made the experience worthwhile.  also staff in hotel lobby bar extremely accommodating.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Liliana,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 9  2017,9.6,The breakfast at the clink seemed overpriced.,We had dinner at Scampo which was completely amazing.  Food. Service. Ambiance. all well worth the price.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Kelly,United States of America,1 review,July 9  2017,10,N/A,Great staff allowed us to check in early upon arrival from our red eye flight. A blessing!

The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,James,United States of America,1 review,July 6  2017,10,Upgraded wifi should be included.,Beautiful property. location. facilities. rooms and service. At the cost. upgraded wifi should be included. Walk to most areas of Boston easily.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Serguei,Canada,2 Reviews,June 28  2017,10,N/A,Excellent luxury hotel with an intriguing history (ex-jail!). Great room design. Festive atmosphere. Superb service - always and everywhere. Architecturally unique. Excellent outdoors restaurant (but too noisy inside). Expensive but worth it.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Michael,United States of America,1 review,June 21  2017,9.6,Not a fan of Kurig coffee in the room. (but had coffee in the Lobby in the morning). Would have preferred feather pillows. but the ones they had were manageable.,Great view from the 15th floor of Downtown Boston. Very comfortable room. Great people watching in the lobby... The Lobster pizza at Scampo was amazing! Ate at the bar with full menu service and no reservation on a Friday night. Very accommodating and friendly staff.

The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Lashan,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 11  2017,9.6,$55 per night valet parking is insane!  As a serious coffee drinker. I was not a fan of the coffee offered in Links restaurant....tasted horrible.  Luckily other coffee options were just a few minutes walk.,I am VERY particular about hotels and I will definitely recommend staying at The Liberty.  I arrived at 10am from the West Coast and they were able to accommodate me right away; My room was great!  Both the bathroom and bedroom were very spacious and nicely decorated with the "key" theme.  The staff were awesome at every encounter...front desk. concierge. valet. doorman. housekeeper. Links restaurant. etc.   Conveniently located to TD Garden. as I was in town for game 7 of the NBA Eastern Conference Finals and was able to walk 10-mins to the arena safely.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Deborah,United States of America,1 review,June 6  2017,5.8,Scampi restaurant staff was nowhere up to par given their exhorbanate prices. Menu was WAY overpriced.,The history and architectural rehabilitation is awesome.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,David,Singapore,75 Reviews,May 21  2017,9.6,It is a little walk across a few roads to be in the centre of business or historic Boston. but just one road from Beacon Hill district,Staff and rooms that are not as boring as most hotels

The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Lori,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 3  2017,10,We loved everything.,The service  was amazing… From check in to check out nothing could have been improved upon. Loved the champagne upon check-in and throughout the day and evening. Staff was exceptionally helpful regarding places to eat and tours.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Charles,Bermuda,1 review,April 25  2017,10,N/A,Your staff are delightful.  We have stayed at the Liberty many. many times over the last two years. the nicest touch is to be greeted by your name. they take the extra step and remember you.Room service is prompt and efficient. the restaurants are excellent.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,April 13  2017,6.7,The staff at check-in gave me a "different" look after knowing I just got 21 couple days ago. and said that "you know you need to be 21 to stay here right?" then he looked at me as if he knew I'm getting this room for a party and will be drunk and loud...Well I don't know if that's why I got both my neighbors partying their 21 bday who were pretty drunk and loud...,The history and story of this hotel is quite interesting. There are key displays in our room that was pretty special.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Bev,Canada,5 Reviews,April 10  2017,10,N/A,A remarkable transformation and re-imagining of a jail to a luxury hotel. You just have to book a stay to experience the setting.Great vibe. food. entertainment. experience. Nice touch with the complimentary champagne at check in. Great to find a hotel that just gets it on all levels.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Dr,United States of America,3 Reviews,April 10  2017,9.6,Parking there is Valet only. and they charge exorbitant rates.  I parked in the Mass General parking lot and received a discount because we were visiting my mother. so I feel lucky that we had that option.  Parking two cars in the Mass General lot was less expensive than parking one through the hotel.,The staff is absolutely outstanding.  My daughter and I booked a room at the hotel because it is next to Mass General Hospital.  A blizzard had been forecast and my mother was dying.  There was a person at the front desk who bent over backwards to assist me in finding the best rate.  Had we been there under different circumstances. we may have spent more time in the hotel. enjoying the restaurants there.  We are locals. so it was necessity that brought us to the hotel. not vacation.  The accommodations were comfortable and the front desk assistance was nothing short of amazing!
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Johan,Belgium,10 Reviews,April 5  2017,6.7,I did not like the extra charges that came un announced. No problem with city tax but why pay for 'free internet' and glass of prosecco at the reception. I felt robbed. Never again,Location and room
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Linda,United States of America,7 Reviews,March 26  2017,8.8,Had an adjoining room in which the occupant was very loud late into the night and then again next morning. After we called desk. he finally quieted down after midnight. Would suggest not putting strangers in adjoining rooms when possible.,Very comfortable bed. nice bathroom. clean. nice view from high up. Like the Scampo restaurant if you don't feel like venturing into the city. It is expensive. though. probably not for Boston. We got a good price. Free waters in room nice touch.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Geniene,United States of America,4 Reviews,March 19  2017,10,Would request a room on side of hotel away from emergency room of hospital. Surprisingly not too noisy but just not great view,Beds and linens excellent. Comfy bathrobe.large flarscreen tv. Nice and happening bar. Somewhat of a scene the night we were there but a fun vibe. Complimentary coffee in lobby in morning  nice touch. Great food at clink if a little pricey. Would definitely stay there again.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,March 14  2017,10,Gym was woefully inadequate.  SUPER small with no place to stretch.  Such a large hotel should have more space dedicated to a gym.  Super drafty by the elevators and the gym.,LOVED the Catwalk for guests. a great place to view the action below.  And concierge was wonderful.  He set up massages in our room and gave great advice on the area.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Keith,United States of America,2 Reviews,March 7  2017,8.8,There was a coffee spill in one of the elevators--it wasn't me. I swear!--and it went un-attended for a surprising amount of time.,Location. location. location! Ability to stream content onto hotel room TV! Beautiful lobby with fun atmosphere.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Maria,United States of America,1 review,February 26  2017,9.6,Cost of overnight parking,Great check-in experience (champagne. apples. helpful staff). modern facilities. hip vibe. great restaurant/bar choices. Wish we stayed another night to take advantage of all the hotel had to offer.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Robert,United States of America,3 Reviews,February 23  2017,4.6,Put us in a pet room without asking about allergies. Then moved us to a room where they were unloading trucks outside our window all night. Could not sleep!Bathroom sink didn't drain. They promised to fix it while we were at dinner. They did not even try. Elevator wouldn't stop on our floor even with GM's master key. Had to take the stairs. Coffee in lobby was empty. Took over 20 minutes to refill it. Other than that.......,Nice architecture and rooms
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Brandon,United States of America,1 review,February 21  2017,10,Nothing. The hotel was spectacular.,The fact that it was an old jail converted to a hotel was interesting. Bed was amazing and soft. Bathroom was spacious with the tub and stand up shower.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Cathryn,United States of America,1 review,February 15  2017,8.3,I didn't like that I was charged $20 for a plain bowl of chicken broth when for the same money you can order an entire eggs benedict.  I was on a dietary restriction where it was the only food I could have. so I ordered 2 of them twice. and din't realize it cost me $80!  It was supposed to be clear broth but on the following morning it came not clear so I could not eat it.  They said they'd take it off the bill but the did not take it off the bill.  A cup of tea was $10. too.  I'm used to hotels having expensive food and the regular meals seemed normal with that in mind. but $10 for a tea bag and some hot water?  They should try to fix all their pricing to be more fair and when they say they'll take it  off the bill. follow through and do it. The wifi is ok on the computer (though slow) although it did not work at all on our cell phones. It kept wanting us to log in over and over. It's a bit cold in the living area. Not in temperature because there are decent controls for that. just in that the couch and chairs are a leathery or vinyl material.,The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable and the Charles River suite was a great size for what we needed.  I loved the lighting as we turned off all he lights at night but there was just enough light in the hall and bathroom for me as I had to get up and go all night and didn't want to wake up the person that was with me.  The extra 1/2 bathroom was critical for us. There was a minibar but also an empty fridge about the same size and we really needed it to store some medication and diet-restricted food I needed.  The staff were super friendly and accommodating. especially the front desk person who checked us in and out. They gave us a glass of champagne upon checking in which made us feel immediately like we were in vacation / relaxation mode.  Very smart idea.  The bathroom had this amazing hand wash liquid soap with even more amazing coco hand cream and I had to wash hands all night due to a procedure I was having so this proved to be critical.  The bathroom in the charles river suite has everything you'd want in the bathroom as well as the whole suite. The extra living area has a very comfortable couch and one of the chairs is comfy too.  There's a coffee table to put things on or put your feet up.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,David,United States of America,61 Reviews,February 1  2017,7.5,My wife was hassled by a rude front desk person about which credit card we used.

Really great food st the restaurant. especially the grouper.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Connie,United States of America,1 review,February 1  2017,9.6,PRICES! Got the room at a semi-decent price. However. $7 for a bottle of water?! My siblings all got a glass of champagne upon check-in. I. however. was not offered anything.,The bed was fantastic! Loved the deep soaking tub. Had diner at Scampo.

The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,axgiggles,United States of America,9 Reviews,January 22  2017,9.2,The bar is awkwardly set up in the lobby so it can be a little loud.,The hotel is really beautiful. They incorporated a lot of the jail setup into the hotel design and made it modern and attractive at the same time. I really liked the keys they had all over the hotel.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Benz,Canada,5 Reviews,January 19  2017,7.9,I've had several annoying experiences with the staff. from them not being able to locate my reservation for half an hour. to me trying to reach guest services without success for 20 minutes at night. A hotel of this calibre should have stuff like this ironed out. fast.,The room was great. from the bed to the bathroom. And the hotel's overall design and vibe are fun and nicely done.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Anonymous,United Arab Emirates,2 Reviews,January 9  2017,8.8,Room got a bit stuffy. but they fixed that the second night by providing a box fan for the room.,Design and quality finishings. Comfortable amenities in the room.

The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Anthony,United States of America,6 Reviews,December 21  2016,10,at the check in there was a problem with the rate.  initially they wanted to charge me with double the agreed upon rate.  it was eventually resolved,everything
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Angelo,United States of America,6 Reviews,December 19  2016,7.9,I did not like in restaurant at breakfast the waitress brought over juice in a carafe and coffee and asked to pour but we didn't  think there was a charge for the juice 6.00 a glass absurd,N/A
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Alexander,Canada,1 review,December 19  2016,8.3,Price of the food was a little riduculous. We were at Scampo and I had the veal. The veal was done well but very little seasoning and I could hardly taste the marsala.,The location and the historical background
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Jonathan,United States of America,1 review,December 6  2016,8.3,I wish there was parking for the hotel. It would have made bringing my belongs to my room before check in/after checkout much easier.,The staff was very friendly and it was easy enough to figure out the layout of the hotel.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Stephen,United States of America,7 Reviews,December 6  2016,8.8,Room was only ok. next to ice machine. housekeeping closet. and overlooking air ducts. Of course. I was paying a  discounted rate which likely accounted for location. so can't complain much as there was a lot to do within easy walking distance so we spent minimal time in room.,Staff. room cleanliness. and location of hotel were all excellent.  Restaurants also top notch.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Gail-ann,United States of America,2 Reviews,December 2  2016,10,Nothing,An awesome place to stay and relax. close to public transit. a definite plus. The bar in the lobby was very nice. friendly bartenders. The bar food was another plus.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Robert,United States of America,1 review,December 2  2016,10,They claim they do not have the "quadruple room "I purchased from you. I paid above the low cost room to obtain the extra space. They claim your information you have on line and in my confirmation of "room discription " on email is incorrect and no such accommodation exists. The room they put us in 1218 was available the same night for $199. Obviously you should be refunding me the difference.,Very accommodating staff
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Kathleen,United States of America,4 Reviews,November 28  2016,8.8,-one entire side of the main hotel tower faces a nondescript stucco wall of the MA general hospital just above the main emergency  room entrance. We got a room on that side.-sheets kinda sub-par for this level of hotel-one of the concierges was unnecessarily stuck up,-separate soaking tub in bathroom-quirky decor-hi definition TV worked well
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Margaret,United States of America,1 review,November 9  2016,8.8,Slightly musty sheet smell.  Clock not updated to time change.   Both very minor quibbles,Loved the location and view of the city.   The bed was very comfortable and the handicapped bathroom very well appointed.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Tom,United Kingdom,13 Reviews,October 21  2016,10,Having to leave!,Everything from check in to departure. Boston is an expensive city for good hotels but this was 100% worth it. The staff were uber friendly. great rooms. and a great location to explore the city.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Michael,Canada,1 review,October 4  2016,4.2,Very noisy in the rooms. You can hear everything from the hall and in the neighbors room and the doors naturally slam shut.Bed sheets were ripped and the telephones did not work. Cleaning staff also woke us up every morning knocking on our door as we did not have a privacy label for our door. Very disappointing stay and I am not one to complain!,Good location.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Vagabond,Canada,1 review,October 3  2016,4.6,Nowhere does it mention that the entire lobby turns into a loud disco on weekends. Can't get a taxi near so have to walk from the road with your luggage. Can't even get in the door for all the drunk 25 year olds crammed into the building. Not a suitable property for anyone over 40.,Funky heritage building.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Graham,United Kingdom,24 Reviews,September 27  2016,9.2,Free wifi very poor. Why do you have to pay 19.95 in an expensive hotel when you get the same service for free with a coffee at Starbucks?,Good location and interesting design.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Joan,Ireland,1 review,September 22  2016,9.6,Expensive.. From the pictures it looks like there is a hotel pool and roof top bar which you can use. this is not the case.,Location. service and hotel were all top class.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Aba,Switzerland,25 Reviews,September 20  2016,9.2,They couldn't find my reservation as they used my middle name as surname in their booking system,Great original hotel. close to Boston subway and in a nice area.Big room. spotlessy clean and loved how it was decorated.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Penny,United States of America,1 review,September 4  2016,9.6,Breakfast at Clink could have been better quality.

Bed very comfortable.
The Liberty, a Luxury Collection Hotel,Ronald,United States of America,5 Reviews,August 29  2016,8.8,Wifi was USD 19.95 in order to have a somehow acceptable speed.

Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Ken,United States of America,1 review,October 24  2017,10,Limited dining options at hotel and in general area.,Room clean and staff very helpful.  We booked a room for a weekend getaway in Boston.  Chose this property because I have had good experiences with Courtyard Marriot’s in the past and was not disappointed.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Chris Shoemaker,Switzerland,14 Reviews,October 13  2017,6.7,Expensive. you would even get a cheaper (and better) room at Zurich airport in Switzerland.,Good airport hotel. Very close to the terminals. free shuttles available.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Kathleen,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 11  2017,3.5,The  electricity went out   one night   and  I couldn't see  anything in  my room. My phone was dead and I couldn't  charge it.  The  response  from the manager  was  "Well  at least nobodydied"  The shuttle was NEVER on Time. The response was there is no set schedule. Well when your'retraveling and need to get to the airport you need a set schedule. I had 3 shulttles go by me at the Logan Airport and they were empty. The green bus and the driver ignored me. I had to  wait  for 45 minutes in front of  the Bus Depot before I got picked up. There was only one other person on when I finally got picked up.All these happened repeatedly even though I kept calling The Front Desk and was transferred to the "Sales Desk" or reservations. The elevators are filthy.I was struggling to get my bags over to the  elevator to get to 7th floor and Not one of the 3 staffers there even offered to give me a   little helpThis hotel needs some serious intervention. Who is in charge?,The young man that  was  a waiter in the bar assisted me   at a busy time to       get  food  to go
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Terry,United States of America,5 Reviews,October 11  2017,7.1,Two things.  The sliding barn door on the bathroom was idiotic. didn't work very well. and was really lacking in providing privacy.  Other thing was the price.  $301 for a nice room in a hotel in an industrial area next to a major airport is absolutely ridiculous and the only reason I accepted it was because we had no knowledge of the area and wanted to be close because we had a very early morning flight out.  We checked in and immediately took the rental car back because the hotel wanted $25/day to park on their property according to their literature.  They also wanted exorbitant amounts for breakfast.  Shuttle was free.....surprisingly.  And now. it has nothing to do with the hotel but Booking dot Com asked me who I traveled with and I didn't answer because one of the possible answers allowed was NOT wife/husband.  What's with you B.Com?  You think everyone is shacking up with same sex friend. mistress. stranger. or what?  We'd just gotten off a cruise ship with around 800 married couples so I know we're not the only ones left.,Check in was a snap.  Friendly front desk.  Good shuttle service to/from airport.  Decent sized room with good furnishings and just the right amount of bedding rather than the 8 pillows on a bed motif commonly seen these days.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,John,United States of America,5 Reviews,October 5  2017,6.3,I asked for some restaurant recommendations and was handed a poorly prepared list. We chose one that turned out to be a greasy spoon which we left immediately upon entering. The place was not up to acceptable Marriott standrds.,N/A
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Diane,United States of America,1 review,October 3  2017,10,Can't think of anything. Oh. could have used a charging station in the lobby because my phone was dead and I left my charger at a friends. The desk,I had a great stay. not long enough. Would definitely return.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Sally,United States of America,1 review,October 3  2017,9.6,N/A,They have a very good. full service restaurant that serves food until 10 pm. This is great if you get in late and had very little to eat on a 5 hour flight from CA.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Dawn,United States of America,1 review,October 1  2017,7.1,The location was not ideal. When booking I searched the distance from places we wanted to go and it wasn't far but. I didn't realize it was on a highway and we wouldn't be able to feel safe walking so we had to drive everywhere and pay for parking. Also we used the hot tub and were joined by some unaccompanied children and another couple who with all of us in there decided to have sex in the hot tub. Perhaps the pool area should be better monitored.,The staff was very friendly. helpful and entertaining. The artwork the have on display on each floor across from the elevator doors was beautiful.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Zachary,United States of America,6 Reviews,September 27  2017,5.8,Bed was one of the most uncomfortable beds I've ever slept on. Noisy and not much of a view to speak of (we stayed on the side closer to the freeway).,Relatively easy access to airport. Do not recommend trying to use the exit on freeway side. use rear entrance/exit which puts you out by a traffic light.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,David,Australia,6 Reviews,September 6  2017,8.3,N/A,At the end of 2 long flights. the hotel was a welcome sight! Having a free shuttle from the airport made the transfer very easy. The check-in was handled speedily and the room very comfortable. We had a restful night's sleep and a leisurely check-out the following day.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Judith,United States of America,19 Reviews,August 22  2017,9.2,They need to upgrade to Keurigs in room and i hate Powdered creamers whitch they have in rooms. Ugh.,The airport shuttle was very convenient and frequent. We had stayed at a neighboring property when arriving in Boston a week earlier. Their bedding was over the top and 'way too warm for the heat wave we were in. I was comfortable under the lighter weight covers here. We didnt try the breakfast because of timing. Bed was great and so were sheets.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Matthew,United States of America,1 review,August 21  2017,7.9,The hotel restaurant was a disgrace. Understaffed and long waits.

Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Holly,United States of America,1 review,July 22  2017,4.2,No continental breakfast. food was terrible and way over priced. water leaks in the restaurant and on the first floor. bed was terribly uncomfortable and so were the pillows. the shower did not drain. the staff barely cleaned the room. My son got crumbs on the floor and office chair which were still there After they cleaned that day. And the shuttle did not pick us up when I called they did not come in to the pick up area at the train station and we could not see them for the other busses.,Staff was nice
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Angela,United States of America,1 review,July 21  2017,6.7,The price for the room was too much! Airport location was noisy and busy. you sacrifice peace and quiet when you want to be close to the airport.,I liked the free airport shuttle. and the recommendation to Mario's Italian restaurant
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Irma,United States of America,7 Reviews,July 17  2017,6.7,Too expensive for what it was. Should have offered more than just coffee. even a continental breakfast would have added value.,Reliable shuttle to airport
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Robert,United States of America,10 Reviews,July 12  2017,9.6,Nothing. Price was high. but competitive in Boston market.,Room was good size. provided airport shuttle. had an army of staff at front desk to accommodate cancelled flight crowd. and were extremely cordial.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Jodene,United States of America,3 Reviews,June 27  2017,8.8,N/A,The staff was very pleasant and helpful.  The room was clean and comfortable. We sleep with a fan everynight. so with that going you couldn't hear the jets at the airport. Convenient location for all the attractions we visited.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Jorge,United States of America,27 Reviews,June 26  2017,8.3,Rooms and corridors need update to keep up with the rest,Great swimming pool and outdoor garden. Great lobby and restaurant. Housekeeping manager was excellent and did make the difference on our stay.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Patricia,Abkhazia, ​ Georgia,2 Reviews,June 19  2017,8.8,The restaurant was very expensive for what you got.  The shuttle. picking us up at the end of our trip .was much to small and could not accommodate seating for everyone. This left handicapped people standing as well as parents with small children. Not a safe way to travel in a small shuttle through Boston.,I liked that we could leave our car there for a week.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Nathan,United States of America,1 review,June 12  2017,6.3,My wife and I booked the hotel to get some much needed sleep after a long trip.

Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,May 25  2017,9.2,The pillows were very uncomfortable.,Great location!

Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Erica,United States of America,6 Reviews,April 25  2017,5.4,unexpected parking fee upon arrival- thought it was already included in price!  this added over $100 more to our booking cost.  parking free for a night. not for extended stay like the 6 days we needed it for,shuttle pick up at airport
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Paul,United States of America,1 review,March 21  2017,7.5,The restaurant menu was a pub affair compared to what I have had there in the past 2 years ago I had an amazing steak this time I was limited to a burger,Park and fly. However it was not relayed to me that the price was room only  I had to pay more when I arrived

Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Michelle,United States of America,4 Reviews,February 9  2017,7.5,What I did not like was the smell of my bathroom.  It smelled a little like vomit and the bath towels had a hint of mildew smell on it.  It was such a same because everything else in the room was fantastic.,I liked the size of the room and the food in the restaurant.  I highly recommend the lobster roll which comes with thick cut fries.  Really delicious.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Christopher,United States of America,1 review,February 4  2017,3.3,The pool was broken. the entire reason I pick this hotel over cheaper ones. the room was very. very small and very worn and run down.,I liked that I could park my car. and the shuttle service

Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Bonita,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 30  2016,10,N/A,The staff was awesome. We checked out and because we had a late flight that evening. they were super accommodating letting us swim and hot tub. The food was really good oin the restaurant too.

Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Jean53,United States of America,5 Reviews,October 25  2016,9.2,Wish that breakfast was included in the price.

Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Bruce,United States of America,15 Reviews,October 25  2016,10,N/A,Room and bed were very comfortable.  Excellent location.  Take the Dulles Expressway right into downtown DC.  The Expressway drops you onto Constitution Ave.  Perfect if you are looking to tour monuments and museums.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,September 30  2016,6.7,At around 11.30pm. the piping in my bathroom began to rumble very loudly for no apparent reason. and this went on for over an hour and would have made it impossible to sleep had it continued longer. Since it was late. I just waited for the noise to stop rather than asking to be moved or taking any other action. But I'm sure this problem must have been going on for a while. and (while it may have been isolated to one room) it seems that making sure it is quiet enough to sleep is a fairly basic requirement of any hotel.,Most things (e.g. general state of rooms. restaurant. etc.) were as expected in a mid-range airport hotel. It was also very conveniently located for Logan Airport.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Karim,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 26  2016,9.6,Nothing.  The back road to the center of Orient Heights is a bit sketchy after dark. but that's out of their control.,The room was well insulated for sound. unlike many other hotels I have stayed in. so I had a very peaceful night's sleep despite the small party in the room next door (evident from the hallway).  Amazingly. I ran into some friends.  The restaurant was also quite good.  The shuttle service got me to and from the airport with no trouble.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Ohiotoboston,United States of America,1 review,September 26  2016,5.4,There was no minibar inside the room. ALL the pillows were too thick for my liking. The amount of TV options was minimal. There was only 1 wash cloth in the room (I wanted to freshen up at night AND in the morning). Not great for the amount of money I spent.,Close to airport.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Debbie,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 25  2016,10,Nothing,We arrived early and our room was not ready. The woman at the front desk. looked and told us they had another room and offered it to us. It was a handicapped room. which was fine and we were tired. The room was much bigger and we were able to sign in earlier. She was awesome!!!! The staff was great. The food was awesome in the Restaurant. with nice seating area like you were sitting in your own home with T.Vs.  Just had a issue with them charging my card twice in error. Contacted Carol in the Accounting department and she's working to resolve it..We asked them to light the fire pit for us and they did. We would definitely stay there again.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Ann,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 22  2016,6.7,Ventilation system in room was poor -too cold on one side of the room and too warm on the other.Absolutely NO ventilation in the bathroom keeping that was too steamy after showers.,N/A

Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Jane,United States of America,1 review,September 8  2016,4.6,The hotel was way overpriced for what it was.  The television had very few channels--I wanted to watch the US Open. and ESPN 2 was listed as one of the channels. but not available.  I checked with the front desk and an engineer came to the room to explain that the arrangement with direct tv had reduced the line-up substantially.  The channels we could get were not good pictures. smashed vertically in the screen with great distortion. fuzzy. etc.  The toilet also didn´t work well.  It only accepted what went directly into the hole. no paper around the sides or anything. so I had to pour water into the toilet to get it to accept what it was given. and flush several times.  That is surely not a water saver.  The restaurant was very indifferent. rather cold hamburger. catsup only begrudgingly given. sour service.  I would never stay in this hotel again. or in any courtyard marriott for that matter.,N/A
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Carol,United States of America,1 review,September 6  2016,9.6,Pillows were a little harder than I like but that is the ONLY issue and that was minor.,The shuttle drivers were all very pleasant and accommodating. The pool and hot tub were great and having coffee available in the lobby was wonderful!
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 2  2016,5.0,For a room that costs $230 a night (and this was advertised as a deal). at least free breakfast should be included. and a bottle of water should be waiting on the night stand. AT LEAST. It is embarrassing. Is this what our country has come to? Exploiting exhausted travelers. that cannot make it to the city center at midnight because of delayed or cancelled flights. without giving them so much as a free bagel?? Really. $230 is half of someone's salary people. A bagel with cream cheese at the hotel's restaurant costs $6! Just sad. Airlines don't give a damn. hotels thrive on it. and the American people watch and weep.,N/A
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Kayla,United States of America,1 review,August 23  2016,7.9,The restaurant took a while to seat us and seemed very unorganized. The airport shuttle doesn't have a set schedule it comes whenever it finishes its route. There is not room service.,The comfy King size bed was a plus. The shuttles didn't have a set schedule but they did offers to take you the nearest train station as well as the airport and some local restaurants. Oh and FREE PARKING!
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Seth,United States of America,1 review,August 15  2016,5.0,Hot water would not stop flowing - scalded myself in the shower and in the sink. Room seemed pretty dated. Where I was sitting at the bar just smelled like the dishwasher below - not a very nice experience at the bar.,Location good. parking was easy.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Bonnie,United States of America,7 Reviews,August 12  2016,2.9,Staff attitude was very unfriendly and the beds and pillows were rock hard.,Airport shuttle was easy with no long waits and they dropped us at other neighborhood places and picked us up.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Shawn,United States of America,7 Reviews,July 25  2016,7.5,Staff wasn't all too friendly upon check-in. We lost power while using hair dryer and was told the issue would be resolved that night. No one ever called or showed up until we requested in person the following morn. When repairman came to the door after learning of our issue he told us that was a matter of pushing a button downstairs and was fixed immediately. The Brickleys restaurant located in the hotel was terrible with rude staff and lack of attention given while dining. Food was below expectations. I do not recommend this faculty.,Location was excellent to airport and the free shuttle service.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Nancy,United States of America,1 review,July 21  2016,7.1,Paying $300. for that kind of stay.,I like the fact it was near the airport and I had a very early flight.

Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,John,Norway,2 Reviews,July 14  2016,5.4,N/A,Location near to airport. free parking. good beds and room good for the three of us w/2 queen size beds.Convenient for a nights sleep beteen an intercontinental flight and driving further north.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,John,United Kingdom,14 Reviews,July 13  2016,6.7,We checked into this hotel on Sunday the 10th July prior to our return trip home from Boston on Monday the 11th July as previously arranged. No Breakfast was offered to us paid for.or otherwise.for the following morning.of our arrival.We arrived both dehydrated and lethargic.feeling so tired we had no wish to leave our room that evening.following a busy day of travel.We later discovered that although there was a drink making machine in our room.there were just three lone packs of coffee.no teabags...I do not drink coffee...no other pack of drink of any description.no milk. no cream.or half and half.no sugar.and much to our surprise no room service either.we rang down to the front desk to inquire about these items.we were informed that these items were available 5 flights down in the cafe. which we discovered the following morning was actually a table in the lobby.We requested them for our room to be told...Sorry we do not offer this service...!!! We was welcome to come down for some if we wished.I don't know who at that moment in time was the laziest or the tiredest? We got no joy from the front desk and then to add insult to injury."so to speak" a bill for our room was inside our room on the floor at 5 am the following morning for the princely sum of $279 which was the total including the three taxes.for our thirsty overnight stay.The only saving grace was the bathroom tap and our request for a late checkout the following day. which was allowed much to our surprise.as our room was not yet booked for that day.We were able to go out into the city for brunch.a $20 taxi ride away.for a  much needed meal with copious amounts of liquid refreshment. just before our extensive flight back to England. We are a retired couple of senior citizens with worn knees.and spines.and we feel that we were treat with almost total ignorance.,N/A

Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Nuage,China,7 Reviews,June 25  2016,7.1,Room size is a little bit small. Disappointing buffet breakfast.,Shuttle bus service is nice. can also stops at subway station and car rental centre. Shower water is hot and stream is comfortable. No convenience store around. but a vendoring place at lobby.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 20  2016,5.0,There were empty containers of alcohol near ice machnines on three floors. Two of the floors I visited had broken ice machines. Information I received on the phone turned out to be incorrect once I arrived. Phone calls were hurried and disjointed.,The Room Was VERY Average For The cost. Nothing really stood out as great that you couldn't get somewhere else. The only thing good seemed to be distance from the airport and speddy shuttle service.

Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,William,United States of America,3 Reviews,June 10  2016,6.7,Toilet ran all night with leaky valve. The air conditioner sounded like it was on its last legs. It would have been very objectionable if I had not been so tired. At least it provided cool air. The bed covers were skimpy. Not up to Marriott's standards.,Staff friendly and very helpful. Check-in and out was fast and efficient.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Kornik,United States of America,3 Reviews,May 28  2016,8.3,Restaurant was expensive.

Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Patrick,United States of America,1 review,May 24  2016,7.9,The room was nice but.... I discovered whoever made the bed must have had a nose bleed when making it up.  There were blood drops about midway down on the sheet so when I went to sleep i didn't notice the blood until the next morning....yuck it was dried blood but still that was a nightmare.  Now the bed othet than that was comfortable...,Hotel was overall nice which includes the staff. the food. and the bar.
Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Stacy,United States of America,1 review,May 24  2016,4.2,This was the most extremely traumatic turn of events that unfolded in your hotel on Saturday evening 5-21-16. I was returning from the hotel pool with my wife and two sons which are 2 and 5 years of age. Apon returning to our room we discovered our room key was not working and appeared to be deactivated.  I told my wife to wait by the door and I would quickly go to the front desk and ask for help. Before I left i gave my shirt to my son because he was very cold in air conditioned hallway. As I approached and told front desk employee I was locked out he quickly attempted to fix the issue. I then was approached by the hotel manager who began yelling at me for not wearing a shirt. I then tried to explain my situation and he told me that I needed to leave his hotel. I attempted once again to explain my situation and he said I need to go outside right now and he was calling the police.  I said I will leave it just need to get my kids and wife and belongings first. The manager then came from around the counter and confronted me and I turned and went to the elevator. He then held his hand on the door so it could not close and continued to yell "Get out of my hotel right now!" I repeatedly asked to get my family as they were sitting in hallway still waiting for me. He continued to shout at me so I walked to the stairs the whole time being followed and shouted at by him. As I got back to my family and back into my room my wife attempted to call and talk to him and he also shouted athe her. As my wife cried we packed our things and we're escorted out by police in front of my small children. I am disgusted by the lack of professionalism and simple human regard. Me and my family were treated like animals and kicked out of a hotel out of state forced to try and find somewhere to stay last minute paying much more money then we anticipated spending.

Courtyard by Marriott Boston Logan Airport,Tiffini,United States of America,1 review,May 17  2016,7.1,The room was booked on Booking.com and when I arrived I asked if the card I give is for incidentals only where they advised it was. My mother who was traveling with me also asked at a later date. Also. before arriving I called and my mother called to make sure we knew how payment was handled. We were advised the room was paid for via internet booking then as well. But the card used on Booking.com never got charged and my card I put up for incidentals was charged for the entire stay the day after we left. I am not mad my card was charged but I am not happy that noone knows how this works and even more so that I did not receive a call to advise my card would be charged. I never signed anything and this is concerning especially because the card intended to be used was not what I put up for incidentals.,Staff/ Cleaning lady was really friendly and helpful when asked questions as were everyone else. The Shuttle service was a huge plus.

Evolve Fenway Diamond,Anonymous,United States of America,21 Reviews,October 7  2017,9.2,This is an apartment. so don't expect hotel type service.  On arrival. the door codes offered worked and a pleasant gentleman came by later with a key.  There is no adjacent parking in the apartment garage or on the street.  When I called the manager (on the phone number given with the access email). no parking options were provided.  It turns out -with a little exploration - there is a parking garage within easy walking distance. and directions would have been very useful.  This is important if traveling with heavy suitcases.,The one bedroom apartment is fully functional modern and clean.  Restaurants and shops were nearby.  Fenway Park was an easy 15-minute walk.  There was easy access to public transportation.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Bryant,United States of America,1 review,October 4  2017,2.9,Upon Arrival - The shower door was missing and had to be replaced the following day - The maintenance workers didn't even knock when they came in to replace. The door was broken on one of the bedrooms. The beds were broken down and need to be replaced. Really looked like someone had a bachelor party the prior to us arriving and none of the repairs had been done.,N/A
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Mikayla,United States of America,1 review,September 26  2017,4.2,There was no one there to assist us in checking in. There was no front desk. I received an email taking me to one room that I didn't have access to. and when I called customer service they sent me to room that was not able to fit everyone in my party. When I continued calling customer service I received no help from the 8 people I talked to until I contacted booking.com to get my money back. Very disorganized system and extremely unprofessional means of handling a situation gone wrong.,good location
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Jillian,United States of America,1 review,September 25  2017,7.1,We were given the wrong room number by Evolve Diamond and therefore could not get the key from the lockbox. When I reached out for assistance the only option was to leave a message and instead of getting a call back I got a text message from someone who would not identify themselves. who was rude.  and who acted as if it was my fault that the wrong room number was given to me. Very unprofessional.,The apartment was in a good location. clean and modern.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Leann,United States of America,1 review,September 10  2017,8.3,The bed was horrible. We think it's broken. The middle sinks in so much we did not sleep well.

Evolve Fenway Diamond,Anonymous,China,3 Reviews,July 16  2017,6.7,Check-in process was appalling. When they say they're going to email you instructions before your 4pm check-in. they really do mean right before that. No interaction with staff whatsoever. So guests arriving without access to wifi or data are out of luck. Number listed on the front of building is not a 24-hour concierge for short term stays. real estate agent doesn't know anything. neither does the supervisor of the building. No cleaning. No extra toilet paper. Limited amenities in bathroom and kitchen like soap. Ground level apartment with 2 entrances- the one that goes right out into the street is unsafe and isn't sealed properly.,Spacious. quiet. location nestled in a low-key area by all the fun.

Evolve Fenway Diamond,Kathleen,United States of America,1 review,April 12  2017,4.6,Do not book anything through Northeast Suites. Our original reservation was at Evolve Basically you're renting an apartment. with amenities listed that you are not entitle as a "guest". We rented a two bedroom apartment with a pull out couch for our family of 5. There were sheets for the pull out couch but no blanket. When I called concierge they told me to call the 1-800 number at northeast to get a blanket. Also needed to contact them to get wifi password. There was no hair dryer which was listed as an amenity. Northeast could not answer any questions about parking that was available you had to figure that in your own. even though again parking is listed as another amenity. When we checked in Northeast Suites did not send over our Welcome packet. When I called them they said they sent it via email... but I never received it??,N/A
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Igor,United States of America,1 review,April 10  2017,8.8,In the day I booked the apartment. I didn't receive a message about how to get the key. So I spent some nervous minutes in the day I arrived figuring out what to do. I couldn't get the answer by their phone so I used the email. It worked. I was told that they sent me the message day before. I don't know. May be it was some kind of a technical mistake. Anyway finally I got in and the rest of my journey and staying in the apartment was perfect.,It was very clean and comfortable. You can feel the apartment as your own home. I mean there was everything you need to cook. have meal. do dishes. wash clothes. watch TV. use Internet. etc.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Bill Zildjian,United States of America,15 Reviews,April 10  2017,6.7,Be alert! The details on how to get into the building are buried in the acknowledgment email. There is no one at the door waiting to help. I missed this critical email detail and went through 20 minutes of futile calls to voice-mail lines that were "full". After I got sorted out. I took another 15 minutes helping the next guest who was also adrift the exact same way. This would not have been possible to do if I hadn't been able to leave my car by the from door while figuring out how to get in.  Overall it's an excellent location. provided that there is not a Sox game going on (I knew ahead of time. and my stay was on an off-day). On game days. parking is twice the price and hard to find. and driving in the neighborhood is impossible.  If you are here on business. definitely avoid game days.,I am familiar with the location and had an easy time finding great restaurants. Price is terrific. Unbeatable lodging if you are here for a Red Sox game. especially if you can get your car parked early enough to avoid "game day" rates.

Evolve Fenway Diamond,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,April 8  2017,6.7,I checked into my room and then received an email saying my room was changed. We got switched to a smaller room that had smaller bedrooms and only 1 bathroom instead of two. We did not get any money back even though I paid for a big apartment and got a smaller one. Then two men were also booked for the same room and they were moved also. They said the apartment needed renovations. A little sketchy but the host was nice and explained everything. Cleaning service knocked on door ready to clean at 930am when check out was at 11am. They walked in at 11 on the dot. Never made eye contact or said hello. Rude. Other than that it was a good time.,Rooms were nice as was the host.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,April 5  2017,4.2,No staff to answer questions.

Evolve Fenway Diamond,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,March 22  2017,7.1,They tried to overcharge me ~15% as if the tax is not included from the final price I received; which does not comply with the Booking.com rule. I complained but they were non-responsive; Booking.com did a good job to refund me the overcharge.There is no check-in desk or whatsoever(it is an apartment without concierge). They notified that there would be  a key box with a password. which did not exist. The room door was left open and we found a key inside. Did not feel very secure.Location is great but very close to the subway track. If you are sensitive with noise at night. not the best choice.,N/A

Evolve Fenway Diamond,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,March 13  2017,8.3,There was no on-site parking and all street parking is reserved for residents with permits.  The only nearby public parking was $50.00/day.Got there and the lockbox  I was told to look for to get the keys had apparently fallen off the wall earlier in the day.  No one bothered to notify me in advance. but they were quite aware of it when I called.  I am not sure why they didn't take the initiative to reach out to me first. rather than making me try to figure out how to contact them after hours to gain access to the unit.I also did not like their policy about emailing a photo of my credit card prior to my arrival.  I had already paid for the room and refused give them a picture of my credit card by email. due to concerns about identity theft.I paid for a late check-out. but the housekeeper did not receive the memo.  She was nice. but just seemed really confused about not having been given that information.,Very comfortable for an extended stay.

Evolve Fenway Diamond,Philip_and_Roxanne,United States of America,8 Reviews,March 6  2017,8.3,It's hard to get a hold of anyone. This is really the only negative about the property. I was looking for an early check in and it took 4 emails and 2 phone calls to get an answer for an early check in. My other friend that rented another condo in the same building had an issue with getting the instructions from the Evolve company. Instructions on how to get in and what passcode to use to receive the room keys. Other than that the room experience was great.,I loved that the condo was located literally next door to Fenway Park.

Also. lack of parking for guests staying less than 30 days is also bothersome.,Excellent location. spacious units with all amenities imaginable present inside. A no-brainer for short or extended stay for families.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Nanette,United States of America,2 Reviews,January 1  2017,9.2,The cleaning staff was knocking on the door at 7 am to ask if we were leaving that morning while the check out wasn't until 11 am.  I have never experienced something that bizarre!!,N/A
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,December 30  2016,7.5,One mattress was broken and felt like a hammock. It was evident there was some flooding that occurred at some point and the floors and baseboards were damaged. Sleeps 6 but only had 4 towels.,Great value. Spacious. Easy and secure entry. Great location.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Ben,Taiwan,18 Reviews,December 29  2016,7.5,Toaster didn't work properly. the smoke of bread  triggered fire alarm. Hope it can be fixed soon.,It was interesting that there were no staff in the hotel.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Bonnie,United States of America,4 Reviews,December 9  2016,10,N/A,Tyler was very helpful even setting up uber and instructing me on how to use it.He also helped me with an issue with my reservation date. which was my mistake. I love Evolve. The apartments are very clean. centrally located and very homey.

Evolve Fenway Diamond,Jakob,Belgium,11 Reviews,December 5  2016,6.7,There was no personnel. I called the concierge several times nobody ever replied.,The cleaning woman was very helpful. The location was good. centrally located. Clean.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Donovan Johnson,United States of America,6 Reviews,December 3  2016,10,N/A,Erica and Felicia customer service is amazing. It is so outstanding and it is because of both Erica and Felicia why I recommended Boston University's Staff member. students and the Alumni Association to book  at this amazing facility.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Sarah,United States of America,3 Reviews,November 25  2016,7.9,Bathroom needs a shelf or vanity space for putting down basic things like toothbrushes.  Someone had left the TV on so when I first got to the apartment there was sound coming out. which is a little scary when you are traveling.  The thermostat and TV had preset  programs which made it difficult to reset. The thermostat ranged from 75-77 degrees most of the time. which is too warm for me. I was able to call to get advice but it would be better if they left instructions. No staff at the facility.,Location was fine for my meeting especially compared to the price of nearby hotels.  Apartment was clean and well-appointed in the kitchen if you wanted to cook.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Karen,United States of America,1 review,November 19  2016,7.9,I found a 'bug' on my bed as I was packing. I should've taken a picture before I flushed it (I was pretty wigged out and that was my immediate reaction). but it looked like a bed bug (after looking it up on my phone post-flush). I told the cleaning woman so she could take extra care in cleaning that room. I did not see any others and I went through all my stuff 2x (and again when I got home). Hoping it wasn't really and that if it was...it was just the one. Eek!,Great 'newer' facility...it's great to have a full kitchen and access to the fitness center. It's also great that it's located right near Fenway and the Fenway T stop!
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Christopher,United States of America,14 Reviews,November 18  2016,9.2,We never dealt with a live person. This was ok. but even when we did try to contact someone by email (which they recommended as an option). the reply was very slow in coming (2 days).   As an apartment rather than a hotel it was ok. but not as well stocked as I would have liked. Basics like toilet paper and salt and pepper were nowhere to be found.,Location was good as we were visiting a student at BU right near by. For other Boston activities it may not have been as central.  The place was large and new and clean and was a great jumping off point for our Boston activities.  Kitchen was good for some basic cooking and baking.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Weekend,United States of America,1 review,November 15  2016,7.9,Bed is very uncomfortable. Management group lacks professional polish. I received some very short responses from one associate with incomplete information to answer my questions.  Very strange and incomplete check out procedure. I still don't know if I checked out properly from last weekend.,Premium location near Fenway Park and plenty of restaurants.  Parking garage very close to building.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Noreen,Ireland,1 review,November 15  2016,9.2,The doors could open from inside no way of locking them with kids,The beds were extra. Comfy we had loads of storage space and the appartment overall was very spacious

Evolve Fenway Diamond,David,United Kingdom,54 Reviews,November 5  2016,9.5,The arrangement to pick up the key would have been fine if the lockable box (opened by a pin number) had not been faulty.No hairdryer.  No chopping board and only 2 knives.The arrangement was strange....taking a photograph of the key on the work surface to email.  We were unable to email the photograph.  Why not put the key back in the lockable box....when it is working!,Spacious apartment.Everything was new.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Patricia,Philippines,13 Reviews,October 31  2016,9.6,There was a problem with my booking. I originally had a bookings for Oct 26-29 and 26-30. and ended up keeping and confirming the Oct 26-30.  But a week before I arrived. they confirmed the Oct 26-29 for a 2 bedroom.  After clearing up the confusion. we agreed on a transfer to a 1-bedroom for our last night. which was an inconvenience.  The transfer disrupted our schedule for the last day and we were 4. so a 1 bedroom was tight.  It just worked out because we left close to midnight of our last night.  The staff was very apologetic and helpful though. which made me calm down ğŸ˜Š,Location. Cleanliness. new and modern apartment
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Nigel,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,October 29  2016,8.3,No instructions on how to change the air con and it ws pretty noisy - we are not used to air con at gome.Also the toilet blocked on first evening but this was resolved the next day whilst we were out.,Nice location close to Fenway on the Green Line D route.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Carla,United Kingdom,9 Reviews,October 27  2016,3.8,We were contacted on the day of travel to say that the booking was cancelled.  An error their end which took a long time to sort out.  On arrival there were no pillow cases and not sufficient bedding for four.  There was a broken chair upturned and left in the kitchen and broken smoke alarms.  The toaster didn't work and nor did the telly in the main bedroom.  There was no kettle.  Although we attempted to contact immediately regarding these problems. no one got back to us during our visit and the first thing we had to do was go out and buy bedding!  I would never use this facility again.,The apartment was in itself lovely and very spacious.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Maria,Venezuela,3 Reviews,October 26  2016,9.6,We had to leave in a rush at 11:00am. The lady open our door at 10:40am to urge us to leave. I was in a wheel chair because a previous accident and it really was very very uncomfortable. My husband was really upset and wanted to make a complain to your company.,The place was spacious and very confortable.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Michael,United States of America,17 Reviews,October 25  2016,7.1,The bed is AWFUL!  A 'small' queen but sags badly in the middle.  The shower/tub floor can be quite slippery and we didn't find a rubber bathmat.  Highly recommend to add non-slip tape in the tub.,Great location!  An easy walk to the Fenway T-stop.  Recently built apartment complex. washer/dryer combo and kitchenette are convenient amenities.  Quiet apartment building even though next to the T tracks.  Pretty good value for size of the accommodations and location.Not much communication with the staff. in fact you never talk to or see anyone in the whole transaction.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Mark,United States of America,4 Reviews,October 24  2016,5.0,Very skimpy supplies. Bed was supposed to be queen. it was a double.  Couch very               uncomfortable. Fire suppressant system sprang leak in middle of night in bathroom.  Little usability for long period... no refund?,Location
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Laila,Belgium,2 Reviews,October 18  2016,5.8,The sofabed was very uncomfortable. my daughter could not sleep on it. There was no concierge on site. So you could not leave your luggage until you could check in. Even 1 hour before 16.00. was 75 dollar extra. and also there was no late checkout or possibility to leave luggage. Also the tv in the bedroom did not work. Very difficult to get hold of somebody when arriving. the phone nr on the outside of building. they say they have nothing to do with booking.com. So I will never choose to stay there again!!!,N/A

Evolve Fenway Diamond,Dipti,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,October 17  2016,7.9,The day of arrival got an impolite email saying the card was declined and so the room was not guaranteed for us. There was no person to greet at the door but we called the number and was told how to get in. We had requested a cot but wasnt provided any details beforehand. We called up for them to tell us it was 100dollar fwlivery charge and 25 dollar/night hire. All other trips we have never had to hire a cot. The bed is super uncomfortable,The apartment was really big and spacious and had all the facilities needed. Felt like being at home.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Ruathy,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,October 17  2016,4.6,There was no duvet for the sofa bed only a blanket and there was no hairdryer. Also the kitchen could have done with more than 1 large pan.,great layout of apartment &amp; very central
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Omri,Israel,2 Reviews,October 7  2016,5.4,One of the beds was broken which resulted in a large bowl like dent inthe mattress. resulted in a poor night sleep. Nobody answered in the socalled 24/7 phone service. When eventually someone answered to ane-mail they just said someone will come over without saying when. Noanswer to the followup email asking when. Needless to say no one showedup. We had to sleep on the floor!!! Terrible service!!,Spacious. clean
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Debra,United States of America,1 review,October 5  2016,8.3,We had no contact with any staff the whole weekend.  There was no extra blanket in the apartment but there was not one single person around to ask about it.  We just turned up the heat!The mattress could be replaced.  It was sagging in the center.Wine glasses would be nice.,It was spotless and very clean.  I really appreciated that most of all.The location was great.  It was an easy walk to Fenway and the subway.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Michael,United States of America,1 review,October 4  2016,7.9,No actual staff on hand if any issues arose. no convenient parking however we didn't rent a car since it is very easy to get around the city via subway.,Within easy walking distance of Fenway Park and the subway.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,twochicos,Canada,9 Reviews,October 4  2016,9.6,Bathroom fan needs to be cleaned...it's a bit fuzzy. Only 2 spoons and 2 bowls. Laundry room light stays in for quite an extended period of time. and the light can be disruptive to sleep.,Excellent location. easy walking distance to shops. restaurants and Fenway Park. Transportation is steps away. Clean. comfortable. Perfect for 2 couples.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Lourde,Ireland,2 Reviews,October 4  2016,8.3,Aircon in one apartment was not working and while emailed got no response . Also requested duvet for pullout bed and no response ... No onsite person to contact. esp at weekend . No hairdryer. Local info would be helpful as in where T station . grocery store . hairdressers etc . Small things which could have made stay excellent instead of good !,Overall apartments spacious and good layout . Exercise room a bonus . Good location .. Near T station . amenities etc
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Bachelorette,United States of America,4 Reviews,September 27  2016,7.9,Communication with staff was pretty horrendous. I'd called and sent numerous emails before someone got back to me. Actually. I used the online chat function to send an email and that's what got me a response. After that. Erica was pretty helpful. It took a while to get my questions answered but at the end of the day. they were answered. Probably not with a smile but that's OK. The apts came with 1 roll of toilet paper for each bathroom and that's really not enough. Oh also. weird red lights in the vents above the toilets. Called maintenance to ask what is was but surprise. no one got back to me. Got over our fears but it would have been nice to get a phone call. The beds are not that great. especially the sofa bed.,The apartments were in a fabulous location and large enough that 6 women fit comfortably in a 2 BDRM. 2 BATHS was a huge hit too. Nice spacious bathrooms allowed for multiple people to get ready all at once. Also. thanks for using the lockbox for the keys. Made everything simpler.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Anonymous,Australia,45 Reviews,September 24  2016,6.7,It was claimed that credit card did not work. Not correct as it worked when we arrived. No one to meet us and no working phone contact. Cleaner very helpful.  Process for leaving key very unusual.,Location and comfort

Evolve Fenway Diamond,Michael,Germany,12 Reviews,September 21  2016,7.9,On arrival we could not obtain our key and had some trouble contacting an employee as there is no permanent stuff in the building. However. the problem was fixed efficiently after we were able to contact someone.More annoying were some details in the apartment. For example:- Bathroom doors close very noisy.- The automatic lights in the closet equipped with movement sensors turn off too late and there is no switch to do this manually- carpets are in the way of opening and closing doors between the rooms. Unfortunately. beds are also on the carpets so that moving them is not easily possible.These issues can all easily be fixed and if they are. the apartment should be excellent. It's all very new and has the potential to be very comfortable. Area around is convenient and safe.The bed couch is very uncomfortable. The beds are okay.,Optimal value for the price. Excellent kitchen and apartments are very well isolated.
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Edward,United States of America,6 Reviews,September 20  2016,7.5,Bed in master bed room was shot. Sagged in the middle and squeaked with every move.  Should have demanded a discount but since it was an apartment no one to complain to .,N/A
Evolve Fenway Diamond,Harmony,United States of America,1 review,September 15  2016,5.8,When we arrive our room was not the size we requested. and the room was still filthy from the renters before us. Old pizza boxes. dirty sheets. and half drank beer cans on the table. When we called about the room they told us they'd call us back. When they did not do that. we called again and were told their housekeeper had an emergency and someone would be there shortly. When the housekeepers arrive they worked quickly. I was told I would get my early check in deposit back. but even after multiple emails I have not seen the money.I would prefer in the future to pay the extra money for the type of guarantee you; but is only really possible in a hotel where there are people there to hold accountable. The only people we saw were the two housekeepers and a group of people moving in to another apartment.,We were going to a concert and the ballpark. It's walking distance from Fenway and all the bars and restaurants in the area.
Courtyard Boston-South Boston,Scott,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 9  2017,6.3,I was not apprised if parking costs. and waited 40 minutes for shuttle at T station. when I was told 15 minutes.

Courtyard Boston-South Boston,Mary,Canada,4 Reviews,August 31  2017,6.7,No blow dryer in the room  - also the sign from the parking lot indicating a one way street is not visible - and is upside down - very dangerous  as  out of town traveller's could make a wrong turn - very expensive for the location,N/A
Courtyard Boston-South Boston,vernmochila,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 22  2017,6.7,For the type of hotel and the price that we paid. I expected better organization with my check in and check out.  Upon arrival around 4-5 pm (with my uncle). our room still wasn't ready - and the front desk sent us upstairs to a room that was totally unclean.  We had to come back down and explain my situation. and they apologized profusely and said they were out of double rooms but offered us a King bed with a sofa and a 50 dollar discount.  We moved into that room and then received a call saying that since I prepaid they couldn't offer us a rebate (didn't really understand the logic but okay)...so in about half an hour they moved us into another double bed room that became available (so out 2nd move in an hour).  They offered us free breakfast (a nice gesture but definitely not equitable to the discount) and we asked the manager for a free late check out due the situation - he agreed and said we could check out at 2.30 PM.  We had a good rest of the stay and a good night. and the next day around 12.30 pm. other guests came to our room and were able to open the door with their card keys while we were in the room.  They were shocked. as you would imagine. and I tried to call the front desk to explain the situation and they never picked up.  I went downstairs upon check out and explained the situation to the same manager and he apologized but it was obvious he didn't even remember offering us the late check out nor did he do anything about it.The location is great in terms of convenience to downtown/south end Boston. it's a quick &amp; cheap taxi/uber (kind of out of the way if taking the T). but the neighborhood itself is pretty barren; it's an urban mid-range corporate hotel but has the feel of a highway exit chain hotel due to the location.  The only thing close by is a huge suburban type shopping plaza that has more appeal to minivan moms than travelers (mostly big box stores).,The room itself was comfortable; the beds were very comfortable; the staff was polite. friendly. and patient; restaurant modern &amp; welcoming.  Basically. standard quality for a corporate mid range urban hotel.

It was really easy to drive from the Adams Houses. MFA. and The Freedom Trail. This was my first trip to Boston and I was really surprised how centrally located this hotel was to all of the things I was there to see. It was also great to have a parking lot having driven there. The parking garages in Boston were also plentiful and easy to find. even being there close to the 4th of July. The hotel was clean comfortable and the staff was really friendly. A++

When I arrived from London a very long trip with ashes from my husband. I called the hotel and they told me it would cost me $75.00 to get a ride. So I got a taxi for $40.00. When I got to the hotel they said to me they don.t know who i called. So for my trouble they gave me a free ride to the airport worth $5.00.

Courtyard Boston-South Boston,Helen,United Kingdom,40 Reviews,April 8  2017,6.7,Location is good if you need parking. but a bit soulless and on the same site as a huge shopping mall. and near a big busy road. Room was quiet enough though. Rather 'mean' with the toiletries. considering it's not a cheap hotel - barely enough shampoo for one. let alone two; no shower gel. only soap. And a coffee maker for one cup - surely a double room should have a coffee machine for two.,Comfy room with large bed. Helpful staff.

Courtyard Boston-South Boston,Emma,United Kingdom,1 review,September 27  2016,5.8,Alarm clock went off at midnight - seems to be a common prank in Boston so check the alarm clock. Only 1 set of shower gel/shampoo between the 2 of us. Not very environmentally friendly (attach bottles to the wall would be better). Allegedly there were minibuses to take you to the underground/ into Boston but even though we saw them there weren't drivers (easy to walk to metro though). Don't bother with the swimming pool - it's so tiny you can't even do one stroke.,Decent size room with comfortable bed

Courtyard Boston-South Boston,Kandarpkumar,Spain,10 Reviews,August 28  2016,7.5,The only minus about this property is the location. It's a bit far from Boston downtown and it's in the 'tough' neighborhood of Dorchester. If you are traveling with kids than maybe it would be a bit inconvenient.,This is a very nice property. People are extremely nice and helpful. We were wonderfully treated and helped by all. However Odaire. who was on the night duty. was extremely helpful. Late in night when we had troubles with the washing machine. he was extremely helpful.

The area to eat wasn't great.  Prefer a hotel will an actual restaurant or that offers a comp breakfast.  Not a Starbucks fan.,We like the location near the T. the pool (could have been a little cleaner). room was clean and staff was very friendly. I liked the quite from 10-7 policy as well.  Beds were comfortable.
Courtyard Boston-South Boston,Carol,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 30  2016,8.3,Paid too much--had to incur cab fare 4 times to get back and forth to main area of Boston AND shuttle service was basically non existent!! At least offer shuttle service to popular attractions or areas like Quincy Market or the Aquarium. I will not be back!!,Room was comfy and staff were nice and helpful.
Courtyard Boston-South Boston,Tired,United States of America,1 review,July 27  2016,5.8,I paid for a room with two queen beds. When we arrived at 11 pm from the airport we were told there weren't anymore rooms available with two queens and I showed them my receipt from Booking.com but there was little they could do at that point. We ended up with the only room available which was a king with a small sofa bed- and not enough room to pull it out. We put the mattress on the floor and one teen curled up on couch cushions. They gave us a coupon for free breakfast but it didn't make up for lost sleep after a long flight.,The receptionist was as helpful as he could be inspite of the circumstances. The room was clean and quiet. Free parking.
Courtyard Boston-South Boston,William,United States of America,6 Reviews,July 17  2016,8.8,Breakfast was not included and there were no adequate eating places close by.  Questioned safety walking back to the motel after dark from the T.  Very small pool.,Desk and cleaning staff were very pleasant and hotel was attractive.
Courtyard Boston-South Boston,Lorfi,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,July 4  2016,6.7,The location!,beds and pillows very comfortable. TV easy to use and room very nice. however we did not like the location as we had to get the T to downtown Boston. we had thought the hotel was only a short walk from Boston downtown but it wasn't. Andrew T station is 5 mins away but make sure you go the correct way don't try and access this via the shopping mall behind the hotel.The best way to do this is by getting instructions from staff I think we turned right when leaving the hotel and this was a hassle free way to get to the T. The shopping mall has a chemist etc so handy but a bit creepy after dark!
Courtyard Boston-South Boston,Kristen,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 22  2016,9.2,No microwave!,Front desk staff was very helpful with recommendations for restaurants. etc. housekeeping was also very accommodating with extra towels and the room was very clean. Bistro in the lobby was yummy.
Courtyard Boston-South Boston,Rafael,Brazil,32 Reviews,June 17  2016,9.2,They forgot to give us towels twice (only three for four people). We left a note for the chambermaid to leave four towels. and then the issue was solved. Telephone was not working.,Good space to park. There is a department centre nearby with a supermarket. stores and restaurants. Walkable distance to subway. Room facilities are good (coffee machine. fridge).
Courtyard Boston-South Boston,Iris,United States of America,1 review,May 25  2016,9.6,Desk clerk forgot to get authorization when I checked in at night which made my check out a bit confusing and time consuming. Also someone on my hall was smoking in their room and the smell of smoke was everywhere.  The front desk was informed of this and they did send someone to check.,The desk staff was courteous. The cafe staff and meal were outstanding.
Courtyard Boston-South Boston,iceylove,United States of America,33 Reviews,May 24  2016,7.5,No microwaves! The pillow is too low that made my friend sick. Afraid to go outside at night if no car.,Location is ok. walkable to metro. Room is nice big clean with full height window.
Courtyard Boston-South Boston,Frederic,Canada,2 Reviews,May 20  2016,8.8,Our room was by the elevator and we could hear constant dings.  Also the entrance to the hotel is kind of hard to find and navigate to.,The bed was super comfortable. the room was ultra clean. and the staff was very friendly.  The shower was hot and powerful.  It was easy and free to park.  There was a pool and a café.
Courtyard Boston-South Boston,Andrew,United States of America,1 review,April 29  2016,7.5,N/A,We arrived around 10:30 pm and discovered the hotel was over booked.  The manager handled it well and booked us in the Holiday Inn next door for free.  This is the first time I had this issue with a hotel and it was handled well.
Courtyard Boston-South Boston,David,United Kingdom,16 Reviews,March 11  2016,8.8,Parking was tricky when we arrived as there was a conference but duty manager came out and found somewhere that wasn't an official space but said it was on to park.Deli restaurant was small and struggled to cope at breakfast although food was okay when it arrived.,Easy access from airport and easy to get into Boston on the underground which is about 8 mind walk from hotel.
Courtyard Boston-South Boston,Paul,United States of America,3 Reviews,February 17  2016,9.6,Pricey for a 1 night stay. but price would be ok. if it were not for the Parking... it's not good. particularly when the temperature was below 0. I parked closer to the RT 93 exit and Holiday Inn Express. Hmmm... thought about going into HI instead. Place needs more parking and better signage for roads to and from the hotel. Since. I'm from the SB area. I knew how to navigate.,The people that work there were pleasant and helpful.
Courtyard Boston-South Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,January 10  2016,5.8,The "Quiet Hours" that started at 10pm were definitely not enforced.

Room was relatively clean as well however ceiling in bathroom has never had any cleaning attention
Courtyard Boston-South Boston,Zeynep,United States of America,1 review,December 1  2015,9.6,It doesn't have breakfast include the price.,It was very clean and all staff were very friendly and kind. It has great location which is close to subway and shopping mall.
Courtyard Boston-South Boston,Glen,United States of America,3 Reviews,December 1  2015,7.5,We did not like the fact that finding the hotel in the dark was next to impossible at first as the address is 63 R Boston St and it's easy enough to find Boston St.  There are no signs on Boston St itself to direct you where R Boston St is or where the hotel is.   If you see the sign "Car Wash. you make a right; however there is no info on this on their web site.   This made finding the hotel next to impossible.,Once we learned where the hotel was (which was the next day) after we almost got lost finding it; the hotel was okay.  It is actually walking distance to the "Red Line Subway Station" Andrew Square.  The hotel also has a shopping center around the corner by walking through a few parking lots; however not too far.   The hotel also offers a complimentary shuttle to the subway station.

Midtown Hotel,Roger,United States of America,11 Reviews,October 21  2017,6.3,The room was warm and there was no air conditioning or even a ventilation fan running — this was mid October. mild weather. Room safe didn’t work (low battery) and it took 3 phone calls and well over an hour for someone to come and fix it. so I could finally go out for dinner.,Good price compared to other hotels in the area.
Midtown Hotel,Anonymous,Canada,2 Reviews,October 21  2017,7.5,Poor lighting in bathroom.,It was a great location. staff were very friendly and helpful. hotel room and lobby were clean. bed was comfortable. It was not a four star hotel but great value for money in Boston's extremely high priced Hotel Market.Hotel arranged a shuttle to airport. it was very prompt and professional.
Midtown Hotel,Dale,New Zealand,44 Reviews,October 21  2017,7.9,Hotel is a little tired in places however that is reflected in the price.   Boston is an expensive city for hotel stays.    Breakfast is not included.,Hotel staff were efficient and friendly.      They were very obliging with our 1.15am arrival.   Easy walking to the Back Bay area.    Just two blocks to the Prudential Centre.   Parking available.
Midtown Hotel,Alexandra,Netherlands,8 Reviews,October 21  2017,6.3,No breakfast available; to reach the elevator you had to climb a few stairs with your luggage; poor lighting in the room; small double bed,Central location with public transport and restaurants and shops nearby; very friendly &amp; helpful staff
Midtown Hotel,Liz,New Zealand,14 Reviews,October 20  2017,5.8,The property was very tired. The air conditioning was not working so the rooms were very hot. Not favourable for sleeping. Towels would be taken each day but not always replaced.,Midtown was located in an excellent position. Close to subway and in walking distance to most places. Size of the rooms were excellent.
Midtown Hotel,Jahmai,United States of America,1 review,October 19  2017,7.1,The hotel itself is dated. in need of refurbishment. and has a bizarre layout. You need to use stairs to reach the elevator on the first floor. which was awkward for us. as we had a baby stroller in addition to our luggage. Furthermore. the staff was inexcusably slow at fulfilling a simple request for a crib. We initially requested it upon check-in. and after three calls. we finally got it - half an hour past midnight. They knocked and asked if we needed blankets twenty minutes later. To reiterate. they gave us the crib we requested in the afternoon AFTER MIDNIGHT. and knocked. preventing us from sleeping. at nearly one A.M.,The Midtown has a decent location. near the green line. shopping. and dining. It is relatively inexpensive for its location.
Midtown Hotel,Jon,United States of America,1 review,October 18  2017,7.5,Walls are paper thin. could hear everything going on in the hallways and parking lot.,Location and price were perfect for visiting the local colleges.  Staff was very friendly.
Midtown Hotel,Wei,Australia,6 Reviews,October 17  2017,10,N/A,great location. close to museum. cheesecake factory. Quincy market. freedom trail and China town.

Midtown Hotel,Leila,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 7  2017,8.8,Temperature in room not always comfortable.,Clerk at front desk was extraordinarily helpful with a personal issue.  Most helpful of any clerk at any hotel at which I have stayed.
Midtown Hotel,Paul,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,October 6  2017,8.3,Arrangement of paired bathroom units between bedrooms means that plumbing noises from adjacent rooms can be quite loud.  Decor in communal areas and corridors is a bit tired. dark and nondescript. but rooms are brighter and better.,Good sized rooms. handy location for Back Bay. John Hynes Convention Center + Prudential Tower (under 5 mins walk).  Friendly and helpful staff. Coke &amp; ice machines on each floor. but no bar or restaurant.  Thorntons Restaurant just 2 mins walk from hotel is a great mom + pop style diner for breakfasts and lunches.
Midtown Hotel,Rana,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 5  2017,2.5,I don't even know where to start. People at the desk super rude. They didn't have toothbrush or anything in the rooms and when we asked for it they said they would bring it hours later no one came. Then in the morning someone tried to come into our room open the door. Good thing we had the door locked with the chain lock. To top everything I forgot my Clarisonic face washing machine in the bathroom along with my face wash and shampoos. I don't really care for face wash and shampoos but the Clarisonic is worth about 150 dollars. So when I realized what happened couple days after and called them they told me they didn't find it?! I mean its not like I forgot a piece of paper. I forgot an electronic device in the room. So they told me to call again I called 3 times after that talked to house keeping supervisor. She told me she would look and talk to people who cleaned the room and give me a call took my number and everything. I never received a call. Never staying there again.,Only thing I like was the bed.
Midtown Hotel,Wendy,Canada,2 Reviews,September 28  2017,7.9,It would have been nice to have a mini-fridge in room.,It was a less expensive hotel in a great location. easy to get around from here.

Midtown Hotel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,12 Reviews,September 24  2017,6.7,It's a very dated hotel. which is actually more like a motel. Rooms were a bit dark. including the bathroom. Air conditioning was fairly loud. There was also a lot of building work going on at the time we visited. so quite noisy in the morning. The surrounding area is safe. although it's a bit of a walk to anything worth seeing or visiting. It feels like the kind of place you might spend one night in as part of a road trip. if your trip included going to the centre of Boston.Overall. it was fine. but very expensive for what it was.,Staff were nice. hotel was clean. reasonably need to public transport.
Midtown Hotel,Caroline,United Kingdom,1 review,September 23  2017,5.0,Hotel is very tired and old. The photos look far better than the actual rooms/facilities are. Staff very helpful but quality of the hotel is poor. Found it quite a depressing place to stay for three nights.,N/A

Midtown Hotel,William Page,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 22  2017,7.5,Cons wifi did not work and room was small.

Perfect hotel for a Sox game.
Midtown Hotel,Valter,Netherlands,7 Reviews,August 16  2017,7.5,A microwave oven might be a plus. The soap in the bathroom was not enough for 4 people. Same stuff for the coffee capsule. always 3 pieces for 4 people.,The room was really large.
Midtown Hotel,Idalina,United States of America,1 review,August 16  2017,9.6,Overall everything was great but there was a little confusion with the parking as far as do we pay for parking or is it included with this day? When we first checked in one employee said that we would have to pay for parking when we checked out but when I checked out we were told we did not have to pay for parking .,The location was great and the staff was very helpful and happy.
Midtown Hotel,Larry,United States of America,1 review,August 16  2017,8.8,Bathroom was awkward -- it seems a door for the sink &amp; toilet/shower would be prudent instead of a door to the toilet/shower -- limited space !!!!,The location of the Midtown Hotel was exceptional for my purposes.
Midtown Hotel,Ursula,Ireland,12 Reviews,August 15  2017,9.2,No bar or coffee shop in the hotel.,Location was fantastic. Great value for money. Pool was a bonus.Proximity to T makes this a great location. Staff very friendly and helpful.
Midtown Hotel,John,United Kingdom,10 Reviews,August 14  2017,7.5,rooms are basic and decor dated,Retro hotel in the centre of Boston. Only 15 minutes walk to Fenway park - we walked back from the match at 11pm and the neighbourhood felt safe and lively. Room are a bit basic and cleanliness is not 3* but thats mainly due to the age of the decor. Ice maker and soft drinks dispensers in the corridors. The outdoor pool is great. well shielded from wind and completely private from outside the hotel (room back onto the pool)
Midtown Hotel,Boston,Australia,7 Reviews,August 14  2017,5.8,No on site eating facilities. Arrived early evening from overseas and then had to go out and find place to eat. In near vicinity only fast food outlets. Very disappointing considering price price paid for room. No breakfast either.,N/A

Midtown Hotel,Alfredo,Spain,12 Reviews,August 7  2017,3.8,The hotel is old. the staff not very friendly. We left the room in the morning and came back around 15.30. the room wasn't made up.  I run into a maid and asked her if she could do the room for us; her answer was plainly "No. I'm going home". For 250 USD a night.

Midtown Hotel,Isabelle,Canada,1 review,July 23  2017,9.2,The insonorisation of the rooms are poor.

We where disapointed and incommodated with the noise.The pool was open from 10am to 8pm it is a little short.,The staff was very kind. the room was clean and decorated with taste.The hotel is two corners walking to the train (that can carry you up everywhere in Boston)

Midtown Hotel,Suzanne,United States of America,1 review,July 10  2017,9.2,The room was a bit older than the photos suggested. Fluorescent lighting in the bathroom was not personally appealing.

Midtown Hotel,Manuel,Colombia,10 Reviews,July 7  2017,6.3,The hotel was old. smelled funny. and definitely didn't look like the photos. The housekeeper came at 7:30am and as we were still inside we asked to come later. and this never happened. so we don't have our room cleaned. (The answer from the front desk to this was absolutely ridiculous).,Perfect location. The beds and pillows very good.

Midtown Hotel,Elizabeth,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 6  2017,5.4,The pool was closed in July (the summer!) The "concierge" didn't know where main tourist areas were. He seemed clueless.

We called the front desk twice for towels and soap and even 3 hours later we still had not received hem.Overall. they just seemed confused and not organized.The decr is from the 70's and low quality.

Midtown Hotel,Jerry,Netherlands,68 Reviews,June 11  2017,7.9,The hotel already exists for many years; they did refurbish and it looks ''OK". but it could have beendone so much nicer.

Midtown Hotel,Dimitrios,Greece,14 Reviews,May 22  2017,7.5,The hotel is rather old. the you can see that by walking through the hall from the reception to the elevator. The staff was friendly besides one or two people that were not very helpfull. You had to log in to the wi-fi again. from every device. every single day. The rooms were clean. but not every part of the hall way.  Some TV chanels suddenly froze while you were watching.,The hotel is very close to 3 subway stations. About 5-10 minutes from each one. so you can easily go to any part of Boston. The double rooms have enough space for two people. the toiletries were satiisfying and their were pleanty of power sockets for all your electric devices. The bed was quite comfertable. There was a room to store your luggage after check-out.
Midtown Hotel,Uri,Israel,16 Reviews,May 18  2017,6.7,First thing - Hotel feels very old (and not old in a good way). feels like an hotel from the 60s.  there was rust in the room pipes. no heating or cooling option - I had to change my room because of two reasons: first room I got was too noisy (there are no isolated glasses on this hotel - you can hear people talking on the street). and second the room was too hot (even though it was 50 degrees outside - there was a direct sunlight and no cooling option). the bath tab was a disaster and dangerous. while standing in it it felt like it going to break every second. The room was very expensive to the overall experience I had. I expected much better then that and was very disappointed.,Location is great. and the hotel has it own parking space
Midtown Hotel,Adm,United States of America,1 review,May 13  2017,10,N/A,Today 05/13 around lunch time I got in to the hotel for my second time stay. I was checked in by the Marc hotel manager​ who was one of the rare people who treated me greatly and respectfully without care of my budget pocket.  because I was coming from the MGH. so he's the best since the date of my arrival in EUA(02/29/2015 NY) . I am 22 years old business administration professional graduated in Brazil in 2015. getting out of an accident job on 04/30/2017. so I really do Know a little bit of what I am talking about and my needs for the moment. Totally worth any penny or tip.Just my thank you so much and lifetime appreciation to Midtown Hotel Family. Kisses of light.
Midtown Hotel,Dr,United States of America,1 review,May 7  2017,7.5,When I arrived the desk manager  (I think his name was Mike B.) said he could not find my reservation that I has made through Booking.com. I did have The Booking.com confirmation sheet with the reservation number and the pin number. He kept complaining about booking .com and kept me waiting 40 minutes at the counter while he said he was trying to get in contact with Booking .com. I had just driven up from the Newport RI area to go to my son's NU graduation  the next day (Fri). I was very tired and he got me extremely stressed because I did know if I would have a place to stay. I had made the reservation on Feb 28th to make sure I would be able to get a reservation close to NU. This man got me very.very upset! The rest of the staff was very nice especially Youness S. who was at the desk on Sat. He had to correct my bill because it did not have the Booking.com rate.He did this very nicely in around 5 minutes or less.,Close to the Northeastern University graduation site..
Midtown Hotel,Debbie,United States of America,1 review,April 26  2017,5.0,Some staff were rude when asked questions or followed up for room service. Quality of the hotel is going down. Refrigerators are now rental and cost extra and you only get one trash bin per room (that's shared between bathroom and bedroom).,The room we had was more spacious than we though it would be. but we also payed for an extra fold out bed in the room so I dont know if space varies per room.
Midtown Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,April 17  2017,8.3,Hotel is a bit run-down. but clean and very conveniently located.  If you're out enjoying the town. it's all fine.,For visiting downtown college campuses. location was excellent.  Northeastern. Berklee walking distance. others a short ride away.  T stop close by.Boston Museum of Fine Arts right up the street.  Beds were comfortable. rooms quiet. no big problems.  Staff was friendly. helpful.Parking very convenient. in covered lot behind the hotel.
Midtown Hotel,Terry,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,April 16  2017,7.5,Two main problems: most of the time the wifi was poor or even not working in our room. Staff blamed the weather or too many people accessing it. Not a satisfactory explanation.. To their credit. the manager gave a 10% discount on room rate for this inconvenience. The other problem was other guests not understanding that a hotel is where people sleep. and several nights were disturbed. There were a number of what seemed to be families and groups of friends who talked loudly and banged doors at night and early morning. A polite notice from management on arrival - or a notice in the hallways - might help this.,The hotel has no catering. though there is a good breakfast place 5 minutes walk away. and a 7/11 nearby. The location is excellent. staff helpful. and the room large and comfortable. The hallways are a bit drab. but the room was fine - large and comfortable.
Midtown Hotel,Gavin,Canada,1 review,April 8  2017,7.5,Not really anything worth while close to hotel. that we found interesting.  But it was really rainy so we didn't explore too far away,Close to the Amtrak station in Back Bay. Walking distance to Fenway.
Midtown Hotel,Con,Ireland,1 review,April 6  2017,9.6,Heating System could be a litttle bit noisy at night?,Great location. Great room. Friendly staff.

Midtown Hotel,Henry,United States of America,3 Reviews,April 6  2017,7.9,Did not like to have to go out for food. Would have been nice to have a place to at least have breakfast.,I liked the location and the size and cleanliness of the room.
Midtown Hotel,Georges,Canada,1 review,March 13  2017,8.8,Room was on 1st level just in front of the main street and we would hear all the music from the cars passing even though windows were closed. We barely had a small dribble of water coming down from the tab of the sink!,The approach at the Front Desk was very friendly but professional. The cleaniness of the room. And no surprises: we got what we expetced. Hotel was at short walking distance from our interests!
Midtown Hotel,Melissa,United States of America,5 Reviews,March 6  2017,8.3,Walls were paper thin. which was only a problem due to domestic disputes going on in the room next door in the middle of both nights I stayed.,Location was perfect for Back Bay activities. Bed was comfortable and staff were friendly.
Midtown Hotel,Tereza,Czech Republic,1 review,March 6  2017,8.3,There was no wifi in the room and it smells like cigarettes when we arrived although it was non-smoking room,Good location and room was very nice and tidy.

Midtown Hotel,Christine,Canada,1 review,February 28  2017,6.3,Our non-smoking room smelled like smoke. so we had to keep the window open at all times we were in the room (there are no screens on the windows).,The location was amazing. and the staff was super helpful (especially in recommending the best pizza we've ever had)
Midtown Hotel,Mainer,United States of America,1 review,February 12  2017,8.8,The elevator was really small and really cold. Also. the staff. while really helpful. were really grumpy and assumed because we were drunk that we were disorderly. Also. our room was conjoined with another room and due to the door not being completely sealed. we disrupted another customer when we got back from bar hopping.,The shower had excellent water pressure and the bathtub was a really nice size. Our room also had a really nice view of the park next to the Prudential center.
Midtown Hotel,James,United States of America,1 review,February 8  2017,10,There was nothing else.,More than anything else the staff was extremely helpful and friendly I can say that I really liked that.parking lot was spacious and easy to use.

Midtown Hotel,katrina kalamar,United States of America,3 Reviews,December 19  2016,10,N/A,I go to school at Northeastern and this is the closet hotel to campus.

Midtown Hotel,James,United States of America,7 Reviews,December 14  2016,8.8,Although I was aware in advance the fact that there was no breakfast even muffins juice was a disappointment.,This hotel was extremely comfortable and quiet. The staff were most helpful and courteous.
Midtown Hotel,Sulaiman,United States of America,6 Reviews,December 14  2016,8.8,No breakfast. air conditioning takes too much time to heat up the room.,Walking distance to downtown. a lot of restaurants nearby. Shopping center ( prudential) one block away. great bed and pillows.
Midtown Hotel,Jonathan,United Kingdom,1 review,December 11  2016,6.3,Would actually call it a Motel.It was built in 1950s. so has no bar or restaurant. so no breakys either.Also the water pipes made noises &amp; the soundproofing very poor.,No what I expected. but a good location.
Midtown Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,19 Reviews,November 27  2016,7.9,Although wifi code was provided. wifi connection never reached our room. Either or both microwave and refrigerator would have been big plus as there were not so many places to eat in the neighborhood.,Bed mattress was comfortably soft. I really liked it! Also a big dining table was a good equipment. Guy at the front kindly accepted my request of ticket printing out of computer.
Apartments on Harrison Avenue,Steven,United Kingdom,1 review,September 26  2017,9.0,The bed is only a double whereas a king would be better because there is loads of room. Also the bedding and pillows need to be better quality and the duvet needs a cover not just loose sheets. 2more pillows would have been good. Information about the city would be a bonus as well as how to work the appliances/tv.  although we got a very quick response to our request when we were struggling with the tv and managed to figure it out.,The apartment is close to the centre of Bostons attractions and amenities. It is lovely and spacious and was spotless on arrival.
Apartments on Harrison Avenue,Jcb,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,August 10  2017,7.9,This particular apartment overlooks the highway AND train line so despite the double glazing. it is noisy.Also because this area is currently undergoing huge building &amp; redevelopment work. it feels a bit remote. Not quite reached 'up &amp; coming' yet!,The apartment is ultra modern&amp; very well kitted out. It's also just above Wholefoods so foood shopping is very easy .
Apartments on Harrison Avenue,Gaby,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,August 8  2017,10,Washing machine only worked on the 40 minute setting. Also couldnt contact the owner as didnt have details. Apartment description said there was balcony but there was no balcony.,Great pool!

Apartments on Harrison Avenue,Chris,Australia,38 Reviews,April 28  2017,5.8,A double bed; check-in at 4:00pm was ridiculous; only one key to apartment; not being given apartment number at time of confirmation front counter were not aware of our apartment number; dealing with Sonder Vincent was not helpful at all as we were traveling from Australia with lots of baggage and had to wait at the Fresh food market next door until our apartment was cleaned 3 hours later no earlier check-in was available apparently ☹; the apartment was not cleaned when we finnaly got to go inside as the rug in the lounge area was covered in dog hair.,Location. modern facilities and the helpful desk staff. The fresh food market next door was excellent.
Apartments on Harrison Avenue,John,Australia,2 Reviews,April 15  2017,7.9,A little noisy being so close to the major arterial roads and under the flight path.

The WholeFoods market downstairs was super convenient and had everything we needed. :)
Apartments on Harrison Avenue,Jennifer,United States of America,3 Reviews,April 14  2017,8.8,I considered two listings on Booking.com which had the options to cancel with full refund.  However. when I booked this property and another property from the same company. full payment was taken immediately for both. in which the property then indicated no refund is available after 24 to 48 hours.  It took several phone calls to remedy the situation.  Buyer beware!  You need to be specific when booking through a third party and call the property company directly to find out what the policy is with cancellations and refunds.  This will save you time. money. and aggravation for future purchases.,The property is extremely spacious and clean.  We had a two bedroom with two bath corner condominium. a complete kitchen. and open area living space.  Everything you needed to make a comfortable home away from home!  There is filtered water provided within the refrigerator and washer/dryer unit included.  The Whole Foods grocery store is conveniently located within the Ink Block Complex.  It was very private and conveniently located next to major roads.  The friendly staff was just a phone call away and very helpful!

Some staff are generous to accommodate. Good public transport. close to T station.

Apartments on Harrison Avenue,Duncan,New Zealand,10 Reviews,September 18  2016,10,N/A,It would be helpful in the address description to say that it is "300 Harrison Ave on corner of Herald Ave" Our cab driver did not have GPS and Harrison is a looong street.
Apartments on Harrison Avenue,Daniel,United States of America,16 Reviews,September 12  2016,9.6,We were traveling by car and had quite a few bags and there was only a 15 min parking space two blocks from the building entrance which made it a bit complicated to unload all up.,The facilities are excellent and the apartment was very comfortable and very well furnished.

Apartments on Harrison Avenue,Lorig,United States of America,1 review,July 23  2016,8.8,They needed to put many more details on the ad for these apartments because it is very different than staying in a hotel. I wish I knew the kitchen was completely full with small appliances. pots and pans. dishes and utensils. We needed 2 keys and we could not get another key. It was difficult because a key is necessary to go up in the elevator and we only had one key. so at times the one upstairs had to come down to let the other back up in the elevator. Also. there definitely were not enough bath towels or hand towels or washcloths available for 2 adults and 2 small children for 2 nights. There were only 2 of each type of towel when we were 4 people staying 2 nights.,The apartments were beautiful and modern. The kitchen was a full kitchen with all the amenities and small appliances. The pool was great for the children.

Apartments on Harrison Avenue,Sarah,United Kingdom,1 review,May 30  2016,6.3,Listing was misleading and was falsely advertised about the beds and pool!

Element Boston Seaport by Westin,James,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 12  2017,6.3,The hotel feels very cheaply built.  Despite being open less than a year. there was moderate wear and tear in our room.  The stick-built building offers virtually no sound protection.  We could hear people talking that weren't adjacent to our room or in the hall.   The HVAC system is the loudest I've experienced in any hotel. ever.,Good location near the cruise terminal.

Element Boston Seaport by Westin,John,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 7  2017,8.3,The entry doors were annoying.  They opened out of sync forcing one carrying baggage to enter the first door on the right and then walk kitty corner across the breezeway to enter the second door on the left.  Difficult with large bags.  It would have been helpful to have a concierge or more staff available to check in and answer questions.  It would be helpful to have a list of restaurants nearby and a map to find them.,Breakfast was bountiful and good.  The  rooms were comfortable and the bed was great.  The pull out sofa was a little small to sleep two as advertised.  We had the King Suite and the kitchenette was very nice. The views of the city were wonderful and the location makes it a short Uber ride to find nearly anything.

There is a lovely D lawn nearby the hotel where is very nicely designed for outside activities !A pool is fun for the kids after a day of sightseeing. just that bear in mind quite cold when u first step in.Overall it is a great hotel to stay in during your holiday!
Element Boston Seaport by Westin,Rutger,Netherlands,3 Reviews,August 28  2016,7.9,Hotel is actually fitted for conference center. Far from downtown. Very expensive parking facilities. Ps: we did find out you can park for free 2 blocks away from the hotel,Very modern. clean. well organized
Element Boston Seaport by Westin,Joe,Canada,1 review,August 26  2016,9.6,Remove the meeting table near patio entrance. During breakfast. groups would hog the table and chat and look at maps while other had to stand and eat. They need to book a meeting room.Add umbrellas  on patio or a canopy cover. people can eat outside if some shade to enjoy a drink or meal.Change room/shower room near lobby for pool area.,Staff. Clean hotel. great breakfast for what you pay. rooms were great. 10 min walk to the water. 20 min walk to downtown. Taxi's in courtyard. Parking location was excellent and affordable.  Loved the kitchenette.
Element Boston Seaport by Westin,Renee,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 5  2016,8.3,It was a 10 walk to subway every day that being said it is a good line.,Brand new hotel. Big rooms with queen beds. Coffee machine in lobby. Full breakfast. Excellent value
Element Boston Seaport by Westin,Paul,Canada,1 review,July 24  2016,7.1,Hot breakfast was cold. Coffee was not drinkable. Air conditioner was so loud - sounded like a jet engine was in our room. not kidding. We had to turn it off. And check in was not good. We waited to be served for 15-20mins. Two people at check in. One was with another guest trying to figure out room options. the other on the phone. A third person was in and around the desk but did not help out. Room was small. pull out was not usable. it went right up against the bed when it was pulled out leaving no room to walk through.,Rooms were very clean and nicely appointed. King studio was small. Pull put barely fit. Could not walk between pull out couch and bed so our kids had to sleep on the sofa vs the pull out.
Element Boston Seaport by Westin,Adel,France,23 Reviews,July 18  2016,9.2,Tell the customer to go to the parking but you can park in the street and pay a lot cheaper ;-) Otherwise i highly recommandBreakfast not so great...,LocationGreat facilities (gym and pool)Room really nice
Element Boston Seaport by Westin,Casey,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 7  2016,9.6,Parking is not free. There is a lot. but it costs $15/day and $25/day on weekends. You have the option to park on the street. but it was metered.That's my only complaint.,The room was very clean.Bed was extremely comfortable.Staff was very accomodating. Brand new hotel. Love that it is LEED certified / Sustainable.Room was very quiet. The airport is close by and we barely noticed the noise (we were on the 5th floor). Wide variety for breakfast/complimentary tooOverall the hotel was beautiful and away from the busy downtown area. Everything was still within 10 minutes; we were able to walk to many locations and didn't have any problems.
Element Boston Seaport by Westin,Pam,United States of America,1 review,May 31  2016,9.6,I liked everything about this hotel..,The amenities was awesome. it would be great for long term stay. an L couch for lounging around. Full size fridge and full kitchenette was awesome.  Depends on what you're there for. it is centrally located.  We needed to attend an event at the Seaport. it is a good 10mins walk.  Otherwise it is across from the convention center and within walking distance to tons of restaurants with a bit of walk. Next to public parking which is a plus. Free wi-fi for guests.
Element Boston Seaport by Westin,Alejandra,United States of America,1 review,May 31  2016,10,N/A,We really enjoyed the location. very quiet and still close to a lot of restaurants. The breakfast was really good too. they have a variety of everything (bread. pastries. sandwiches. coffee. cereal).
Element Boston Seaport by Westin,Elise,United States of America,1 review,May 24  2016,9.2,N/A,The room had a full kitchen I wasn't aware of that when I booked the room it was a great surprise! The bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. the bathroom and shower were beautiful. We couldn't find the ice machine and the front desk delivered ice to both of our rooms
Element Boston Seaport by Westin,Chris,United States of America,1 review,May 1  2016,9.2,Well not much can be done with this but the hotel is in the flight path of Logan on some days. Also directly across D street is a city maintenance depot; trucks started rolling around 3:30 AM. It is a decent hike to the  Seaport World Trade Center where my conference was located. It would be much better for a conference at the convention center.,Nice room. great breakfast and happy hour. Recommend the Element in particular for young people as there was a crowd each evening for the free drinks(Harpoon brewery!) and food. Nice touch. The staff was friendly and accommodating.
Element Boston Seaport by Westin,Kathleen,United States of America,1 review,March 16  2016,9.6,Would have liked to have a convenience store inside with daily newspaper. magazines and toiletries available.,We enjoyed the morning breakfast buffet.

Two-Bedroom on Arch Street Apt 5C,Claire,Ireland,5 Reviews,October 22  2017,10,A little bit noisy at night however it is to be expected in a city centre.,Excellent property located in great central location. the property management property were excellent and very prompt in dealing with any queries we had.

Two-Bedroom on Arch Street Apt 5C,Paul,Australia,4 Reviews,August 18  2017,9.5,Once in the front door the access to the apartment was down through the basement. then to a lift that went to the right floor - alternative were a stack of stairs. Was a bit strange,Location was great. rooms clean and comfortable. kitchen was fully appointed
Two-Bedroom on Arch Street Apt 5C,Sally,Australia,12 Reviews,August 14  2017,6.7,Access poor very steep wooden stairs. Apartment 5 th floor very difficult with cases.  Couch 3 seater for 4 people. Not enough towels or pillows. No linen for extra pillows,Location fabulous. Close to everything
Two-Bedroom on Arch Street Apt 5C,Vincenzo,Italy,13 Reviews,May 17  2017,8.8,The only small disadvantage was that we must climb a flight of stairs to reach the elevator. Your cannot alway use 101 entrance where you can easy reach the elevator,The location in downtown is the best you can desire. This can justify the cost per day that is not a cheap one. However you must consider that Boston is an expensive city.You can visit Boston without taking a bus. metro or taxi. just walking.
Two-Bedroom on Arch Street Apt 5C,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 6  2017,8.8,Only one couch that sent three people in the living roomLots of stairs,Good location  about the same price as a hotel

The Ledder House,Valérie,France,4 Reviews,October 30  2017,8.8,We were a group of 10 people and the apartment was a bit crowded with two bathrooms and not much place to sit in the kitchen. However. it is perfect for 6 people.,Our hosts were really nice and helpful. They provided us with some eggs. bread. butter. etc. for breakfast because we arrived quite late in the evening. The apartment is very clean and nicely decorated. there is a bus stop right in front of the house and the underground station (red line) is quite near too ( about 10 minutes by foot) so that you can get downtown in about 20 minutes.

12 Mt. Vernon Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,James,United Kingdom,12 Reviews,October 17  2017,7.5,Small bathroom. Property a little far outside the main Boston area but only a $15 dollar taxi ride which is nothing between four people. A little tip. there are two Mt Vernon Streets in Boston. this one is in Charlestown. the other is more central Boston. We had done our homework based on the central property and missed being close to areas like Charles Street with it's shops and bars. However having sought out the other address we were happy with the property we stayed in.,Very good apartments with lots of facilities. Easy walking to shops and a small selection of bars/restaurants. Very quiet location convenient for start of freedom trail.Try the Warren Tavern for good ales and food.
12 Mt. Vernon Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 1  2017,9.6,The pillows were uncomfortable. The towels were very small.,We loved having a key pad to access the apartment. It was meet all of our needs as a historical home. We didnt know we had others staying in the top apartment. which means it had great privacy and no noise to deal with. The location was excellent.
12 Mt. Vernon Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Michael,United Kingdom,12 Reviews,August 18  2017,8.8,Rooftop access involved steep ladder and trapdoor which was difficult to raise.  Air conditioning a bit patchy.,Pleasant location in a lovely residential area with bus stop nearby and nice views from the rooftop.
12 Mt. Vernon Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Amy,United States of America,6 Reviews,June 29  2017,8.3,It is pretty far from downtown Boston. Extremely narrow streets in Charlestown where it is located. Parking. trolls. bus. subway cost extra so we walked everywhere. Grocery is quite a hike and wanted to save some money by cooking in the apartment.,Very safe. quite neighborhood! About a block from Beacon Hill at the start of the freedom trail. Amazing rooftop deck view! Very comfortable beds! The washer and dryer did a nice job. You can only stay in a historic building like this in Boston! It was well worth it for my family of 5!
12 Mt. Vernon Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Michael,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,May 2  2017,8.3,Check out time of 11:00 was a bit early.,This was a fantastic location in a lovely area of the city. not too far from the city centre.

When I returned to Boston I will look to stay here again.

Apartment in the Heart of Boston,Anonymous,Ireland,2 Reviews,October 31  2017,7.1,3 of us were staying however only towels and pillows provided for two people. I had to ring the landlord and get her to drop more over. The entrance is not very welcoming. could do with a tidy up,Spacious property. equipped kitchen
Apartment in the Heart of Boston,MLC77,Canada,31 Reviews,October 28  2017,7.1,Landlady was to supply a second key. This did not happen. There is no dining table. just a coffee table which was difficult to use when eating. The layout has many one/two step levels. due to the age of the building. When we arrived we did not realized the entrance was off the back alley and  we had to pull our suitcases through the gravel.,The location was excellent. Seven minutes walk to Copley Square. Having a driver to take us to the airport and handle our luggage was a plus. The suite is large. Owners are nice.
Apartment in the Heart of Boston,Carla,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 19  2017,10,Parking was kind of a hassle.  Although. we found a parking garage about ten walking mins. way.

Apartments on Newbury Street,Former,United States of America,1 review,October 5  2017,8.3,There were small hairs in the bathroom and hair in the main living spaces which was a little gross. The bathroom is outdated. but to me. it added to the charm. The rug in the main living space was also stained from wear and tear. which made it appear dirty.,I loved how quaint and charming the apartment was at the heart of Back Bay. The location was perfect for walking to the convention center. restaurants. and different T stops. I would stay here again.
Apartments on Newbury Street,Ingo,Germany,1 review,November 16  2016,6.7,Very high price for a studio apartment that is comfortable. but has some flaws. I booked at a busy time while a large congress was going on. and the daily rate was about as high as a 3 or even 4 star hotel in the city (c $400 a day).Problems and suggestions for improvement:The Keys are provided inside lockboxes. which you find next to the doors. when you book they send you a code how to open them. Identifying the right lockbox and getting it to open took a while of trial and error. also because the lockbox models were different. This can considerably raise your stress level if you arrive late at night. are stuck outside and there is no one around to ask. Another visitor arrived at the same time and we both struggled with the lockboxes for a few minutes. My lockbox was fairly easy to open once I had found it. hers was a different model and wouldn't open at first. When it finally did. neither of us could explain how it did.Suggestions to the owners to easily solve this: Please get new lockboxes. all with the same model. Mark them differently (letters ABC. or shapes such as circles. squares etc). The way the lockboxes are marked now. well... for safety reasons. I will not write details here but let me say the markings should not give so much information away to strangers.It would then be good if the welcoming email gave people more guidance how to find the right box and open it. maybe with two or three small pictures.As I first entered my room. I flipped the light switch next to the door and nothing happened. I found a different lamp next to the door. which worked. Then I noticed the central light had been removed from the ceiling.  There were brown traces on the ceiling that looked like water damage. Maybe that is why they removed the electricity there. No drama but I would expect more from an apartment at this high daily rate. This should be repaired and the ceiling should be painted to cover the brown stains.,The location is optimal. in the middle of Newbury street and just around the corner from Hynes convention center. The apartment itself is clean. and very comfortable with a combined living room/bedroom. a great-looking modern kitchen. including an oven. fridge and freezer. a large microwave and a washing machine (I did not use the latter). As this is a house with apartments. there is no staff around you could ask for direct help but they respond very quickly to emails.

Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Wendy,United States of America,1 review,November 1  2017,5.8,The price of the hotel was too high.

Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Iain,United Kingdom,11 Reviews,October 23  2017,8.3,You have to join HHonors to get free Wi-fi! That’s a scam and should be beneath a chain of this standard. We have spent 3 weeks in New England and a weekend in a class hotel in Montreal and the Wi-fi was free everywhere - no strings.,As you would expect from the brand. a well-appointed room with every amenity. The location is excellent - a short walk to everywhere in downtown Boston.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 20  2017,10,I missed having a nice spacious lobby to hang out in.

Bed was very comfortable.  Wheelhouse Restaurant=great coffee/breakfast items.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Karen,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 20  2017,10,The bathroom had a bath/shower and toilet. and then an outer area with single sink and mirror and towels.  There wasn't a lot of room to store two people's toiletries by the sink so I used the windowsill in the shower room.  No mirror in the shower room - that would have been really handy.     Breakfast not included in our room rate.,Beds were very comfortable. and room was clean. Coffee making facility in room. and bottled water each day.    We had a room with two double beds on 15th floor. was very quiet and had good views of the city.  Convenient location.

Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Theresa,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 16  2017,6.3,We checked in about 1pm. When we arrived at our room there were dirty dishes from room service directly outside our door. We did see the cleaning service personal &amp; assumed they were taking care of our floor. We left the room about 45minutes later &amp; the dishes were still there. We came back about 7:30pm &amp; the dishes were still there. We left the room at 8:30 am the next morning to go for a walk &amp; the dishes were still there. We checked out at 11:30am &amp; the dishes were still there.

Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Amanda,United States of America,6 Reviews,October 4  2017,8.8,No real view. Bathroom door lock appeared broken. Very expensive. even more so due to conventions.,Location was excellent. quick walk to subway and to places. such as Quincy Market and Faneuil Hall and even North End. Surrounded by restaurants. Staff was efficient and stored our luggage after we checked out. so that we could still explore the city. Room was clean. Feels safer because you need room key to access room floors.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Christine,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 4  2017,10,Nothing. except staying a few more days!!,Bed and pillows were like sleeping on a cloud!  Bathroom was huge and loved the window ledge to set out toiletries on while getting ready!

Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Anonymous,United States of America,4 Reviews,September 25  2017,6.7,I did not like that the parking was Valet and was an extra 51 dollars a night and no one advised us on parking down the street for 9 dollars a night.  We were not able to check in early and was not emailed back from the Hilton.,Everything was in walking distance.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Amber,United States of America,1 review,September 20  2017,10,N/A,You are right downtown next to everything. There were some great restaurants - local flare and hip new style (the Bostonia) and great coffee shops (Dunkin Donuts. Starbucks. the black cofffee? austrian style coffee so good!) you're basically 2 blocks from the water and the freedom trail.  Its a historical feeling hotel that feels well kept.  We had a great room 1136.  Large size. great windows. comfy bed.  The hotel restaurant was totally awesome.  Decor was great. stylish. great drinks/wine options.  Staff friendly as well.  The valet cost is high!  But the cost the room was the least out of comparable hotels.  Would very much recommend this hotel.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Anonymous,Australia,1 review,September 20  2017,10,The service for breakfast was a bit leisurely and people ordering off the regular menu seemed to be served more quickly. The boiled eggs for the Continental breakfast were cold even though they were an additional cost. I had to ask when some items would be coming and gave up on the requested hot water for my 2nd cup of peppermint tea as no-one seemed to be coming.,The staff were very helpful when they knew I had mobility issues.. The bed and room were very comfy. The service staff were very efficient and nice. The location of the hotel was excellent. I was able to access the room fairly quickly post arrival.

They all of a sudden started. Bathing me with no warning an extra 30 bucks for a rollaway bed we added to the room. I never ever paid extra. They specifically blamed it on booking.com and the fact that the toll seats are in high demand this weekend therefore they had to charge r tea. That's illegal.. I told them I've been a great customer for 20 years they didn't care.. I told them I never paid extra for a rollaway bed.. they said they didn't care.. I was shocked. Not sure what happened. The staff that is always there is the best ever. We have gotten friendly with all of them! They make that hotel  what  it is.. they were even shocked... long story is the front desk people and manager treated us like dirt and wanted to charged us r tea for no resin other then they could screw us after we settled in.,Horrible experience.

Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Stacy,United States of America,1 review,September 14  2017,9.6,Tub would not drain and we called down and we were told someone was going to fix it. However. nobody ever came and I showered in 6 inches of water.,Bed was comfortable and lots of space for a room in Boston.  I asked for a room away from elevators and was very happy with the room I was given.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Cathy,United States of America,1 review,September 1  2017,9.2,Price was high but in line with the high cost of hotels in downtown Boston; getting car (valet parking) took 20 - 30 minutes but they told you that upfront.,Great staff. made us feel welcome.  Close to many attractions. Uber rides readily availabe and highly recommended instead of driving and parking downtown.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 22  2017,8.8,Lots of hair found in tub and sink. Yuck!Lights were difficult to control in room. Not cool enough.,Location perfect and close to many site seeing spots.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,David,Ireland,8 Reviews,August 3  2017,9.2,Prices for food &amp; drink. although probably in keeping with other similar local establishments of the same standard were a bit shocking to us - 16 dollars for a small glass of house white wine!,Great Location. Nice area. quiet and but near to some great attractions
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Diane,Sweden,4 Reviews,July 28  2017,5.8,There was no free wifi in the rooms.  That is almost unheard of this day and age.  If I had known that. I would NEVER have booked at the exhorbitant price of this hotel.  Also. the maid never came to make the bed or clean the bathroom the first night we stayed. We were only staying two nights so this makes it even more important.  Very sloppy on housekeeping's part.,The rooms were well appointed.  the bed comfortable. the bathroom spacious and clean upon arrival.

Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Noreen,United States of America,5 Reviews,July 21  2017,6.3,Two rooms booked. First room dated and needed to be updated and second room had no shower ability as knob for shower broke off and you could not use after running for an hour. This is the first Hilton that I have stayed at that everything was not stellar. Told reception desk about no shower ability and she could have cared less.,Location. staff were friendly.bed was comfortable
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Donald,United States of America,1 review,July 20  2017,7.9,N/A,Our wifi didn't work very well and we never did get it fixed. although the staff was very helpful.  The price of the room was extremely high. but the other place we stayed on our initial arrival in Boston was in a food desert so I guess it was worth the price.  You might indicate on your ratings the proximity of eating establishments. as that can be a factor if you get on an evening flight and wold like a nice meal.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Betty,United States of America,1 review,July 15  2017,7.0,When we came back to our room at 5 pm the room was a mess. The bed was tore apart. the vacumn was in the room and nothing cleaned. we had to leave for half hr so someone could fiiosh the job.,location
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Davide,Switzerland,1 review,July 12  2017,5.0,Crazingly expensive. I was also charged an additional 800 dollars that luckily were reimbursed after some days. Noisy. Tv with restricted choixe of channels. Staff at the hall was not friendly at all when I had a problem with my card for the initial payment. Lights poor in the room. Sink in the bathroom was not getting rid of water well. Restaurant makes poor portions: I took ravioli. I got 4 raviolis for 24 dollars: I let you do the Maths.,Water bottles available in the room. Cleaning staff works well and has goid manners.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Steve,Canada,9 Reviews,June 21  2017,7.5,No view. Room facilities would do a little bit more like providing hair shampoo and sleeper. Air conditioning and heat controlled seems did not work. Maybe it's central controlled.,Room tidy and clean. Layout was good.  Not far from transport and grocery shops.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Kerry,United States of America,1 review,June 19  2017,9.2,I was looking to move rooms and was told that would be possible. Only to find out the day I needed to move (my family joined me). that there were not suites available. Property didn't have umbrellas to lend out for the heavy rain.,Late check out!Nice security feature in elevators. must flash key to access floors.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Emily,United States of America,1 review,June 14  2017,7.1,While the room was nice there were many little things that took away from it being a great experience. There were chips in the furniture. poor repairs done on the bathroom ceiling that looked terrible. and poor quality towels.,The location was excellent. Near waterfront and area activities. The staff were friendly and helpful.  The rooms were very clean and the hotel seemed very safe.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Agata,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,June 12  2017,7.1,The facilities weren't great - I would have expected better from Hilton. There wasn't even a sauna or a steamroom. let alone an indoor pool. I also never received a reply from the hotel when I asked for travel advice ahead of our stay (and I emailed twice).,The room was very comfortable and cleanliness was perfect. The location was fantastic. with just a few steps to the beautiful harbour and Faneuil Hall.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Ruth,United States of America,1 review,June 3  2017,9.6,Nothing!!,The staff was extremely helpful.  We arrived at 11 AM. way ahead of the 3 PM check-in time. and asked if we could leave our bags while we toured the city.  The front desk staff were so very nice. and were able to check us into our room at that time.  I was extremely impressed with everything about this hotel!!!
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Elvia,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 31  2017,4.6,Huge disappoint for me were that the outlets in not one. but two of the lamps in the beautiful suite did not work.  Unfortunately I did not realize this until I awakened late (no alarm) that morning to  lifeless batteries in both my cell phone and laptop computer.  Very disappointing for a one-night stay that cost over $400.,Location. Location. Location! The adjacent bar and dual entry ways were all very nice.  The room was beautiful.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Visitingboston,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 31  2017,6.3,none of the provided outlets worked so I had to unplug the lamps in the room to be able to plug in my laptop. cell phone charger. etc. I plugged in the lamps before I left though. Kinda crappy for a hotel that I spent 2400 bucks to stay in for 4 days. To be honest. the room was small for that kind of money too. but since it was just me and I was at a conference. I didn't mind too much.,I loved the location. right in downtown Boston made it easy to get everywhere I wanted to go.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Pilar,Spain,9 Reviews,May 30  2017,8.8,I would have liked to have a good room from the start.,When I arrived I got a terrible room. very old and with the air conditioning machines right under my window. After talking to the front desk manager I got a better room. completely refurbished and less noisy.I also have to say that the doormen were really helpful and nice. the best I have ever met.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Karen,United States of America,1 review,May 9  2017,8.3,Bed was not supportive enough- awoke with back ache each day. Luckily the fitness center had good items to help get the kinks out. No NESN on tv- couldn't watch the sox. We parked 1 block away at the post office lot- $61 for the whole weekend instead of $51 per night the hotel charges- worth the 4 Min walk,Loved the decor. the history  and location. It was pretty quiet too
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,AlphaBah,Sierra Leone,15 Reviews,May 6  2017,9.6,N/A,Nice and clean room. The room is spacious and has all the basic things that one will need.Friendly and very responsive staff. I got a text message immediately after my arrival. welcoming me and asking me if there's anything I will need. Upon checkout. the staff were very helpful with the luggage storage and delivery.That's great service.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Brian,Belgium,14 Reviews,May 2  2017,6.3,You had to sign in to the wifi every other time that you would connect which meant you needed to find your hilton honers number and go through the process. Quite annoying.,The staff always had a smile on their faces.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Bridget,United States of America,1 review,May 2  2017,7.5,The two double beds were truly double beds. As in glorified twin beds. The beds were not at all large enough for two people to sleep in together. as it was my 10 year old slept with my husband and neither had enough room. Two queens would be perfect. and there would be plenty of room for those in the room. The beds were very comfortable. just not big enough at all. If they aren't going to change to queen beds. I highly recommend they get rid of the two club chairs and put a pull out sofa in each room.,The staff. especially the concierge and the doormen. were fabulous. Very personable. great sense of humor. and of course helpful. Our waiter at breakfast Sunday morning was also awesome. and was very good to our 10 year old son and joked with him.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Kathleen,United States of America,1 review,April 10  2017,4.6,The room was very hot.  The coffee was awful.  The money that we paid on the room was not up to pare.  We paid a lot for the room and it was not what we expected at all.   The room was clean but not as nice as we had expected.,The bed was comfy.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Abbey,United States of America,6 Reviews,March 29  2017,8.8,The first room we were in was an adjoining room and the people next door were very loud and obnoxious.  The front desk staff kindly moved our room and it was an upgrade.  I would request a room that is not adjoining as the walls were thin.,The location is perfect as it is a short walk to Quincy Market but on a pretty quiet street.  The gym was well equipped.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,March 28  2017,7.5,Charged more than promised on booking.com price.  In the process of getting it fixed. but staff is not too helpful.  Rooms were not quiet; people next door were yelling early in the morning and woke us up.  We could hear them loud and clear.,Good location. rooms were clean and nice.

Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Rolando,Puerto Rico,1 review,March 20  2017,9.2,It was pricey.  A little over what one should pay for that type of facility. I think I paid a premium  because it was St. Patrick's weekend which was totally incidental to the purpose of my trip.,Everything
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Kristin,United States of America,2 Reviews,March 1  2017,10,Only wish we had a better view of the city.,I liked that the staff was super friendly. They helped us find the closest and best priced parking garage.I also dropped my credit card in front of the elevator on our floor and they helped me find it very quickly. I wish I got names so I could praise them again personally. they also let us borrow an umbrella because we forgot ours.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Jennifer,United States of America,1 review,February 21  2017,8.8,Pillows were flat - my husband and I both had stiff necks even though we piled up multiple pillows.Breakfast was good but pricey.,The whole family had a good time. The staff were extremely polite and helpful. The room was plenty big &amp; clean. Thermostats were easy to find. and easy to adjust. Plenty of plugs for electronics. Mini fridge is always nice to have.The hotel was very quiet as a whole - no issues sleeping. We had a beautiful view outside of our window. Location was great - we were able to walk or take the trolley anywhere we wanted to go. Plenty of restaurants in the area.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,David,United States of America,1 review,February 13  2017,8.8,A hotel of this caliber and price should have free guest Wi-Fi.  Instead. they make you pay unless you're some AT&amp;T member or something.A small microwave would be good too.,N/A
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Janis,United States of America,1 review,January 31  2017,10,N/A,Breakfast was served in the very nice adjoining restaurant Fin Point / 89 Broad Street. The vouchers were very generous and was a pleasant change from the normal breakfast bars at most hotels.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Alison,United States of America,4 Reviews,January 25  2017,8.8,We ate at the hotel's restaurant for dinner and were disappointed.

Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,January 7  2017,7.9,Breakfast food and service was laughable.  Dunkin Donuts provided a more tasty breakfast.  And I sat at the bar so why the service was so bad is odd.  Food was tasteless and luke warm (eggs. pots and bacon).  The English muffin wasn't even a real English muffin.  Daytime desk help and conscierge were very so so.,Great location to the waterfront area in Boston.  Everything is in walking distance.  Room was very spacious. comfy and quiet
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Paula,United Kingdom,12 Reviews,January 6  2017,9.2,Lack of communication,I was a little dubious about this hotel as I'd emailed them twice to confirm my booking and didn't receive a reply. however I was pleasantly surprised.

Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Carol,United States of America,1 review,January 2  2017,7.5,Poor water pressure in our faucet. and a condom wrapper under our bed.

Clean aside from the wrapper.
Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,January 1  2017,2.5,I don't know it is Booking.com's fault or the hotel's fault. but I was charged with wrong total. Booking.com said the total is 569 dollars and it turned out that I needed to pay 636 dollars for my stay. I sent emails to Booking.com to ask them to fix this problem but didn't get any responses yet.,My stay in Hilton was fantastic. This review has such low score is just because I was charged with around 70 dollars more.

Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall,Emilia,United Kingdom,1 review,October 19  2016,9.6,The first room we were offered we turned down without even seeing because it was internal. which are usually claustrophobic. but we were then offered an external room without a fuss. The shower in our bathroom (restroom) was not up to European standards - but l'm nit-picking.,We didn't use any of the hotel facilities but our room was top rate.

Gorgeous 2 Bedroom Apartment by Boston University and Private Parking,Jonathan,Sweden,5 Reviews,July 23  2017,8.8,Long ride to get there. Felt like it took forever because the tram went really slow (in reality 30-40 min to downtown).The bulding in which the appartment is located is in need of a lot of fixing up. Trash in the hallways. weird smell etc (although the appartment was nice! see above). At first it seemed like it was a bad neighbourhood. However turns out it's a really nice part of Boston/Brookline with good cafés. restaurants just a 15 min walk away.,Great appartment! Felt like we where the first guests to stay in it. Everything was very fresh and new. Good beds. AC and bathroom. Plenty of space and a kitchen that had everything you could need. The hosts Jesus &amp; Otto were very helpful. checked several times to see if we needed anything and if everything was alright.

Hostel had simple. but good breakfast. rooms were cleaned everyday. as were bathrooms. Single bathrooms/showers were great for privacy. Staff in the hostel were very helpful with advice on what to do and where to go. Rooms were quiet. no disturbances.
HI - Boston Hostel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 23  2017,10,Had a good time.,The private bathrooms. the way the beds were arranged in the floor the eating facility with the windows and the arrangement that the food is good and a variety
HI - Boston Hostel,Sam,United States of America,1 review,October 20  2017,9.2,The showers were gross. I understand it was shared bathrooms but it looks like itâ€™s has not been cleaned and scrubbed in awhile. The walls were yellow and green and the lining was nasty. I found a booger on the lining maps... I did shower cause I was traveling back to the US from overseas so I wanted to feel relax. I showered with my flip flops on and I was disappointed that showers werenâ€™t as hot as I wanted them to be; I showered in the middle of the day after I arrived.,It was affordable especially if you only needed a place to sleep. The area was an easy access to local bars and food. The staff was super nice and accommodate to anything that you needed. They provided complimentary breakfast that helped me kicked off my day while traveling for hours. The 2nd floor was spacious and comfy which provided students a studying area. kitchen with all amenities including dishes and pots. a single tv and a library with donated books. all with a beautiful view of Boston. I took an all female room which is kind of like a dorm with bunk beds. They had personal lockers inside the bedroom but make sure you have your own locks! The ladies I shared the room with us respectful when others were sleeping and during quiet hours. I was most pleased with my sleep since I didnâ€™t get any well rest during my flights.
HI - Boston Hostel,Jane,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,October 20  2017,8.8,For the type of place it is (youth hostel) can't think of any improvements!,The 'vibe' was good and there was a real mix in ages of those staying. The shower room had enough space. I stayed in a room of four which was well designed. The breakfast was simple but filling and tasty.
HI - Boston Hostel,Anonymous,Romania,12 Reviews,October 19  2017,9.6,everything was ok. nothing to complain,I had a very pleasant stay at HI Boston. everything was very clean. location close to center and Freedom Trai. The South Station is at 20 minutes walking distance. Breakfast was frugal but nothing to complain about it. everything was great!
HI - Boston Hostel,Marta,Portugal,25 Reviews,October 19  2017,8.8,As my bed was located near the door all the banging doors from other rooms and restrooms were a little bit audible. It would be nice if the bunk beds had a small shelve where you could place some of your bellongins (cellphone. wallet. etc..),The staff is nice. The location is really good. the subway is nearby or just 15 minutes walking from the south station (where you have the silver line to the airport).
HI - Boston Hostel,Natalia,Poland,8 Reviews,October 18  2017,9.6,N/A,It was one of the best hostels I've ever been to! Great location. pretty newly renowated building. all clean. with nice common areas and nice rooms with such comfortable bed that I almost overslept for my walking tour. ;) Breakfast was included. Cool shower curtains. :) Thank you for a great stay. hope to be back to HI Boston Hostel one day!
HI - Boston Hostel,Charlotte,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,October 18  2017,8.3,The check in was a bit unorganised. You have to write your name down and hen sit and wait to be called because it's a big hostel and gets quite busy. The staff are not as friendly as they could be but that might just be because it's busy and they have a lot to get through.,By far the best hostel I've stayed in in the two months I've been travelling Canada and the US. The free breakfast was really good and a great selection. I was in a 6 bed mixed dorm and the layout meant each bed was quite private with the lockers blocking the other bunks which is nice. Massive slices of pizza next door for $3 too and they're amazing!
HI - Boston Hostel,Lonni,United States of America,1 review,October 18  2017,10,I was told that I would be sharing a room with 4 beds but was put in a room with six beds yet it was still quiet even sharing with that many people. It was just that I don't like being told one thing then getting something else otherwise I enjoyed the stay very much &amp; appreciated the considerate staff &amp; amenities.,I was impressed with the whole set up; it provided all of the comforts of home. I was impressed that it could serve so many people yet there were many places to sit &amp; have quiet time. The place &amp; the staff were very helpful with everything that I wanted or needed. I really enjoyed my stay there &amp; would do it again. Thank you. Lonni Munson
HI - Boston Hostel,Michael,Australia,3 Reviews,October 18  2017,8.8,The room had polished concrete floors. giving the dorm a rather cold atmosphere. The air conditioning unit in our dorm room kept leaking. which made the room smell musty with stagnant air con water. The maintenance staff would come and fix it but the next day it would be leaking again.,The hostel was centrally located. close to Boston Commons. with heaps of great places to eat within walking distance. The common areas were really comfortable and well-maintained. The bathrooms were consistently clean and the shower curtains had a very satisfying Boston subway map design.
HI - Boston Hostel,Andrew Jongsun Kim,Canada,5 Reviews,October 18  2017,8.8,Actually it's not their fault though....this price is quite expensive for hostel. I mean. especially Hi-Boston is. I know Lodging in Boston is even more expensive than New York. but I think so many people don't know this fact.  And restaurants are expensive for their offer and service.,If you guys wanna stay in hostel. HI hostels are best choice. It can be a bit more expensive than others but it worth. Everything was perfect; check-in/out service. kitchen. lobby. room. washroom etc. washroom and shower room is united in one space so you can do any of your body business at once. 7 rooms of shower &amp; toilet are in same floor(I saw 7 but may be more) so you don't have t worry about stocking in your room to wait for it. every floor has huge sofa and wall clock which is really awesome design. Oh. staffs are having exceptional kindness.
HI - Boston Hostel,Roxane,Belgium,29 Reviews,October 17  2017,2.9,All: super expensive. price adverted on booking has to be top up by many taxes (more than the usual taxe in force in the US) + the memberfee.  When you arrive (round 19.00) you have more than 30 minutes waiting to do the check-ing.  Food sold is overpriced. the arrea is full of beggars. zero support to find a parking apart telling you to google to find a parking. but they don't provide you access to PC since you are not registered yet.  This is a factory (usine) and definitively not a Hostel.  After 30 minutes waiting I just decieded to leave the service was too poor for a supid price of 79 US for a bed in a dorm !  there is a far better and cheaper hostel in Boston (not on booking) the Boston padpacker and pub.  Real great. full of services. parking. free breakfast. free shuttel every 30 minutes and that's for 58 S all in.  No doubt. avoid HI and go to Boston padpacker if you are looking for a real hostel,N/A
HI - Boston Hostel,Ming,United States of America,1 review,October 16  2017,6.3,I dislike check in of others into the room in the midnight which affect my sleep. Plus keeping the baggage after check out requires extra charge which is not applied in other places.,I like their facilities. food and bed. I was told there is a gym too but I didn't know until I leave
HI - Boston Hostel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,October 16  2017,4.2,The check in take forever. stuff very slow and unfriendly.Room in the average. in my case light didnâ€™t work and when I reported they did not seem to care at all.Bed they are not comfortable but the problem itâ€™s the air-condition in the room itâ€™s always on in the room at very low temperature that you just freezing all night.And if you survive to AC you cannot sleep any way for the noiseâ€¦  there is same internal ventilation that make a very loud noise day and night but so itâ€™s loud that itâ€™s impossible to sleep and you can hear it throughout the all floor.The worst experience ever!!Do not book this hostel if you are looking for a place to sleep.,nothing
HI - Boston Hostel,Floris,Netherlands,10 Reviews,October 16  2017,7.5,Really cold due to aircon that was full on in the room and could not be turned off...,Had 2 separate bookings. but was able to leave Luggage in between check-out and re-check-in at the hotel for free. Had room at the front of the building and didn't have so much trouble with the hospital being right in front (i.e. ambulances driving past)
HI - Boston Hostel,Floris,Netherlands,10 Reviews,October 14  2017,7.1,Basic breakfast. No non-dairy products available.,Moneys worth. Free wifi. Nice areas to sit and relax or do some work. Easy access to the city. (all in walkings distance). Style of the hotel is nice. metropolitan.
HI - Boston Hostel,Carys,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 14  2017,10,N/A,The most amazing hostel Iâ€™ve ever stayed at! Immaculate bedrooms. bathrooms &amp; the most unbelievably fantastic staff! Loved every second of staying there.
HI - Boston Hostel,Anonymous,Taiwan,1 review,October 13  2017,9.6,N/A,nice bed and clean rest room. Breakfast very simple but good with fresh food. the location is extremely convenient to south station either by bus or walk. I like the space that Hi hostel provided. easy and comfortable.
HI - Boston Hostel,Victoria,United States of America,6 Reviews,October 12  2017,9.6,For a hostel it's a bit on the expensive side. but I suppose it's expensive to have such a state of the art building.  Just one slight negative about the room (six bed female one).  There is a large mirror on the wall. which is convenient. but it also reflects into some of the beds. so that you can see the occupants of the beds from some of the other beds. reflected in the mirror.,This HI hostel is wonderful.  I love staying there.  Its location in Chinatown is great.  Its closeness to the T makes it very easy to get around Boston. and I feel safe at night.  I love buying Chinese pastries in the bakeries nearby.  Also there are many Chinese restaurants around.  The hostel itself is very well designed - all the facilities are great.  It's clean and spacious.  The bed was very comfortable.  Breakfast is very good.  The bathrooms are very nice.  The staff is very friendly.
HI - Boston Hostel,Artem,United States of America,16 Reviews,October 12  2017,8.8,I wish breakfast had slightly more variety; also breakfast facilities were crowded. But these are minor complaints given the price point.,When I was looking for an inexpensive place to stay in Boston which would be centrally located. this was the obvious choice. It turned out to be a reasonably pleasant place as well - everything was clean and in good condition. Great value for money!
HI - Boston Hostel,Jeanette,United States of America,1 review,October 11  2017,8.3,Bathrooms could have been cleaned more often. The doors they have are super heavy and very noisy when they close. You could hear any door close on your floor. sometimes at all hours of the night.,Great facilities. nice kitchen. clean rooms. excellent location.
HI - Boston Hostel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 11  2017,7.1,The showers/toilets were super cramped and could probably do with a few more per floor so avoid waiting long periods of time.The location is a bit seedy at night and a bit of a trek from the T with luggage.,Really liked that the the facility had recently been made over. The lockers for my suitcase was great. although if you're on a top bunk this was be a struggle.
HI - Boston Hostel,Eleanor,Israel,3 Reviews,October 10  2017,3.3,There is a problem.when u order private room and they do not give u detailed information.,Nothing was good there.even compensation that was promised we didnt get after all the wrong things that happen to us .till now im sick with the allergy because it was so dirty
HI - Boston Hostel,Giorgos,Cyprus,210 Reviews,October 9  2017,7.1,I got a single room at a very high price. I don't know if Boston is one of the most expensive destinations in the US but I stayed in better places around the states with much much less,overall a good stay. best of all the location. its clean and comfortable
HI - Boston Hostel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,39 Reviews,October 9  2017,8.3,No complaints,As hostels go. probably the best Iâ€™ve stayed in. No issues with noise in the room. everyone was very courteous. The bed was comfortable. shower facilities very good. right outside the room. Would recommend to anyone travelling to Boston on a budget.
HI - Boston Hostel,Ayush,United States of America,7 Reviews,October 9  2017,8.8,The private room is pretty costly equivalent to a hotel room,location is like 11/10Everything centralThe Boston common is right as you get on street
HI - Boston Hostel,Kitty,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 8  2017,9.6,N/A,I stayed in a private room and the bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was large and very clean. Breakfast was great and the staff were really friendly.
HI - Boston Hostel,Madeleine,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 7  2017,8.3,Bathrooms could have been a cleaner. The check-in process took about an hour of hanging around before I was given my room. which was inconvenient. however I would still stay there again despite the long wait for check-in as the pros definitely outweigh the cons!,Breakfast was great. the cinnamon bagels were delicious. Coffee was tasty too! Location was excellent. It was really useful to have large lockers for suitcase storage after checking out for the rest of the day. All-girl dorm was clean and everything you need for basic accommodation. Free cookies and ear plugs at reception!
HI - Boston Hostel,Robby,Belgium,21 Reviews,October 6  2017,9.6,N/A,Very modern and Good hostel with everything you need. Showers are even in separate bathrooms with sink. shower and toilet. Always clean and bathmats to use.
HI - Boston Hostel,Tk,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 6  2017,7.1,Young staff seemed bored or distracted. Would feel more comfortable with some older staff behind desk. I'm over 50 and felt a little out of place. Whole front desk operation needs to be tightened up and more personable. esp. male staff.,N/A
HI - Boston Hostel,Simon,Switzerland,28 Reviews,October 5  2017,9.2,Until they believed us that the reservation mistake wasn't our fault. one staff treated us a bit bitchy / like we were wrong and just trying to get something we don't deserve. But nevertheless in total it's a highly recommendable hostel and also really cool staff (especially Julia and Tommy)!,Nice breakfast. cookies and coffee for free the whole day long. We got an upgrade when they realized there was a mistake in the reservation process (booking.com sent them wrong information). Friendly staff!
HI - Boston Hostel,Ioannis,Spain,4 Reviews,October 5  2017,8.8,They could for sure work on the soundproof of the rooms and toilettes.,Although it was a hostel and i am not a fan of this kind of places for my holidays. i have to admit this was a great place!! Really clean. private bathrooms and with a great breakfast! Walking distance from pretty much everything and with great personal. Full of activities to minggle with the people. a floor full of stuff to do and with a great organization!
HI - Boston Hostel,Anonymous,Finland,11 Reviews,October 5  2017,6.7,Show was not good - took really long time to get warm water and the amount of water was so weak that made me challenging in washing long hair.,Good location and next to China town - so easy to find nice restaurants. Lots of activities every day - super for people who would like to find company or things to do.
HI - Boston Hostel,Anonymous,United States of America,20 Reviews,October 5  2017,6.7,N/A,Stayed in a 6-bed dormitory style room. The room was a bit small but the decoration was nice and WIFI was good. Everything seemed clean. and staff were efficient.
HI - Boston Hostel,Alyssa,United States of America,1 review,October 4  2017,5.8,The second night (I stayed in another city one night. so there was a gap in my stay; technically I booked two stays. One for Saturday evening. and one for Monday evening) I checked in around 11. and checked out at 5:30 am. but wasn't able to sleep because the room was in the nineties as far as degrees. Also. for one night it was like $80. but I was only there for a few hours (which I know is my own doing) but it still seemed pricey for a six person dorm. for one night.,I liked how clean and modern the rooms were for a hostel. and the breakfast is actually really really good. So that helps with the cost a bit. Bathrooms were also nicer than anticipated.
HI - Boston Hostel,George,United States of America,1 review,October 4  2017,10,N/A,the crew from the front desk manager in the morning to the to the lady whose set up breakfast were friendly. and made me feel more than welcome or a client; the made me feel like a friend. I will definitely be back.
HI - Boston Hostel,Milan,Serbia,2 Reviews,October 3  2017,10,There is no such thing i didnt like :),Absolutley great hostel! I recommend it to everybody :) Has a great rooms. bathrooms are great. everything is clean and breakfast is wonderful too!
HI - Boston Hostel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,October 2  2017,9.2,N/A,One of the best hostels I have been to: spacious. clean. organised. with everything you need. Great location. easy to be found. amazing kitchen with a really nice free breakfast. Totally recommended!
HI - Boston Hostel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 2  2017,10,It was a bit noisy on the street side of the building while trying to fall asleep but due to its location in the theater/nightlife district it's to be expected.,Clean. comfortable and easily accessible. Friendly staff and a chill environment.
HI - Boston Hostel,Stacy,Australia,3 Reviews,October 2  2017,9.2,Heating in the rooms was a little too warm. Made for an uncomfortable night's sleep.,Neat and tidy. great location downtown. Breakfast was basic (toast. cereal. yoghurt) but satisfying.
HI - Boston Hostel,Anton,Russia,7 Reviews,October 1  2017,9.6,A little bit pricey. but hey. this is Boston and I havenâ€™t found a better deal.,This is so far the best hostel Iâ€™ve stayed in. Everything was clean. there was a lot of place. a lot of people. a lot of activities. The location is perfect: it is just 10 minutes from cityâ€™s heart. you can easily reach anything on foot.
HI - Boston Hostel,Maria,Argentina,1 review,October 1  2017,10,Our roommates were inconsiderate and messy  (and a little shabby),Faneuil Hall. Quincy Marketplace. the Pubic Library (beatiful inner square) and Newbury Street.
HI - Boston Hostel,Salomao,Brazil,1 review,October 1  2017,10,N/A,The breakfast time is a great time to meet new people from all around the world. HI Boston staff has some free tourism events separated by day that is a good opportunity to making new friends. Many touristic points is closer just by walking and if not just go to metro in 5 minutes. I really appreciated my time in HI Boston!
HI - Boston Hostel,Mariana,Portugal,17 Reviews,September 30  2017,7.1,The air conditioner was LOUD! And always on! Although it is great that the room has always ventilation (something that lacked on HI NYC). it was a bit too much with this one. Like sleeping below an airplane. I didn't like the bathroom system either. they were few of them on the floors (considering how many rooms there were). and they needed to be cleaned more often. The way the bathrooms are in HI NYC hostel are much better. because you have lots of showers. they're cleaner and you have more space to put your stuff. It's in Chinatown - which can be awesome. because you're a walking distance to the center and other attractions - but I thought it was easier to see homeless people (?) around than other areas in Boston... I also saw one or to persons inside the hostel who seemed to have sneaked in and I felt a bit uncomfortable. It would be better if they had USB at the room for charging of phone.,I liked that the room had enough space for 6 of us. The lockers had good space and I had no security issues. The lady who checked us in was very nice and helpful. Easy lockers's system after check out. and they had a nice gentleman who helped us out with that (although you need CASH!). Great that the reception could help us with change! The breakfast. being self-service. is very varied and you can eat many different things. They also had pancakes on our last day. which was kinda nice (although they were very cold and needed heating).  Good bed and pillows.
HI - Boston Hostel,Nick4768,United Kingdom,17 Reviews,September 29  2017,6.7,No alcohol is allowed in the hostel so there is a real lack of that social element in the evening that you get at other hostels.Someone in my room was snoring so loudly that I couldn't sleep. despite having ear plugs in. Asked to move rooms but couldn't as fully booked.,N/A
HI - Boston Hostel,Ashlee,United States of America,1 review,September 29  2017,9.6,Maybe put a privacy curtain or something to close up your bunk whenever you sleep. It was not a problem at all. but it would have been more convenient.,The location of it was nice. Located just right so I could walk everywhere.The price of it was so much cheaper than anything else. And it was much nicer than I expected.
HI - Boston Hostel,Anonymous,Ireland,11 Reviews,September 29  2017,7.5,You have to read the small prints before you finish your booking. I did not read about the tax (around 3.50USD per day or something like that) because I am not a member.,Good bed. great shower. kitchen clean and tidy.
HI - Boston Hostel,Yerin,South Korea,3 Reviews,September 28  2017,8.3,A private lock is needed to lock the cabinet. But I didn't have one. Someone rooted though my bag when I was out.,It has great facilities like kitchen or lobby or lounge.
HI - Boston Hostel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 28  2017,8.8,I know my room was a "mixed gender" room. but I think I would have stayed somewhere else If I knew that I would be the ONLY female.,Really impressed with the cleanliness of the place. Staff were also pretty helpful and nice. Choices of places to eat in the surrounding area is limitless !
HI - Boston Hostel,Rebecca,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 28  2017,7.9,This was just my personal experience. but my first night I slept above a woman who snored. so 1 could not only hear. but feel the bed vibrating throughout the night. keeping me up... my first night's room was also facing the street so I heard all the buses. honking and sirens as well.,Staff was very accommodating. although they couldn't initially give me a bottom bunk they were able to switch me my second night. If you plan to travel to other big cities sign up for the HI membership. Without it it's an additional 3 dollar fee per day. Location is very central!! Next to the T and in the middle of chinatown. Walking distance from many sites.
HI - Boston Hostel,Fred,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 27  2017,7.9,NOISE!! Not well insulated against traffic and ambulance sirens. which occurred at all hours of the night! No drawers. dresser. so lived out of suitcase for 5 days...,Fabulous location. on safe district near great restaurants. theater and subways.
HI - Boston Hostel,Sopon,Thailand,1 review,September 26  2017,8.3,Noisy. The air condition path s liked the amplifier of the sounds from other room to our room. Since no strictly mention about quiet hours. most of the people there still being noisy after 11pm.,Breakfast and private clean bathroom
HI - Boston Hostel,Peter,Denmark,18 Reviews,September 26  2017,8.8,Would recommend a better lighting system in dormitory. Difficult to find switch in darkness. General light much too sharp. and individual bed lights too difficult to access from outside the bed. Surprised that I could not buy a coffee early in the morning. because the machine was not scheduled to be turned on so early. A bit strange. as this worked well in the evening. The staff was there. friendly enough and doing nothing. but was not allowed to turn on the coffee machine.,For me. it was just a quick cheap sleep-over bestween two flights . As such. it worked well. The dormitory was very quiet. other guests were completely respectful of those wanting to sleep. Public transport between air port and center was efficient and low cost (partly free). The walk to the hostel was some 15 minutes. so OK even with luggage.
HI - Boston Hostel,Amy,United States of America,4 Reviews,September 25  2017,7.1,No standard toiletries in the private room. as in no individual bar soap. no lotion. or shampoo. There were two large soap dispensers. one on the wall of the shower and another by the sink so I guess that was the substitute. Lighting placement was a bit weird. no light switch as you entered the room so you had to walk a couple feet searching for it in the dark. Instead of lamps on the desks. there were spotlights on the wall above the bed that you can turn in different directions. There was one that was really high up and I had to stand on the bed to get to turn on. They were also a little too bright even pointing up and woke me up during the night when my partner went to the bathroom. The breakfast was nothing more than bagels and white bread. Price was a bit steep.,Convenient location. easy check in. Room was minimal and clean. The private queen room had concrete flooring which some people may not like but I did cause that meant no nasty bugs hiding in the carpets. But there were also weird staining prints on the concrete. No bed bugs! Free large bottle of water along with code and tea packets.Nice lounge area in the front of building. I was using this as a standard hotel but it seemed good for a hostel experience and meeting new people since they offered free daily tours around the city.
HI - Boston Hostel,Monika,Poland,3 Reviews,September 25  2017,8.8,It was freezing in the room and the temperature could not be adjusted.,Exceptional interior design! Spacious common rooms. modern facilities. very clean.
HI - Boston Hostel,Xingpin,China,12 Reviews,September 25  2017,9.6,a little bit expensive..,There are so many bathrooms in the hostel. and each bath room is with a toilet which is the best I have ever seen during my travelling in many countries.the bed is super comfortable! the staff are very nice and helpful!the location is also excellent. I can just walk to any spot from the hostel.the breakfast is nice too. several kinds of bread. two kinds of yogurt and apple. coffee. milk.
HI - Boston Hostel,JokerJK,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,September 24  2017,10,The card reader on my room was temperamental and meant i had to get my card restet or rely on someone else being in the room to open my door. Ot became a problem for others when they got back late and everyone was sleeping.,Breakfast is always really great. It is somewhat basic but it's all you really need in the morning to kick start your day - and it beats paying for food elsewhere.The wifi is great. Can do pretty much anything anf you can use it in the lobby even after you checkout.
HI - Boston Hostel,Anonymous,Germany,2 Reviews,September 24  2017,5.8,Hairdryer in some bathrooms completely useless. Not all showerheads working properly. Some beds face directly to entrance so people disturb whilst entering / exiting a dorm. Bit to expensive for a hostel.,Free cookies and earplugs. Decent breakfast. Good location. Airconditioning
HI - Boston Hostel,Tucian,Guernsey,1 review,September 23  2017,6.7,Unfortunately one fellow guest left a mess in 3 restrooms resulting in the staff having to work harder. There weren't enough bath mats in the bathrooms and the main light switch in the room was in the middle of the room making it difficult to see when entering the rooms,N/A
HI - Boston Hostel,Marcus,Germany,35 Reviews,September 22  2017,9.2,breakfast did not have a big variety. most expensive hostel I have seen in a while but I guess that's how it is in Boston ...,comfortable beds in spacious rooms. bathrooms were clean. very close to the center. hostel organizes different activities every day that make it easy to meet other travelers
HI - Boston Hostel,mafe.leite,Brazil,26 Reviews,September 21  2017,7.5,The team was not very kind and did not want to interact. Even having a good space. there were no activities to interact solo travelers and it was not easy meet people.During the time of check in it get too busy and there was no early check in even with space availables.,Comfortable bed. even not having a bathroom in the room it was many ones close and available. Everything was clean and the breakfasts are very nice!They sell some drinks for a good price.
HI - Boston Hostel,Joe,Germany,23 Reviews,September 20  2017,9.6,My only negative is the high price of a dormitory room. but Boston is an expensive city for accommodation. There are no viable budget alternatives,Excellent location. large range of social events organised by the hostel. free breakfast. good common areas and security. friendly staff. Highly recommended for solo travellers!
HI - Boston Hostel,Alex,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,September 19  2017,5.4,Staff generally unfriendly except for Aaron who was very helpful &amp; knowledgable about boston. First room noisy until we requested to move rooms which was much quieter,Good location. clean hostel
2BR With Views of Charles River by STARS of Boston,Sam,United States of America,4 Reviews,September 2  2017,10,Liked everything!,Key pad on door made it very easy to checkin &amp; checkout. wonderful location right next to the Charles River. host was very helpful. apartment was clean. beautiful and great location. Walked few blocks down to main street where we found great restaurants.
2BR With Views of Charles River by STARS of Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,September 1  2017,7.1,A representative whom we spoke to upon arrival about an issue was extremely rude on the phone to us. A customer should never be spoken to that way. However. all other contact with the host was great. Property is a condo at the back of a brownstone and overlooks major road/highway which is noisy. Front door is basically right on a road so you need to be careful with little children when entering and exiting. WiFi did not work at all,Great location. close walking distance to shops and city. Spacious rooms.
2BR With Views of Charles River by STARS of Boston,Elizabeth,United States of America,12 Reviews,August 24  2017,8.8,Parking space is very small. might not be big enough to accommodate a large SUV.  One room air conditioner was not functioning well. When notified management said it would be fixed right away-however we notified them the morning of check out so cannot verify that it was fixed.,Location was awesome. Kitchen was updated. clean. Property managers were easy to reach and responsive ( set up parking the day if arrival without difficulty). Parking is available right outside the unit.
2BR With Views of Charles River by STARS of Boston,Patrick,United Kingdom,16 Reviews,August 23  2017,5.8,Cleaning charge of $125 even tho I only stayed there one night from 10pm to 10am (12 hours!). This was not made very clear on the Booking.com website. I challenged the host on this but they wouldn't budge. Fee is unreasonable in my view.   The apartment is actually a separate building which opens onto an uneven back road that is not pleasant. Would not use again. Host said she would email me with wifi password and TV instructions. Never did.,Large two bedroom facility.
2BR With Views of Charles River by STARS of Boston,Sarah,United States of America,1 review,August 21  2017,5.0,We were to check in for 3pm. We arrived about 20 minutes early. but I had contacted the property in advance and they were aware of this. The place was filthy when we arrived. The garbage was overflowing and covered in flies. All the beds were slept in and dirty sheets and comforters. Bathroom was piled up with dirty towels. dirty toilet.sink and shower were full of hair. Kitchen was a disaster. there was old food in the fridge. Trying to contact the management company took awhile to get any response. We had to wait around for maids until after 3:45 and they still barely cleaned the place once they arrived. One of the bedrooms was 90 degrees because the air conditioning unit wasn't working. Entire apartment was extremely hot as well. standing AC units barely worked and there are no windows to open up. Not quite what we had anticipated having spent over $400 for a one night stay. Would not recommend. Very disappointed.,The central location.
2BR With Views of Charles River by STARS of Boston,William,United States of America,1 review,June 19  2017,2.5,Entrance  is in active street had to watch for traffic.

Not only did it make noises and was a bit wobbly as we used the stairs. we noted several cracks near where the stair case is bolted into the mount. Definitely think this needs to be looked at as it may potentially lead to a safety hazzard.,Great location. Chinatown metro station is literally right next door.

Holiday Inn Express Boston,Anonymous,Canada,1 review,September 27  2017,6.3,I didn't realize the neighbourhood was a bit questionable. It was hard to find. There is a great mall adjacent but to walk over there at night I didn't feel was safe. It was very dark behind the hotel and that was the only passage way to the restaurants. We did have our car broken into while we were there. The manager said that the security didn't see anything and it was left at that. The parking lot could have been more lit up at night or have a security person watching at all times.,The room was lovely. clean and comfortable. Close to the mall.
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Ben,United States of America,1 review,September 15  2017,3.8,Didn't have my booking.com reservation and so held us up to try and rebook the room. which ended up being a different room. Also. cable TV. but no football game so had to watch on a small TV in the lobby with many others who were equally angry. The whole reason I booked it was for access to watch the game and it wasn't on in the rooms. Very poor hotel. do not stay here.,N/A

Holiday Inn Express Boston,Lisa,United States of America,1 review,September 9  2017,7.1,My daughter's laptop and charging cord went missing from the room. This was not discovered till we arrived at home the day of checkout. My daughter called the hotel and was told they would check with housekeeping and call her back. 3 days later I called myself and was abruptly told housekeeping didn't find anything and hung up on. The value of her laptop was not the issue vs things she had on it that can't be replaced.,When someone on our floor was smoking marijuana the smell came through our bathroom vent. I notified the front desk and was given a discount on the bill
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Jh,Ireland,6 Reviews,September 7  2017,3.8,The staff were friendly and the bed was big and comfy but this didn't matter as we were woken up at 7am after a late flight in to really loud construction outside our window. There was a huge amount of construction going on in front and to the side of the hotel and it totally disrupted our sleep and stay. We feel it was a total rip off for nearly 200 dollars a night. The breakfast was terrible also. Really bad quality hot food. we eat anything normally but couldn't eat any of this except for a banana and yogurt.We have never complained in all the time travelling to booking.com. we do around 6 trips a year but this we just had to complain about.The hotel is totally dated but it was clean to be fair.We were truly dissapointed and feel we should have been told before we booked how much construction was going on. We paid nearly $200 and feel $60 would have been enought for what we got!,N/A

Holiday Inn Express Boston,Carol,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,July 5  2016,7.9,Breakfast was very plentiful but need to be served longer. As a tourist I found the hotel a little out of the way. with taxis needed to visit anywhere.,All the staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and big!
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Pam,New Zealand,8 Reviews,July 4  2016,7.5,All the extra taxes added a lot to our costs,The staff were great- friendly. helpful. The shuttle was good too.Breakfasts good and replenished promptly. Well done staff.
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Michal,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,July 1  2016,8.8,Nothing about the hotel  just the traffic issue getting to it from Logan airport.First time in Boston wasn't aware of the route and used a GPS device that stopped working once you enter the tunnel system somissed turning and got lost also had to  pay twice for the toll,Comfortable bed. nice and quiet no noise issues
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Sara,United States of America,1 review,June 23  2016,7.9,N/A,Standard hotel stay near airport for convenience. A very short walk to the bus/tram station to get downtown.Really nice front desk staff. Male manager in late afternoon was so helpful. informative. and accommodating!
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Bjorn,Canada,17 Reviews,June 17  2016,7.5,Very rude person at check in counter. wanted to pay cash at check-in. and asked Her to guarantee me nothing would be charged to my Credit Card. she could not do that. and had it not been for Mr. Delroy Ferguson. who then appeared. I would have left. Delroy was able to satisfy me-as every Hotel has before-. and then made our stay with them perfect. He talked to us every day. and was helpful with any questions we had during our 4 night stay.....Many THanks to Him. a great Assistant General Manager.!!!,N/A
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Travis,United States of America,1 review,June 6  2016,8.3,The AC only had one fan setting that functioned even if two settings were on the unit itself to be choose from. Minor issue. easy fix for them.,The room its was comfortable for furnishings. The bathroom was dated. but had a soft reno not long ago. Overall it was a great property.
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Roman,United States of America,1 review,May 31  2016,7.9,Always locked door.Always should go to reception to unlock.Weather was rainy.The room is small.,Breakfast! Bathroom full of staff. Coffee machine in the room.
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Elizabeth,United States of America,8 Reviews,May 24  2016,10,i was not impressed w/ the lady who checked us in. not so accommodating. compared to the other lady who checked us out.,clean room. very good breakfast. i have nothing but praise for the lady in the desk who helped us store our luggages for a few hours &amp; got the shuttle for us to the cruise port. i forgot her name.

Holiday Inn Express Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,May 12  2016,4.6,3AM party somewhere in hotel sounded right outside my room then when that quieted down the couple started to have loud sex. walls must be of paper. We got up at 5 and left with out breakfast.,Close to Metro.
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Too,United States of America,1 review,May 10  2016,4.6,I reserved a cot for the room at 3:30. and when I arrived at 10:00 PM (they knew I would be a late arrival). all the cots were taken. I got an air mattress instead. It hardly fit in the tiny room....and was extremely uncomfortable. The room had barely enough room to do much of anything...had to move furniture to get the air mattress flat. For $400.00+ it was totally not worth it.,e to the shopping was convenient. the staff was friendly
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Corinne,United States of America,4 Reviews,May 4  2016,10,Nothing.  Everything was great.  I've stayed her for the last 4 years. and the hotel and staff never disappoint!,Everything.  This is a very comfortable. clean. friendly hotel.  They have a great variety of breakfast items to choose from.   Very close &amp; convenient to attractions!
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Ieva,Latvia,1 review,April 27  2016,8.8,N/A,At arrival we were greeted by a very welcoming reception - the ladies were really TOP friendly! They even called us to the room to tell our kids to come down when the warm complimentary cookies were served. The rooms were clean and comfortable. easy to access and safe. The breakfast had a huge variety of different food. all was included in price. Water and warm drinks available any time. The hotel had shuttle service with airport and convention center (the only technical problem we noticed was the broken safety belts in the car). For those who want to visit city center without car it takes some 10-15 minutes walk to the closest subway station. As we decided with our family. the biggest value of this hotel was its great heartful personnel.
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Ladislav Demko,Spain,39 Reviews,April 20  2016,3.8,Hotel overcharged my card 3 times. my stay was horrible experience. when stuff at hotel was constantly giving me wrong information about my credit card statements and after my departure hotel again overcharged my credit card.. GM hotel Mr. Wagner Quintanilha was making statements without giving any solid confirmations. Now I have night mare with missing and overcharged my stay. This was one of the worst experiences in my life with Holiday Inn.,Cleanliness...
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Ann,United States of America,1 review,April 12  2016,10,Only complaint is the parking lot is small for the number of guests.  The overflow lot should be paved and lined.,Very comfortable room that was clean.  The staff were excellent.  Would definitely here again when in Boston.
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Corinne,United States of America,4 Reviews,April 6  2016,10,This happens at ALL hotels. so this isn't just Holiday Inn. the maid sometimes forget to leave shampoo.  (They may mistake the lotion for shampoo.)  See "what I did like" for the wonderful response I received.,your staff is great!  they accommodate my every request.I requested 4 bottles of shampoo and conditioner and received 6 bottles of each. and a razer. comb. face wipes and bath bars.  Hooray!
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,March 27  2016,9.2,Breakfast options were the same thing almost everyday. Would've enjoyed seeing more food choices.,The shuttle service to the nearest train station was a very pleasant surprise. It saved a lot of trouble from driving and parking. Instead i was able to leave my car at the hotel most of the time.
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Hisham,Qatar,4 Reviews,March 22  2016,7.9,Only one thing; one staff member was kind of slow and non-responsive. may be he is noob but rest of staff was very helpful,- Location is near big supermarket and Apple Bees' restaurant. metro station (Andrew) was in walk-able distance.- WiFi signal was strong- value for money- cleanness and comfort
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Diana,Costa Rica,1 review,March 12  2016,7.9,There was not a subway station near the hotel and Downtown is not at walking distance so. if you dont have a car you will need a taxi and they take a lot or time to arrive when you call they. After having this experience all the days. only one person of the staff was worried for us and suggested me to take and Uber.,I like the breakfast (very complete and good taste and presentation). The shuttle service to Convention Center and the AirPort is very funtional. Very clean! Each day the y provide bath supllies. from shampoo to makeup cleaning wipes.  It is walking distance to South Bay Center where is a Target. TJMaxx. Marshalls. Best Buy. etc...and a couple of places to eat as Olive Garden and Applebees. Also a supermarket. A good place to rest!
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Lorraine,United States of America,2 Reviews,February 25  2016,7.9,The man working the front desk who checked us in was rude. Didn't even get a pleasant greeting as we walked up to the front desk. I was paying for the room with cash and had to leave a $250 smoking deposit. which was fine. but I asked if I needed a receipt to collect my deposit back in the morning and the man said no. $250 is a lot of money so after I dropped my bags off in the room I went back down to the desk and asked for a receipt for my deposit. I had to wait ten min or so after I kept saying hello for someone to help me. I asked the man for a receipt and he seemed pissed off about it and was rude. Other than this employee the stay was good.,Beds were comfy. location of property was nice. since we checked in around 1am. Shower was wonderful and the breakfast was great. A lot of items to choose from. The lady that checked us out in the morning was very pleasant.
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Catherine,United States of America,11 Reviews,January 7  2016,5.8,I could not sleep here!  That defeats the entire purpose of a hotel for me.  The building is structured so that you are immediately next to 3 other rooms. and the doors SLAM every time anyone enters or exits.  The air conditioning unit in my room did not work. so there was nothing to drown out the noise.  I guess when you stay here. you just have to hope that all three of the adjacent rooms are full of people who don't plan to stay up or enter/exit their rooms all night (which was unfortunately not my experience).,The facilities were nice (gym. business center).  There is another hotel right across the parking lot that had a small bistro for dinner options.
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,December 29  2015,9.6,I forgot my toothpaste and the room did not have any. They gave us a small packet of toothpaste at the front desk but it was hardly enough.,Appreciated the continental breakfast. The room was very nice.
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Josephine,Ireland,6 Reviews,December 21  2015,10,It's a pity their was no bar for drinks in the evening the only bar was located in the Hotel opposite closed at 10pm and very expensive.,Very convenient for getting into centre of boston great location.Bed really comfy.excellent stay would stay again.
Holiday Inn Express Boston,Nola,United States of America,11 Reviews,December 14  2015,9.6,room was standard. nothing to write home about and nothing wrong.security at doors inconsistant,location good. centralizedbreakfast was fantastic and they opened up early. Free parking was close. staff helpful.
Oasis Guest House,Michael,France,28 Reviews,October 31  2017,10,Couldn't find anything to dislike; the property very comfortably appointed. very well maintained &amp; is in a quiet road close to a stop sign so no speeding traffic noise. My wife &amp; I would definitely stay there again.,Breakfast was continental style with ample quantities of everything needed
Oasis Guest House,Anonymous,Canada,1 review,October 26  2017,7.1,We were not expecting the room to have shared spaces. It doesn't advertise the communal spaces very well (fridge. common room. bathroom.) It felt like a hostel style.,The location was great and we were so close to many shops and quite central. We found everything quite accessible and had the option to do a lot of walking. We were close to Foxbourough in order to watch the Patriots game and the train in was simple.
Oasis Guest House,Anonymous,Belgium,9 Reviews,October 22  2017,6.3,Location far from downtown Boston. Beds are too small. Staff not very friendly. and no staff means no wifi!,Good breakfast. You sit with the other guest in a circle.  If you want to be on your own you can sit seperate. I liked to talk with the other guests.
Oasis Guest House,Unkie,Japan,1 review,October 17  2017,9.6,Would be good to have some cotton earbuds as part of the amenities. Really I have no complaints whatsoever.,The bed was very comfortable and the water pressure in the shower was nice and strong. Would be good to have some cotton ear buds as part of the amenities as well. If you have a kid going to Berklee or Northeastern. this is a great property to try out. Friendly and helpful staff there too.
Oasis Guest House,Duanita,United States of America,1 review,October 16  2017,2.9,n/a,Very dated. not easy to locate because of no signage. RUDE front desk clerk. public alley parking is a JOKE - spot # 8 was very difficult to get in and out of.
Oasis Guest House,Donna,United States of America,6 Reviews,October 13  2017,9.2,I am a very light sleeper. Our room was on back of property and the building behind us was covered in massive a/c units which I could hear all night. Impossible to open window. Our room also shared a wall with the floors shared bathroom and guests are in and out of there with doors opening closing/fan on/ showering all hours. For a very light sleeper as myself this resulted in poor sleep.,Exceptional staff. Clean!! Excellent location. Lovely breakfast selections. With no elevator and we are in our 70s carried our luggage up a steep flight of stairs. Comfy beds. Adequate reading lighting.
Oasis Guest House,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 12  2017,10,Elevator. but there is no room for it. Staff  helped bring my bag up.,No big deal sharing the bathroom. I couldn't stay for breakfast but there was enough to pack up and take with me to my conference at the Hynes. It is a very homey place.
Oasis Guest House,Anonymous,Switzerland,2 Reviews,October 9  2017,7.9,Room was tiny. Very limited sound isolation between rooms (it was ok. everyone was careful). Real issue was the window which didn't block sounds from the  kids playground down the building. where people partying gathered on a Saturday night.,Quick and efficient check-in. comfortable bed. very clean shared bathroom. good breakfast. Very close to the green line and to coffee-shops. neighbourhood felt very safe (Berklee. college for music/theatre etc is down the road).
Oasis Guest House,Anonymous,France,18 Reviews,October 8  2017,3.8,Shabby small room unable to shut air conditioning off very expensive for what was offered. Ridiculous breakfast set up couldn't sit down anywhere as there was lots of people no proper tables,Location
Oasis Guest House,Anonymous,Australia,1 review,October 7  2017,7.5,Room was very small. Backed on to a service lane that was very noisy. Window did not have blockout curtains so the room was very light at night.,Location. price and style
Oasis Guest House,Philip,Australia,4 Reviews,October 7  2017,8.3,Bathroom ceiling fan wasn't working. Parking was in a dodgy area but nothing was disturbed after 2 days.,Location was good considering the price. Rooms are small. Staff were very helpful when we had to make a change to our booking and when we arrived.
Oasis Guest House,Carrienetta,United States of America,1 review,October 7  2017,8.8,The rooms are a bit dated but they were clean.,The staff was very personable and friendly. the location was within walking distance to everything and the area felt very safe.
Oasis Guest House,Christa,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 5  2017,8.8,Breakfast was definitely "continental" and there were limited options for my diabetic dad.,Staff was very helpful.  Provided lots of good recommendations and even lent us an umbrella on a rainy day.  Location good to Fenway. airport. and train station.
Oasis Guest House,Ellen,United States of America,1 review,October 3  2017,5.8,The wifi hotspot and one of the bedside lamps  didn't work.  What are the rules re: used.wet towels when you're sharing a bathroom?  Where do you leave them?,Tiny room was spartan but adequate and location was reasonably convenient
Oasis Guest House,Lawrence,United States of America,16 Reviews,September 17  2017,7.9,I could find no mention of parking accommodations on the website. before arrival.  Nor was the front desk reachable by phone. So. we had to park on the street. temporarily.  while we checked in. then we were told that their designated parking area ($25 a night) was full and we had to go to a parking garage ($33 for 24 hours. really not bad at all. especially if you want to linger in Boston the next day). The parking garage was actually quite convenient to the hotel and I wish I'd known about it ahead of time. It would've made our arrival much easier. I recommend that  before checking in. you go directly to the parking garage. above Whole Foods. at the corner of Edgerly Rd and Westland Av.,Location is perfect.  Whole Foods. Starbucks. Dunkin' Donuts. a number of restaurants all are an easy walk away. The accommodations are certainly adequate. clean. comfortable if not elegant. Very good value. for downtown Boston. where most hotels go for $100-$200 more per night.
Oasis Guest House,Kate,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,September 1  2017,7.1,Parking is less than ideal - the hotel offers parking for $25 a day on a "first come first served" basis. This sounded a lot. but we found parking generally pricey in Boston and there is no free daytime parking in the area. Daytime parking is restricted to 2 or 3 hour slots. We managed. taking advantage of free night time parking - ensuring we didn't park on a tow away night when street cleaning happens. and getting up early. so it is manageable but this is a good place to find another means of getting to the centre of town and not to have a car!!Coming from a chain hotel with incredibly friendly. helpful staff. I found the "personal" friendly touch that fits with a private hotel lacking. but maybe we just caught people on an "off" day.,The self service complimentary breakfast had a wide and attractive choice of breads and pastries. together with fresh fruit. yoghurt. dried fruit. nuts. cereals and juice. as well a tea and coffee. This was provided in the lounge (supposedly 6.30 to 11.00am. though quite a lot was being put out at 7.30. unless this was just topping up). which was available to residents all day and included daily papers and a fridge which residents could use. The rooms were quiet. One of the two our family had was quite small. but perfectly fine for a short stay.
Oasis Guest House,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 1  2017,9.2,N/A,The neighborhood was charming with flower boxes and a playground right down the street. You are in the middle of the city but without the constant flow of traffic. Great location for walking to major destinations. specifically Fenway.
Oasis Guest House,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 31  2017,8.8,They messed up my room keys and when arrived at 12 midnight I didnt find the keys where they toldMe they had places them. Had to ring a doorbell 3 buildings down and finally someOne came to open the hotel and room keys. I was in panic meanwhile!,Looks just like the advertisement. A modest and clean place to stay at a reasonable price
Oasis Guest House,Virginia,United States of America,1 review,August 25  2017,9.2,Steep. winding stairs and no elevator – some rooms not accessible to those with mobility issues.,Very helpful staff with great recommendations about the area!
Oasis Guest House,Yixin,Hong Kong,2 Reviews,August 25  2017,8.3,I was expecting a larger room - just a slightly larger room to accommodate that tiny single bed - however it was just that small! I would not say it is not a value for money given Boston appears to be a pricey city. but still. the room &amp; the blankets could be improved.,The location is very good - close to a subway station and many stores in the downtown.Very quiet in the night - the neighborhood is very good.Clean. nice guesthouse and friendly staff.
Oasis Guest House,Philipp,United States of America,1 review,August 24  2017,3.8,The room was very small and the bed uncomfortable. As it was also very loud early in the morning I didn't had a restful night. The staff was not helpful and even rude at one point. Parking was only possible in an expensive garage nearby. Overall not worth the money.,The central location.
Oasis Guest House,Anonymous,Portugal,4 Reviews,August 23  2017,7.1,My room had no air conditioning so it was really cold inside. The windows were old. and let in all the noise.The door didn't lock. So I put the warning on the door of do not disturb. Even though they came in to clean it. which I did not mind because it was only 2 nights. Luckily none of my stuff disappeared.The stairs were very tight and no one helped me with my luggage.,Good location. good cleaning
Oasis Guest House,Marieke,Germany,39 Reviews,August 10  2017,9.2,The price for one night is too high.,Good breakfast. super location (near the T. Haynes/Convention Center). Walking distance to the freedom trial (starting in Boston common Park). We had a room with a private bathroom. was perfect! Although too expensive (195€) for one night. Go to Pho Basil around the corner for the lunch. good Asian food for reasonable prices!
Oasis Guest House,Stephen,United States of America,1 review,August 2  2017,4.2,Price. $182 for an 8x10 room on the 3rd floor. Narrow stairs no elevator.  A double bed that just fit. Old style box tv very small up near ceiling. Bathroom down the hall and the light in bathroom didn't work. Informed staff and was told there was a working light in bathroom on 2nd floor. We are both in our mid 60's and require several trips to the bathroom throughout the night. Worst value for money during our whole trip which included London and Reykjavik,Nothing. Got in at 9 went to bed got up at 5
Oasis Guest House,Guillaume,Switzerland,1 review,July 29  2017,8.8,We had a very small room but ok for 1 or 2 nights for 2 people. For more I would need more space. Breakfast was good but not so comfortable to have it as there were no proper tables and chairs to sit down. which would be a little bit funny if the hotel is full and everyone decided to take their breakfast at the same time :) It is different from another hotel but this is not a complain because it offers breakfast which is better than nothing. Despite the small size of the hotel. we would be very happy to go back there again!,The staff at the reception was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is small but people at the reception are more knowledgeable and patient to explain about the city and other tourist things to do than in big chain (and overpriced) hotels in where we went to in the USA. Location of the hotel very convenient. next to the public transport. as well as to the campus (MIT. Harvard) and some restaurants. Room and shared bathroom very clean. Good breakfast. Connexion to the old city really easy by public transport!
Oasis Guest House,Carolyn,United States of America,10 Reviews,July 22  2017,6.7,I knew I would be sharing a bathroom.  I did not know it was with 7 other rooms.  Also for one entire day the toilet (only one) on the floor was not usable. had to go up one flight.  Stairs to go up to room were very tight with a 90 degree turn. One of the gentlemen staff was not particularly helpful or friendly.  The other was.,The location was great!
Oasis Guest House,Ross,Canada,3 Reviews,July 21  2017,9.2,The parking spots out back in the alley are very tight to navigate. so be careful.,The location is perfect for walk around tourism days. They have a clean. inviting atmosphere. It met all our needs.
Oasis Guest House,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 18  2017,7.9,Shower is super small and can't adjust shower head. Bed needs to be flipped and rotated.,I loved the location and it was super clean. Staff very friendly and helpful.
Oasis Guest House,Julien,France,1 review,July 1  2017,9.2,N/A,Nice little hotel. I really enjoyed my stay. My room was large. nice and clean. The street is quiet. The breakfast was simple (european style) . but completely OK for me. Wifi  is included and the connection was excellent.
Oasis Guest House,Left,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,June 29  2017,2.9,Does not explain what a 'shared bathroom' means - I expected to share with maybe one other room or have a Women's bathroom with showers. baths and a toilet. Instead you have to share one room containing a single toilet with a mixed bath/shower with the ENTIRE floor. Both men and women. It did not feel clean.There are no safety deposit boxes and the door handle on my room felt flimsy.,In a good area.
Oasis Guest House,Cris,United States of America,1 review,June 26  2017,10,I liked everything! I only have one suggestion. With the fruit stands around Haymarket. you may consider adding some fruit to the spread in the mornings.,I stayed with my best friend for our annual trip to Fenway. I was a little nervous. as I had never stayed at a "guest house" before. But no fear! I normally fly into Boston Logan and take the T whenever I come to town. I came in from the Mass Ave T stop (just a 10 minute walk). the Oasis is just around the corner from the Boston POPS so the Symphony stop on the Green E line is even closer. (Added bonus. the Boston Science Museum is AWESOME and off the Green E Line so it ends up being only a 20 minute ride with no transfers and short walk on each end to get there) To get to Fenway though. it was an easy 10 minute walk in the other direction.The area is very quiet. it seems like a family/student location. Berkley School of Music and Northeastern are very close. There was a nice playground right just down the street that was very clean. My friend and I felt very safe walking back from the ballpark after the games - about 11 pm.The hotel itself is a no-frills gem. Don't expect expensive furnishings or tacky decor to jack up the price. Simple rooms. but clean and comfortable. We had a private bath so I can't comment on the shared bath. But our room/bathroom was more than adequate for our purposes. We stayed in room 16 at the main house (there's an additional property a couple of doors down) so the breakfast area was right outside the door in this one. The Manager warned us that there will be some noise during breakfast but since we're not in town to sleep the day away. it was perfect for us.The area to eat breakfast. again. is not fancy. There's limited seating but it's set up so you can eat and talk with the other guests - don't be afraid to make friends! It's a Continental breakfast but well stocked. The pastries seemed fresh. the coffee was hot and good and their was a few extras. At checkout (11) they offered to store our bags since we weren't leaving until that evening.
Oasis Guest House,Jennifer,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 12  2017,10,N/A,Location was excellent. bed was comfortable. we had everything we needed! Online pictures depicted the property exactly as it was. Would definitely recommend this B&amp;B!
Oasis Guest House,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,June 11  2017,9.2,N/A,This is a fantastic accommodation from which to explore Boston.  You're within walking distance of the Museum of Fine Arts etc and other places of interest are accessible by short journeys on the T (subway).  I didn't have the breakfast that they serve every day. but it looked OK. Lovely guest house.  Extremely clean and run by very welcoming owners.  I would stay here again.  In some ways I preferred this guest house to a fancy hotel because it has more charm and personality and makes you feel as though you are inhabiting the city rather than being a tourist.  I would happily recommend this guest house.  If I ever visit Boston again I will stay here.  Loved it.
Oasis Guest House,Naomi,United States of America,9 Reviews,May 27  2017,5.8,This place was not charming or an "Oasis" by any means. Inside. or out. It was by far the most budget room I've stayed at in Boston. The size of a box really. If you are looking for a single room w/shared bath. you will get just that of course. but the quality was that of a motel. Point blank. Ugh. Plain. Drab. Cheap. And NOISY. If you are unlucky enough to stay in whichever corner of the building I was placed at. you will pick up the young activity from outside and upstairs etc etc.,5 min walk from the subway-only 2-4 stops to the city's center. and less than 5 min walk to eateries and other convenient stuff.
Oasis Guest House,Uktraveller,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,May 23  2017,7.1,Really quite pricey - after taxes. I paid over $200 for one night in a room that was hardly large enough to fit my luggage next to the bed. I did have a thoroughly lovely stay - but that's to be hoped for given the price!,Excellent location. friendly staff. clean
Oasis Guest House,John,United States of America,11 Reviews,May 21  2017,8.8,Bed in room 25 needs a new mattress. Shower is tiny.,Friendly and knowledgeable staff with plenty of advice about things to do in Boston. Squeaky clean public areas and room. Not cluttered with extra stuff--small but thoughtfully furnished. Great location walkable to art museums. Fenway Park. back bay. shopping. and good restaurants. Easy to meet other lodgers at the included breakfast buffet (no hot food). Close to a T stop for easy access to other parts of Boston.
Oasis Guest House,Ewan,United Kingdom,1 review,May 18  2017,6.3,Breakfast very basic for the price; no curtains. just a plastic venetian blind,Convenient with small but OK room and small but OK bathroom: very friendly welcome and nice firm bed

Oasis Guest House,Jieying,China,4 Reviews,May 1  2017,6.7,Mattress is toooo soft. my back hurts. And the bed is old / noisy whenever you move even the slightest. Shared bathroom (I didn't pay attention to this until checked in),Friendly staff; clean; good location.
Oasis Guest House,Anne,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,May 1  2017,8.3,Breakfast is OK but there was limited seating; it is self-service and there was only non-fat milk. Some people might not regard the choice of food or seating arrangements as adequate. The decor was entirely brown; dark brown carpets [understandably] but brown to beige everywhere else; walls. bed covers. etc. A little colour would cheer things up. There is no lift which may cause difficulty although there are some ground floor rooms.,Quiet. central location close to the Symphony Hall and MFA. Adequately comfortable room. Helpful people running it.
Oasis Guest House,Steven,Germany,18 Reviews,March 13  2017,9.6,N/A,Excellent service at the reception! We could also store our luggage after check-out. There's a PC to print documents if needed. We were also informed not to forget the time change. :-) Over all we had a really good time staying there.
Oasis Guest House,Bonnie,United States of America,1 review,February 27  2017,8.8,Mattress is way to soft and has worn groves. it should be replaced. Shower needs a place to put the soap and shampoos. Bathroom could use another towel rack.,Location to BOCO is great. Very helpful staff.
Oasis Guest House,Jill,United States of America,1 review,February 27  2017,7.9,Need more places to hang things like towels in room or shared bathroom.  Could use a freshening up in terms of decor. Breakfast included limited fresh fruit and what was there appeared older or overly ripe.,Location was great for Boston Conservatory visit.  Breakfast offerings were adequate.  Coffee was good!  Staff were pleasant. Shared bathroom was well maintained.
Oasis Guest House,Melody,United States of America,8 Reviews,February 20  2017,10,Can't say.  Maybe wider variety of fruit?,Did not use WiFi but available for free. Coffee hot. extra blankets available but really comfortable even with temps in the 20's. Staff great. Perfect location for Berklee or Fenway Park activities!!
Oasis Guest House,Anonymous,South Korea,3 Reviews,January 9  2017,9.2,The room is a bit cold. and there's no lift.,Lovely breakfast and very friendly staff. The house is always kept clean and cozy. The location was nice too. since the area was quite safe and beautiful. The MFA is 10 min walkinh distance and other tourist spots are within 20 min distance by subway.
Oasis Guest House,Nicole,United States of America,2 Reviews,December 31  2016,8.8,The room was a little small but that wasn't a big issue. It had everything we needed and we didn't spend a lot of time in the room anyways.,The location of the hotel was awesome. We were able to get to everything very easily by the T. We also got a free upgrade from a room with a shared bathroom to a room with a private bathroom which was great. It is likely because we went on a random Thursday so they probably had some extra rooms.
Oasis Guest House,Ct,United States of America,1 review,December 26  2016,7.5,Outside lights shone into the room and it was cold in the room.  Recommend black-out insulated curtains.  Noise was also a factor--I could hear each word spoken outside my window.  Walls and ceiling is thin and I could hear the pitter-patter of little feet above me.  I'm sure that most of that is living in an old building in a city.,Very clean and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  Breakfast was well done--tasty.  Staff was helpful with suggestions for dinner and how to get there.
Oasis Guest House,Ellen,United States of America,2 Reviews,December 6  2016,6.7,very step stairs. it was difficult to carry my luggage down when I left.  I don't recall reading that there were steep stairs.  I would not have been put off by stairs in normal circumstances but these were very narrow and steep.,location
Oasis Guest House,Victoria,United Kingdom,27 Reviews,October 24  2016,8.3,The room was fine but perhaps could have had a few more pictures . decorations as looked a bit stark.,Location was really excellent. There's a cosy seating area with window seats. The breakfast was fresh and staff helpful.   We would stay again.  Five minutes walk from the subway was a bonus too and with much of the historic district walkable from the guesthouse.
Oasis Guest House,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 9  2016,10,For us. nothing.,The staff (owners?) were exceptionally helpful both in planning our stay and once we were there.  The facilities were top notch. spick and span. attractive. all that we could ask.  Important to us. whoever was at the desk at the time provided precise. clear. and patient directions.  We were walking everywhere (to and from the "T" and then Fenway.

Oasis Guest House,Jld,United States of America,1 review,September 6  2016,6.3,Came here second week of August and it was hot. you cannot regulate the temperature of your room. Available assigned parking in alleyway behind hotel and the spots are only large enough for compact cars which are difficult to park in. Recommend using off site parking for a few dollars more. Really didn't feel there is a value for your dollar at this location.,N/A
Oasis Guest House,Michele,United States of America,1 review,August 21  2016,10,N/A,Both guys at the front desk were very friendly and accommodating with directions to our parking spot. gave us suggestions on what to do and see in Boston. room was plenty spacious for 2 people. and was very clean. We had a room with a bath but I also used the shared bath and that was very clean too. We only stayed one night but they allowed us to continue parking there the next day so we could tour the city for a reasonable additional $12.50. Definitely better than driving into the city further and fighting to find a spot and paying an outrageous amount there. The place was a 15-20 minute walk to the Boston park and gardens and a 10 minute walk to Fenway Park which is why we were there-for the Billy Joel concert. A great experience overall- we will definitely be back!
Oasis Guest House,Barbara,United States of America,1 review,August 18  2016,7.1,It is a little plain (room decoration). and still rather expensive. but I know this is Boston!,The front desk person in the evening. Rich. was very friendly and helpful.
Oasis Guest House,M,Japan,3 Reviews,August 13  2016,7.1,Air conditioning was too strong and very cold at night. It was manually adjustable by closing ventilator but it could not complete close.

Oasis Guest House,Rachel,United States of America,1 review,July 5  2016,8.8,There is one bathroom per floor. so I sometimes had a difficult time getting in.,This is a great guest house for those traveling on a budget. and close to a whole food supermarket if you. and provides free breakfast. A great value for your money.
Oasis Guest House,Jaymini,United Kingdom,9 Reviews,March 7  2016,8.3,There is nothing I didn't like. Just a note: if you have heavy luggage. bare in mind there is no lift and the stairs are steep and curvy.,• The guesthouse is in a good location: the area was lovely and felt safe. it was not far from some attractions; within walking distance to a metro stop and various shops and restaurants including a lovely Wholefoods Supermarket.• Staff were really helpful. We got delayed and couldn't make it within the check in time so the manager arranged to leave the keys in a mailbox and assisted us very promptly with this so we had no problems on our arrival late in the night. • The room was very clean and of a good size. The shower was small but it was still comfortable and it worked great!• It was good to have access to the kitchen and it's facilites.• Though we didn't try the breakfast. the coffee. boiled eggs and pastry options looked good if someone was in a hurry.• Not sure why the hotel is given 2 stars when it provided the basic necessities- towels. toiletries and a hair dryer!
Oasis Guest House,Anonymous,United States of America,4 Reviews,January 4  2016,10,The confusion with the hotel booking on the hotels part. I received confirmation from booking.com with the correct dates (Sat-Sun). however. the hotel sent a confirmation of (Fri-Sat). which would've been a problem had i not paid attention. The hotel seemed certain that friday-Sat was correct. in spite of my confirmation. so booking.com helped me out.,Friendliness of staff. convenience of location. free breakfast and quiet area
Oasis Guest House,David,United States of America,1 review,January 1  2016,10,N/A,What a FIND this was for us!  The Oasis Guest House is a perfectly located. tastefully renovated Victorian brownstone.  The rooms are cozy and clean. and the proprietors - Victor and Keith - were friendly. informative and helpful.  The plentiful complimentary Continental breakfast was a great way to start the day.  We'll be back!
Oasis Guest House,Perre,United States of America,2 Reviews,December 2  2015,6.7,Oasis Guest House is a converted brownstone. so you get a flavor for the longstanding architecture of the area. The pictures are accurate to the size: the inexpensive room I got was small. Shared bathroom on each floor.For the owners. there's one thing you can do to hugely improve the room: lose those acrylic bedspreads. They're ugly. date the place as 1980s. are rough to the touch. and on first opening the door. immediately gave me a sense that I was staying at a dingy motel. This isn't a dingy place. so that choice is unfortunate. Shortly after arriving. I removed that top blanket thing and tucked it into a drawer. Huge improvement: the off-white blanket hidden underneath suddenly elevated the room.,Oasis is an affordable option in an expensive city. Staff is friendly. they have a pleasant living room on the first floor where I met international visitors. It's a safe neighborhood. a block away from a pharmacy and a giant new Whole Foods natural grocery store.

West Broadway Quarters by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 23  2017,5.8,Small rooms with very poor sound insulation. You could hear everything from the kitchen. corridor or next room. Nowhere to hand towel in the room - bring earplugs.  No heating or AC that I could see so I would not want to stay when it's freezing outside or boiling hot.,Good bed. Very near T-line. Large bathrooms and well-equiped kitchen.
West Broadway Quarters by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 19  2017,8.3,Some trial and error to learn when regulating the room temperature. done by adjusting an air vent.,Amazingly easy to get to using the subway (broadway: Redline). as you come up to the street level stay to the right and it will be across the street.  Super convenient (I walked to Tufts Medical). clean. has the essentials. I stayed in the room with a shared bathroom. worked well. I believe there were 2 or 3 others sharing the bathroom. didn't bump into one another.  The rooms are basically a couple of feet bigger than the bed with a small desk and closet. but that's all I need.  Love the key code approach to building and room access. worked well.  There was little noise during my stay.
West Broadway Quarters by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 9  2017,6.3,While the room itself was fine. the common areas could use some work. The communal restrooms were right across from our room and were constantly in use. Since there is virtually no sound proofing. we heard people coming in and out of the bathrooms and their rooms all day/night. Guests are responsible for their own laundry (towels. sheets. etc.). There should be a vending machine for detergent. since most people will not by a bottle for just a few nights to wash their only towel (coin op laundry with no change machine). This is sold as a "rental". when it is really a hostel. Would have liked to know that upfront.,Great location. Right across from Broadway T stop.
West Broadway Quarters by Short Term Rentals Boston,Nik,Canada,36 Reviews,October 8  2017,8.8,A few cleaning oversights e.g.. paper towels out. Lots of city noise: planes. trains. trucks. sirens. Smell of smoke/vape. from air intake? Or guest? Customer service response did not match printed material with respect to early check in.,Excellent location. Good value. Comfortable. Clean and quiet enough (bring earplugs) for shared accommodation.

West Broadway Quarters by Short Term Rentals Boston,Matthew,United States of America,1 review,August 22  2017,9.6,The temperature was not adjustable in the room and the thermostat in the hallway was locked. With no ceiling fan in the room either the temperature at night was hot sometimes which made it difficult to fall asleep. Had I known this I would have brought a fan.,Liked the automated electronic codes. It made for easy in and out trips to the room throughout the day to drop things off and change.

West Broadway Quarters by Short Term Rentals Boston,College,United States of America,1 review,August 6  2017,9.0,I knew the rooms were going to be small. but they were a little smaller than I expected. Also. it would be nice if there was a phone in the property to directly contact the management company for issues (in our stay. one of the bathrooms was accidentally locked so the building was down one until the next day's cleaning -- other side is that there were only 5 rooms per floor sharong the 2 bathrooms).,Great location. decent common space. plenty of fluffy pillows. A pleasant. inexpensive surprise.
West Broadway Quarters by Short Term Rentals Boston,David,Ireland,1 review,August 5  2017,10,An elevator would have been nice as the tv room was on the top floor.,Exactly as it looked in the pictures.

West Broadway Quarters by Short Term Rentals Boston,Robin,United States of America,1 review,July 14  2017,9.2,Don't expect any views from your room,The rooms are impeccable. and the use of codes to get in works like a charm.

West Broadway Quarters by Short Term Rentals Boston,Diego,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 30  2017,7.5,Two bathrooms per floor to share with 6 rooms.

There was no elevator and my room was at the 4th floor.,Location is very good (right on top of the red metro station).  The place is clean. Very easy to have access to the building. rooms and internet. Internet connection was pretty fast.
West Broadway Quarters by Short Term Rentals Boston,Malika,United States of America,1 review,June 29  2017,7.0,It's only a room. without  facilities in a space you occupying.  but rather sharing.

West Broadway Quarters by Short Term Rentals Boston,Timothy,United States of America,1 review,June 27  2017,8.8,The room was a bit smaller than I was expecting. It was fine for what we needed for only a night or two but if you're planning on staying for an extended time. you may want to take this into account. They have some larger rooms there as well though.,The location is fantastic. it's right across from the Broadway stop on the Red Line. Even though there's not a lot in the immediate vicinity. you can get around quick. And there is a Dunkin and Starbucks right there to get your day started at least. :)We were nervous about shared bathrooms but they were clean and available whenever we needed them. The other guests were friendly and respectful. I was pleasantly surprised with the overall experience.

If you're two persons with two pieces of luggage. there is no change that you can move properly inside the room.- You cannot control the AC in the room. We were sick after two days due to the low setting. however even after complaining to the management. the temperature was not increased.- It's very very very loud inside the room - not due to the traffic. but due to the AC. which is very very noisy. And as mentioned above - you cannot control the AC. i.e. you can't turn it off.- We had dirty sheets when we arrived. After complaining the sheets were changed. however the new ones had stains on them as well.,- Subway station right across the street.

The room is tiny but I really just needed a place to sleep and store luggage so I didn't mind. It was a very short and cheap ride to the Boston convention and exhibition center. Also loved that the bathrooms are big and very clean. Kitchen is also very clean and equipped with microwave. fridge. toaster which is great.

West Broadway Quarters by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,May 28  2017,7.9,Nothing in particular.,This facility is an excellent option for those who are willing to give up a little convenience for more value of their money on lodging in Boston.  The location is excellent: red line subway is across the street.  Area is quiet and safe. and is in close proximity to downtown and most tourist attractions.  The facility itself is good too.  I loved their self check-in check-out process.  It was easy and convenient compared to hotels--no lines.  The room has a nicely written manual for visitors that pretty much answers most questions. such as transportation. dining options. medical facilities. etc.

The mattress whilst fine on my side was caving in on my husbands side which meant he kept rolling into the wall.No problem with access to the bathrooms and they were clean &amp; spacious.Great location next to the subway which had easy access into the city.

No black-out or curtains in the room. The room gets very light early in the morning. Also noise from employees in the corridor during the week.

West Broadway Quarters by Short Term Rentals Boston,Wesley,Canada,7 Reviews,April 20  2017,9.2,Only thing I did not like was I banged my knee/shin on the sharp corner edge of the bed's foot board. It is just at the right high to make contact with your lower legs and due to the narrow space between the end of the bed and the wall it got me a couple of times.Rounding or angling off the sharp corners would help or maybe some padded/rubber corner guards could be installed to eliminate the sharp right angles.,Bed were good and kitchen was well equipped.

I couldn't fall asleep for a whole night because of the noise. You can't control the heater. Also. the kitchen is facing all our bedrooms and there's no way for the smell goes out of the unit except our bedroom windows.

West Broadway Quarters by Short Term Rentals Boston,Evelyn,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 5  2017,9.6,The only problem we had is the central heater. As we were travelling in the early april. it's still cold. The central heater was so hot that we woke up in the middle of the night sweating!,I really love this place as it is extra close to the subway station (it is right across the subway station). The place is really great. clean and modern. The bathroom is really big.
West Broadway Quarters by Short Term Rentals Boston,Helen,United Kingdom,40 Reviews,March 29  2017,9.6,The aircon/heating system was very noisy and the room did get stiflingly hot at times.,Excellent location opposite the T station; easy access to accommodation using codes/keypads; small room but big comfy bed; shared bathrooms but spacious. clean and nearly always available; communal kitchen and lounge immaculately clean and well equipped. Last but not least. we left some chargers and an umbrella behind after checking out. and a staff member called Scott was most helpful in recovering them for us.
West Broadway Quarters by Short Term Rentals Boston,jjjustin,United States of America,1 review,March 28  2017,6.7,I never got an email with property access info. Texting their emergency number on the day-of was fraught with delays and poor communication. I should have checked my email in the days leading up to my trip. but that doesn't excuse their negligence and poor response time when escalated.,Good value. Good location. Our room was at the end of the hall and thus pretty quiet. I could hear other rooms from the hallway. though. so I imagine other less isolated rooms were not as peaceful as ours. Southie's a great neighborhood.
West Broadway Quarters by Short Term Rentals Boston,Darren,United States of America,1 review,March 27  2017,10,The nearest long term parking available to us was a few blocks away. I didn't mind but guests should be aware that they will have to walk a little bit.Not possible to lower the heat. I just used less blankets.,We stayed here for an event at the Boston Convention &amp; Exhibition Center. We walked to the convention center each day. since it was not too far from our accommodations.I liked that the property is unstaffed. so you can come and go at any time--and there is no special timeframe required for check in. For example you can arrive as late as you'd like. It's an introvert's dream.The rooms were quiet. and the other guests were courteous. Generally I couldn't even tell if there were any other people in the building.The rooms aren't exactly big. but they are clean. well-lit. with comfortable sheets and good heating. I wasn't in my room much except at night. so size of the room didn't matter to me.There is a reasonably sized communal kitchen and refrigerator for those interested in cooking during their stay.
West Broadway Quarters by Short Term Rentals Boston,Thomas,Taiwan,5 Reviews,March 27  2017,5.4,Terrible heating system. Too noisy. too hot (up to 28°C). too dry (11% humidity). You can turn it less hot by making it even louder. but you can't sleep then. Only way is to block influx of hot air with wet paper towels and put up wet towels all over the room to get humidity up. Got sick after 1 night there. the room climate might well have contributed to that. Stay away from this hotel except for the summertime maybe!,N/A

Walking distance to great local restaurants and the T station! Walking distance to the convention center if you are in good shape.
West Broadway Quarters by Short Term Rentals Boston,Teresa,United States of America,1 review,December 10  2016,9.2,Cons:  *No elevator.  This property would be damn near perfect if it just had an elevator.  The stairs are very steep and the rooms are on the 2nd. 3rd and 4th floors.*The rooms are TINY. with no TV.  But there are TVs in the common areas where you can sit and stretch out.*No staff on site.  We did not have a reason to contact them but I understand that they would have been available to call or email. should we have experienced a problem.*Only one set of clean towels was furnished for each of us to be used throughout our stay.  It would have been nice to have them replaced every 2nd or 3rd day. but overall. it wasn't a deal-breaker for us.  No bath cloth is furnished. so please note that you will need to bring your own.*I was VERY unhappy that they pre-charged the entire stay to my credit card over 6 weeks prior to the date of the stay.  I saw nothing on this site. nor in any communications from this site or from the property. that would indicate that this was going to happen.  I NEVER pre-pay for hotel or other accommodations. and certainly not 6 weeks in advance.  When I discovered this had been done. I asked to change the billing to a different credit card. but the company refused.,Pros:*Location.  Yes. this spot is technically in "Southie" but it's in a very safe area.  The street is well-traveled (both by cars and by pedestrians) in a nice location. and the front door of the building is. literally. directly across the street from the Broadway T stop.  There are 2 nice restaurants (one next door. one downstairs). a Teriyaki joint on the other side. a Dunkin Donuts on the other side of the teriyaki joint. another restaurant across the street. and a Starbucks right across the street next to the T stop.  At the other end of the block there is an upscale "craft" wine and liquor store. with an old-school diner across the street.  The next block features another restaurant. a gas station/convenience store. and down another block is another regular liquor store with GREAT prices! ;-)  There is also a Foodie's grocery store just past the aforementioned liquor store. You can hop on the T and be at the South Station in one stop (catch the free Silver Line Bus to the Airport here...trip to airport takes about 30-35 minutes via T and bus) and the next couple of stops are transfer stations to other lines.  EASY PEASY.  FYI. there is a CVS at South Station.*Free Wi-Fi throughout the building*Everything looks brand-new and was always spotlessly clean.  The rooms are tiny but there are two common areas where you can sit and watch TV.  The rooms are all white and feature what appears to be Ikea furniture. hardwood floors. and a small faux oriental style rug.  Our room (305) had a queen sized bed with nice. soft. white sheets. a down duvet. and 4 pillows. with a memory foam mattress.  The mattress was VERY comfy to me. but my fiance is quite a bit bigger and heavier than I. and he found the mattress to be very uncomfortable. probably because foam was too thin once his weight compressed it down to the under board. But most people of normal size to somewhat overweight (i.e.

West Broadway Quarters by Short Term Rentals Boston,Melissa,United States of America,1 review,October 19  2016,9.5,Boston is expensive but that is Boston I guess. Normally when I pay $300 for 2 night I don't have to share a bathroom. But at least there's nothing at all wrong w the place. Nice. quality people stay here so when you do run into them in the shared kitchen it's not weird. The windows could be a little more sound proof. It can get a little noisy outside and even with my window closed at night I still took a little longer to get to sleep than normal and woke up a couple times but Tylenol pm would've solved it. Really nothing else to even suggest for improvement. They've done a beautiful job. I would absolutely recommend for families. business trips. solo travelers. any situation that doesn't entail romantic getaway scenario.,So clean! Updated and modern. Bedding looked felt and smelled fluffy and very clean. Shared bathroom was also very clean updated and modern and there was always at least one of two available;I never had to wait. Location was excellent as the subway station is literally across the street. You just walk out. cross the easy-to-cross with crosswalk street and you are at the top of the escalator that goes into the station. Bus stop is also here. So is a Starbucks. Dunkin donuts is right next door. a convenient teriyaki chicken place plus more. Felt safe clean and comfortable the whole time. in the room and the neighborhood.
West Broadway Quarters by Short Term Rentals Boston,Zorica,Serbia,4 Reviews,October 19  2016,9.2,N/A,It's better from all of the hostels that I have been to because you have your own room. You have to share the bathroom with other people. but it's very clean and spacious and ours was right outside of our room. There's also a kitchen and a common room with tv. There is no front desk. They send you a code for the hostel and a room. It said that check in is from 4pm. but we got to Boston earlier and we were able to come in. And also on our last day. our flight was scheduled for 8pm and check out is until 11am. but we were able to leave our suitcases in the hostel and enjoy the most beautiful city on the Eastern coast for a few more hours.

There are other hotels near by with equal offerings and 2/3rd the cost. Or if you are willing to pay  1/4th more you can stay at one of the best hotels in Boston. The breakfast is very limited. a few bagels. some waffles. no healthy options offered. The pillows are not goose down. The bed is ok. but the sheets. the towels and the shower curtain is really old.,The good- Location is very good near restaurants (Yard House. Wahlburger. sweetgreens. panarea etc).

Standard fare. Very quiet. even on a Saturday night. Probably different when the Sox are in town. worth considering when booking. Very friendly staff.
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Back Bay/Fenway,Sharon,United States of America,8 Reviews,April 24  2017,9.2,Only complaint was not about the hotel. but across the street from our room. trucks made delivery's starting at 6 am with loud noises of loading ramps hitting the ground so maybe pick a room not on the west side of the building.,Stayed here before the Boston Marathon - great location as virtually across the street from Fenway ball park and a couple blocks off the marathon route.  The included breakfast was excellent in choices and quality.  Our room had a full kitchen and updated bathroom.  The rooftop deck/bar has a wonderfull view.  As it is mainly an outside deck. it might not be used much during bad weather.  Many restaurants nearby.  Hotel was great about it's support of the marathon runners which we appreciated.  Close enough to walk to the Boston Museum of Fine Art - don't laugh - we thought that would be boring but trip adviser gave it high marks so we went. expecting to stay an hour maybe - wound up there enthralled for two days!

Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Back Bay/Fenway,Tenebrae,United States of America,1 review,April 6  2017,9.6,I asked for a late checkout when I booked the room and again on the last day. When I booked the room. I received an email saying my request was approved for check out at 3pm since I wanted to explore the convention the last day. but the front desk told me that it could only be extended until 1pm. I said that I would check out at the time and left one of the members of my party at the hotel while I went to enjoy the last day. My party member told me that apparently staff began knocking at the door starting at 11:30am to kick her out until she finally said she had it and checked out an hour later. I had to leave early to help with the bags since I couldn't leave her in the lobby with all our bags. I did not appreciate that bit of miscommunication though I think next time I'll take the bags with me to the convention center and use their bag checkin while I'm there.,I loved the breakfast. It had an excellent variety of hot and cold cereals. eggs. sausage. pastries. greek yogurt. fruit and batter to make waffles. I'm a little sad I didn't notice the chocolate waffle batter until I was already stuffed. I also loved how there were a variety of condiments including hot sauce for those of use that love them in eggs.  The room was clean and a prime spot for me on the second floor. I know most people come there for Fenway but I was there for an anime convention so the lower level floor was actually good for me. The staff was really good about giving directions when asked. The convenience food and drinks for purchase on the first floor were a little expensive but convenient for late night snacking though I do wish there was some hard cider in the alcohol section considering it's what I personally like to drink but it's not a deal breaker.      The staff was very polite throughout the whole stay and it was something I definitely appreciated.

Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Back Bay/Fenway,Luisa,United States of America,1 review,March 6  2017,10,The hotel could offer more extras like toothbrush. little toothpaste.or body lotion. etc just in case sometimes we forget.,Everything in the room was set up very nicely!
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Back Bay/Fenway,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,January 2  2017,8.3,Pool hours could've been longer. Because the pool is small and there were younger children in the pool it didn't create an environment that was conducive for us (traveling with older teens) to use the pool. Wish parking was included,Staff very courteous and knowledgeable - they really welcomed us and provided great info on the area.  Great kitchen amenities in the room. Bed very comfortable. Awesome location!!!! Can't beat the location for old town trolley pickup. places to eat. access to the T.Shout out to the Bartender (Katie) who was welcoming and engaging. Second time staying at this location and will definitely do it again!
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Back Bay/Fenway,Kenta,United States of America,2 Reviews,December 17  2016,9.6,N/A,the location is great because there is a station within 5 min and you can eat anything around there. and if you want some stuff. there is a Target close to hotel. It's really convenience.
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Back Bay/Fenway,Bill,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 6  2016,10,What I didn't like was that I couldn't check in till 3pm when I asked for a early check in of 12pm. So I couldn't even enjoy the room for a full 24 hours since check out the next morning was at 11am. I would have loved to send more time in my room that I paid almost $500.00 for.,The room was more then I expected
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Back Bay/Fenway,Katherine,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 9  2016,10,N/A,The bad and bedding were exceptionally cozy and comfy!

The room was kept spotless and well supplied with everything we needed at all times.
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Back Bay/Fenway,Kimberly,United States of America,1 review,August 31  2016,7.5,Little steep in price.,The breakfast was really delicious. Rooms were clean and good sized. Nice bar and restaurant downstairs. Super convenient to Fenway for games.
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Back Bay/Fenway,Michael,United States of America,1 review,August 23  2016,9.6,I do not like have to pay an additional $45 to park my car.  I realize parking in Boston is tight. but it should be included in the nightly rate.,Unusual room layout but we loved the setup.  We usually get a suite (at other hotels in Boston) but this worked out just fine).  Modern bathroom has a very spacious shower (no tub) that we loved.

Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Back Bay/Fenway,Gerald,United States of America,10 Reviews,May 30  2016,9.2,The breakfast was not good even when expectations going in were low as is usually the case at these types of free breakfast hotels. This one ranks on the low end for sure,Great spot to stay for our First visit to Fenway
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Back Bay/Fenway,Khalil,United States of America,14 Reviews,May 12  2016,9.6,No complaints about the hotel itself. the staff. or the area. If I had to name something I didn't like. I would say the price. I got a discounted rate for my stay that I was satisfied with paying. but I've looked into coming back a couple of times. and the usual rate is a bit pricey. even after factoring in perks like the surrounding area. Nonetheless. if you're lucky enough to get a discounted rate or to have a corporate account covering your stay. you simply can't do better in the Fenway area than this hotel.,New hotel in an amazing location near Fenway Park as well as a major shopping center with various restaurants and bars. Very easy access to public transportation (bus. train. cabs). but located in a safe area to walk around if the weather is nice enough to allow for that. Very friendly staff. from the check-in desk to the Valet staff. and speaking of which. this hotel offers very convenient on-site parking for folks with cars. The rooms are spacious. clean. modern. and the beds are very comfortable. Internet is fast and reliable. Most impressively. the rooms are quiet despite being in the middle of a busy area.
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Back Bay/Fenway,Azza,Egypt,1 review,April 25  2016,6.3,Breakfast was really bad. unhealthy. cheep paper cups and plates and plastic forks and knives. the food was not taste at all...,location was convenient. room was spacious enough
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Back Bay/Fenway,Kevin,United States of America,3 Reviews,April 23  2016,9.2,It cost an arm and a leg. but you have to expect that when you got to Boston on Patriots' Day weekend.,The staff proactively caters to the Boston Marathon crowd.  In other cities. I might ask for a late check out to accommodate my schedule as a runner.  Here. the staff volunteered information like. "We'll have yogurt at 4 AM in case you have to catch a bus early."  And there *was* the complimentary breakfast before I had to catch that bus to Hopkinton.  And there was a post-marathon waffle bar. great for my post-marathon See Food Diet.
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Back Bay/Fenway,Jess,United States of America,1 review,April 23  2016,9.6,I was disappointed that the pool was so small and there was no hot tub.,The room was spacious/comfortable. the complimentary breakfast was great (especially the waffle bar). and the hotel is just a short walk to and from the Kenmore T stop. The staff were friendly and very accomodating. If you are looking to save money. the kitchenette in the room was great for cooking dinner. There are also alot of restaurants within walking distance if you prefer to eat out.

Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Back Bay/Fenway,Leigh-ann,United States of America,2 Reviews,January 19  2016,10,N/A,Staff was more than accommodating! Helped us book an extra night at an amazing value due to my mom staying at Brigham and Woman's hospital an extra day after her cancer surgery. And made my 11 yr old son feel at home and special with a lobster shaped lollipop and ice cream! Couldn't have asked for more from a hotel. Really felt like they cared and helped me.

Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Back Bay/Fenway,Debbie,United States of America,1 review,November 7  2015,7.5,Recommend putting people with dogs near the elevator- also would be nice if there was a grassy area near the hotel for dogs.  Dog treats on arrival would be a nice touch.  Foot stool in front of couch so you could work and put your feet up.,roof top great. staff friendly. Stiven was very friendly worked then bar one night and then the breakfast area enjoyed speaking with him.

Evolve East Boston,Bonnie,United States of America,8 Reviews,October 14  2017,2.5,I booked this property three weeks in advance of my trip. I had mentioned that I would be arriving late.  I didn’t hear back from anyone indicating that they close at 11:30 and are not staffed. When I arrived at midnight. the property was locked and no one was there.  I was stranded on the street in east boston. The number for the hotel was an automated one and not one person was available to talk to me.  I was charged for the night and still cannot reach a single human person about this property. I feel like I was robbed and intentionally left in a dangerous situation.,N/A
Evolve East Boston,Anonymous,Canada,10 Reviews,October 11  2017,4.5,The room had not been cleaned after the previous guest. The host accommodated us at their sister property which is nice but the new accommodations smelled a little musty. the wifi didn't work and we had to pay $30 for parking to later find out they should've provided a parking pass per the letter on the fridge. I emailed the host about these concerns when we were finally settled in the room but I have yet to hear back.,N/A
Evolve East Boston,cemjohnson,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 13  2017,5.4,I arrived to a locked door with no attendant on duty.  When I was given a key. it only worked on the apt and not the building entry doors (attendant didn't know how to fix that).  I was denied the parking sticker initially. but they decided to let me buy it after I returned and explained my lack of options.  I was told the neighborhood was safe to walk around in... but I wouldn't agree based on what I saw.  There were no recognizable food options that were nearby. with the exception of Burger King.  I was hoping for something a little healthier.  In the morning I was frustrated to find the room was not equipped with a blow dryer.  It was a bad hair day :(  Overall my experience could have been improved if the person at the front desk was more knowledgeable and more helpful.  I dealt with two of them and they were both lacking - it was like it was the first day on the job for each of them.,It was a nice building with good facilities. although I wasn't there long enough to use any of them.  It was also very close to the airport and the subway station.
Evolve East Boston,Trista,United States of America,1 review,September 5  2017,3.8,When we arrived. the whole suite is not cleaned. like the last person who lived there just left. they changed us to a different apt. which is great. but still. we couldn't go anywhere the entire nite.,Really close to the subway and to the airport.
Evolve East Boston,Fan,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 15  2017,8.3,Parking is limited. You have to move your car before 10 am because the 2-hour street parking is allowed until 8 am. I recommend travelers choose this hotel if you don't have a car.,Very helpful and friendly staff. The 'hotel' is actually an apartment building for rent. Subway station is one minute walk away. Some fast food restaurants and supermarkets are located within walking distance.
Evolve East Boston,Hiroko,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 9  2017,7.5,took too long time to receive a parking pass. so we could not wait to get it. I had to call the office and waited for it to send an email to the front office at the hotel or the apartment. but they did not do it quickly in the morning so I had to drive to Boston. instead of parking my car at the hotel and using the public transportation. I have no idea if they would let you do this. but it may be a good idea to call the office before you arrived at the office so that you would be able to receive a parking pass quickly.,very clean. and close to the metro station (about 3 minutes by walking).
Evolve East Boston,David,Austria,9 Reviews,August 8  2017,7.1,Check in was difficult. the apartment needs better out of business hour access. I had to wait for an hour for someone to arrive at reception (early evening break for receptionist). I had to get a local resident to let me into the lobby. Tried for to phone someone without success. nobody answered as it always went to voice mail.,Lots of space. good location. modern.
Evolve East Boston,Neal,United States of America,11 Reviews,July 28  2017,5.0,1.

Evolve East Boston,John,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,July 27  2017,5.4,Absolutely no service whatsoever... It is essentially and AirB&amp;B with Hotel pricing. I had a problem with my suite and the front desk had no clue. It took calling the owners to drive ppl to the site to address the issue.It costs about the same as the Embassy or other luxury hotels nearby. Go there instead.,The apartment was very comfortable and clean.
Evolve East Boston,Riccardo,Italy,1 review,July 25  2017,7.1,Parking is not included as specified by Booking.com. and the employee at Reception didn't mention about a parking option.,the apartment is nice and everything is clean and well organized.
Evolve East Boston,Ronen,Israel,5 Reviews,July 20  2017,4.6,A terrible experience! Definitely would not go back. The apartment was nice and clean. but the service was horrible and rude. We were 4 people and got only one blanket. When we asked repeatedly for another blanket we were completely ignored. When we left they tried to charge us 150$!!! For the key which they claimed they could not find. although we left it on the kitchen counter as they requested! Luckily we took a picture of the key on the counter (also to their request!). left in a hurry and forgot to send the the picture. After a couple of hours we got an email threatening to charge us with 150$ for the “missing” key. My guess is that they ask for the picture and when they don’t get it they charge you for a “missing” key. Easy money for them.,N/A
Evolve East Boston,Damon,United States of America,6 Reviews,July 2  2017,5.4,We brought our 15 year old daughter and she was expecting to sleep in a bed. In this case there was a couch bed in the same room as the queen sized bed. However. the couch bed was not functional and could not be used due to prior damage to the frame. I ended up sleeping on the couch for two days until I decided to look more into it. to at least use the mattress for more sleeping space than on the couch.Due to recent construction. the work crew started early 0545 hrs and the view that was expected of the bay was completely blocked. The pots and pans were dirty although there were plenty to use for our stay. I attempted to contact the staff. but did not receive an email or phone call during our stay.,I liked the fact that the amenities were available (i.e. stove. fridge. microwave. and utensils). Wi-Fi was convenient and the location had secured access 24/7. The location was good to the water and easy first floor access. Access to a washer and dryer in the room was convenient and it worked well. The bathroom was clean along with the sheets and bedding.The gym was nice and clean. The activity room was nice to relax in.
Evolve East Boston,College,United States of America,3 Reviews,June 30  2017,7.1,Early morning construction. Not a very nice neighborhood. Expensive to get into downtown or anywhere bc subway from location is inconvenient. Most uber drivers told me not to take the subway bc it is the slowest line! The info from the website was misleading on this.,The apt was well kept and amenities were well thought out.
Evolve East Boston,Mario,United States of America,7 Reviews,June 13  2017,5.8,Check-in could not have been more confusing. Its a new water-front condo/property that rents out some nightly studios as a hotel. There are no signs for Evolve. rather for the community "Portside at East Pier". &amp; no front-desk person that can help.We arrived around 11:30PM. which was noted on my reservation. yet the security person said he had no instructions that anyone would be checking in. About 25-30 min later. he received the OK from someone &amp; we were able to get keys. Security showed us to our rooms.These are studio apartments. not 1 bedrooms. so just note that if you are expecting some privacy (non-couples). Checking-out. the desk person couldn't have cared less about anything...which sort of sums up what this place is.,Night security was vital in getting us checked-in. Fortunately. we caught him before he left for the night or we wouldn't have been able to check in.
Evolve East Boston,Leo,United States of America,5 Reviews,June 13  2017,8.3,Having no place to leave luggage so we could have  checked out. eaten breakfast in Boston and made it back without worrying about going beyond the 11:00 a.m. checkout time would be something that could be improved.,The location was good except it was difficult finding a place for breakfast nearby.  I was never certain that I did in fact have a reservation. Communications giving a firm confirmation would be great. Asking for a photo I.D. after paying but before arriving was confusing. A credit card usually is enough to ensure an agreement with a client.The front desk personnel were great and even helped get the tv up and running!
Evolve East Boston,Anonymous,Netherlands,10 Reviews,May 28  2017,5.0,When we booked we had asked for a parking space. However. we arrived at 12.00 h and only then we realised that is was not a "normal" hotel with a reception. So we could not park the car as the concierge of the apartment house was not informed that we ordered a parking space and without that he was not entiteld to allow us to park on the parking lot. In the whole neighbourhood we saw cars being towed away. So parking the car on the street was not an option. Finally. we found a parking space at the park a little bit further on. The police agent we met there told us that the neighbourhood was dangerous and that there are gang fights. We felt very unsafe but left the car there to visit the city. We came back at 16.00h. The key we got from the concierge opend a room that was already rented. So we went back to the concierge. He gave us a new key. The key opend to a room that was not yet ready. We got a little bit tired of the whole situtation. At several moments we had tried to call the company that rents these apartments. However. we never got through. E-mails we send were answered alsways too late.,Compared to hotel prices in the city centre. this appartment seeemd to be good value for money as you can reach the city centre by subway within a few minutes. However. we now wonder if the headache we got from this stay was worth the saving.
Evolve East Boston,Michelle,Singapore,1 review,May 15  2017,5.8,The dining table is too high not friendly for elders nor children.  No hair dryer which is essential. Not enough bars or hooks in toilet to hang towels or clothing while showering.,The room is well equipped and spacious.  The furnishing is new and there is a pull out queen bed that sleeps two.
Evolve East Boston,Antonia,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 13  2017,9.2,Can't check in early . which is ok .but the main problem is that there is no place to leave luggage to be able to go off and do something before the 4:00 check in,Great location. Easy access to use the T.
Evolve East Boston,Ke,China,1 review,May 8  2017,4.2,There is a VERY LOUD construction site just outside the room that starts from 6am to 3pm.There is no ceiling light in the bedroom. Only a small bedside lamp works in the area.The sofa bed is uneven.The staff is hard to get in touch and did nothing when received my complaint. not even replying my email.Besides. they don't have luggage storage service. So if you arrive early than 3pm. you will have to wait outside with your stuff unless you are willing to pay extra 75 dollar.Once again. DONT BOOK THIS PLACE if you have the chance. It is unbearably loud in the morning. Totally ruined my trip.,The only good thing is the location. Close to the subway station.
Evolve East Boston,Ellen,Ireland,1 review,May 8  2017,9.2,No luggage room to store bags before checking in/ after check out. We went to the aquarium after check out and they held our suitcases while we were there. until we left Boston .This place probably wouldn't suit a family. we were 3 friends on holidays but one room. one double bed and a sofa bed might not be great with young kids,An apartment not a hotel so self service with oven. fridge . microwave. iron. Some might not like this. but we thought it was really convenient. The location was really great- subway stop right outside the building and only 2 stops into the city. Beautiful views out back onto the harbour and city
Evolve East Boston,Diego,United States of America,3 Reviews,May 7  2017,3.8,-  Checking in was a mess. took one hour to get us in the suite.-  Parking was not available the first day and I was still charged.-  The bed sheets for the kids sofa bed were never delivered.-  There was trash in the kitchen that was never picked up. we had to take it ourselves.-  Wi-fi service was not available in some areas of the complex that were critical for connectivity like the lounge where I was trying to do some work.,N/A
Evolve East Boston,Matteo,Italy,23 Reviews,May 2  2017,3.8,The check in was terrible: even though we wrote two emails stating that we were arriving earlier than 4pm we never had an answer (our documents and credit card were asked twice by the staff instead). Noone on site could help and we couldn't leave our luggages. so we lost the afternoon to visit the city.No services whatsoever in case of issues during our stay (e.g. the coffee machine did not work). The staff on the phone was quite unfriendly.There is a construction site in front of the appartments so forget to sleep longer than 7am in the morning.The second bed was V formed. dirty. and not suitable for two persons.,Large room. kitchen and washing maschine includedGood idea to put apartments in this area but extremely bad managed
Evolve East Boston,文洁,China,6 Reviews,May 2  2017,10,N/A,Very very good location. 2 minutes' walk to the subway station. If you arrive late in Boston. or need to take early airplane. this will be very wise choice.
Evolve East Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,April 30  2017,5.0,- Flat smelt of rotten vegetables (sink issues).- The kitchen was poorly equipped.- There was nowhere to leave my suitcase in the complex. This was particularly irksome as check-in was very late (4pm). so I  was dragging my bag around much of the day.- The service was poor- did not get back to one. were brusque. borderline-rude. and were extremely inflexible. I would not find this service acceptable in an organising arranging much cheaper accommodation. never mind one which is described as being 'luxury'.,Comfortable bed; close to airport
Evolve East Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,April 13  2017,7.9,3 bath towels for 4 people?

Hard to reach someone.)They told us we could type in a number at the buzzer at the entrance and then go straight to our room.We couldn't even enter the building because the buzzer didn't work.So we were offered another room at a different location which we accepted. Otherwise we would not have had an accomodation for the night.The new location (Watermark building. Cambridge) was nice and the view from the roof terrace was amazing. but we expected there to be linens for the couch since we booked a room for four people. Two of us had to sleep on the plain mattress of the sleeping couch. That is disgusting - how many people have slept on that before?! Same with the blankets and pillows. There was just one pillow with a pillow case. the other one did not have one. Again. disgusting and not hygienic. There was no case for the blanket/comforter in the living room. How many people have used that before?! The bed in the bedroom was nice. but the bedding for the sleeping couch was not satisfying.There should have been a note somewhere in the room details before booking the room that there is no/not enough bedding for four people in that apartment.,The view from the roof terrace and that we could store our luggage at the concierge on the day we left.
Evolve East Boston,Ceridwen,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,April 5  2017,4.6,1.. Appt stank of rotten food (smell coming from kitchen sink).2. Check-in was very late (after 16:00) yet there was nowhere to leave your luggage until the room was available. This apt presumably caters for clients flying into Logan airport. The organisers really should make a baggage room available.3. Communication with Northeast Suites who organise the property was difficult. They did not get back to one. were terse and unhelpful on the phone. and generally treated one as if one was just a major inconvenience. The whole process of booking through them and Booking.com was a real trial and I will never do it again.4. The TV did not work properly but kept losing signal. This happened on multiple days and on multiple occasions.,Easy access to netro
Evolve East Boston,Laura,United States of America,6 Reviews,March 31  2017,10,N/a,Loved location close to the Maverick train stop and the water view- skyline of the city at night was beautiful.The condo was impeccable and fully furnished beautifully.  Security guard at entry way and double doors; felt very secure.
Evolve East Boston,Alex,United States of America,3 Reviews,March 7  2017,5.4,No on-site Evolve representative. The apartment building had a front desk but offered no information or help for our stay. Completely independent. No luggage storage. We reallyNeeded this for the next day waiting for our flight. Had to lug our luggage into Boston in a snow storm. Could not leave it at property like any normal hotel. Apartment staff would not let us. They wanted to charge $75 for 3 more hours (late checkout). Cleaning staff was breathing down our neck knocking 2-3 times starting at 9am even though checkout was at 11am. Evolve had no one on site to help us with late checkout (IT WAS A NOR'EASTER 2-9-17) had to keep luggage with us in said NOR'EASTER. THERE WAS NOWHERE TO GO. Extremely unaccomdating. If you are going to advertise as a HOTEL. you need luggage storage. someone at the front desk ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR COMPANY. and for God's sake. a HAIR DRYER. also. call the cleaning crew off. Disruptive BEFORE CHECKOUT TIME. Will not be using Evolve again. nor will we be recommending them. unless some compensation/customer service for this hassle is provided. Lastly. I left the keys on the counter as instructed. but was texted later on and asked if I accidentally took them with me. Cleaning crew possibly misplaced them. I had to send a timestamped picture of keys on counter to serve as proof of my side of the story. I've never had to do this at any hotel/BandB/etc. Had there been someone to leave the keys with. this would be a non issue.,New. comfortable. free wifi. convenient to Boston

Evolve East Boston,Douglas,United States of America,1 review,January 22  2017,6.7,There was no shuttle to get to and from the airport.  We could not check in until 4 pm and we had nothing to do because we did not know Boston.,The view from the apartment.
Evolve East Boston,Niall,Ireland,21 Reviews,January 17  2017,10,Some confusion at check in over the apartment and car parking. but street-parking is free at the weekend. Towels. are not changed. but you can turn them around in the washing machine. Not many places to eat (burger king) or decent supermarkets nearby.,Location. location. location. one stop from the Aquarium. it is basically an apartment rental. the staff at the front desk are very helpful.  We left the car idle for the five days we stayed.
Evolve East Boston,Carlos,United States of America,1 review,December 24  2016,7.1,The heather in the didn't work. The room was freezing! I've asked the concierge about how to adjust it and he said that he didn't have a clue of how to fix it. And said he will come back with a solution and he never showed up. It was very disappointed. I don't think I would choose this place next time.,The place was very clean in general. very quiet. I love it!
Evolve East Boston,Josephine,United States of America,1 review,November 18  2016,10,Apartment only had 2 lamps making the place very dark.  It was difficult to see when we were packing.  Also. it needed more hangers in the closet.  They only had 4.,Modern facility. very spacious. well equipped and so close to a T stop it was easy to travel around Boston.
Evolve East Boston,Sonia,United States of America,6 Reviews,November 10  2016,9.6,It was impossible to leave our luggage at the reception as we arrived early and had a late flight !

Evolve East Boston,Mike,United States of America,1 review,October 29  2016,9.2,Learned that property was located near a not so reputable area.  Several people at local businesses recommended that I should use caution while walking around.,Great room for a great price. Really nice inside.
Evolve East Boston,William,United Kingdom,45 Reviews,October 24  2016,6.7,There were few 'extras' compared to a hotel. Not sure how many units are let on a short-term ad hoc basis. It was fine for the first night of our trip. but no more than that.,Evolve is close to the airport so is convenient as a place to stay on arrival. The 'units' are essentially studio flats - suitable for four adults. There are a few small shops just over 100 metres away. It is not really geared for holiday travellers.
Evolve East Boston,Alana,Australia,6 Reviews,October 18  2016,7.5,We were under the impression that we could get a taxi to airport easily but had to get reception to call cab company twice and then they only sent 1 cab for 6people. Thankgoodness my son-in-law tipped the cab driver they had $20 to come back and get my husband and myself. We almost missed our flight to Texas. Because of all the work going on around hotel the cab drivers didn't seem to know where the entrance to the hotel was.,We liked that it was close to downtown Boston by way of the subway.
Evolve East Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,23 Reviews,October 18  2016,8.3,Bedroom was NOT self contained as originally described. and there was no bedding for bed settee for my sister and none was available!

Evolve East Boston,jprobst,Luxembourg,20 Reviews,October 8  2016,8.8,Appartement building. Not hotel. Not allowed to leave trash in the room. 2nd bed was not ready at arrival and no one on site. Had to transform the couch into bed by ouselves.,Right beside the metro in a new building
Evolve East Boston,Maciek_K,Poland,35 Reviews,October 7  2016,8.3,Personnel was rather unreliable and unpleasant - despite a few requests I received check-in details only one day before arrival and on the departure day morning somebody was entering the apartment every 20 minutes to verify if I had already checked out.,Apartment and block is brand new. comfortable. well equipped and ideally located - close both to the airport. city center and tube station and at the same time very close to the channel shore with beautiful view over the city. Pretty expensive however...
Evolve East Boston,William,United States of America,7 Reviews,October 3  2016,5.4,No 'view' as promised; just construction. It was in a very much working class neighbourhood. I felt very much in the minority. We were told we would be able to check in before 1600. but the lady refused to even check; even at 1550. she made us wait so we wasted a whole day of our holiday as we had a suitcase that we couldn't drag around. One of the lights didn't work. so we sat basically in the dark in the living room. The air vent over the cooker didn't work either. Look for towels in the bedroom closet: we didn't find them until the second day and were sharing the one towel left out.,Nice to have a full kitchen and a washer and dryer. Comfortable bed. It was nice to walk to the river and watch the sunset and Boston light up. The neighbourhood. whilst not the best. at least offered a grocery shop and some restaurants in walking distance. Was handy for the metro.
Evolve East Boston,Kathleen,United States of America,14 Reviews,September 29  2016,9.2,The early check-in was not an easy process. it was tough to find a person to let us in. and then they had no information about us checking in early (which we paid an additional $75 to do). There needed to be better check-in directions provided and coordination with the facility. And a small thing. there are notes all over to take out the trash when you leave. but does not tell you where to take it.,The location to the Maverick Metro Station was 1/2 a block away. It was convenient to airport and downtown Boston.
Evolve East Boston,Kr1x,Spain,21 Reviews,September 18  2016,4.2,No One responsible physically in "Northeast suites apartments". so just we arrived to the apartments. our parking had not been notified. so. the consierge only knew to say. that he had not any email from "Northeast suites apartments" in which it is said that we had a parking reserved.I had to contact with somebody via email. and nobody answered me till next dayThe problem. that I see. is that you reserved through Booking.com. but "Northeast suites apartments" managed everything. and the problem is that they must not be  reading what you have reserved via Booking.com.....I had problems too with the pay . where I had problem with my credit card . even I dont know still the reason. and of course the parking..... at the end. my car parked a night on the street. that I had already paid to them......,Cool apartment.Close public transport to the town.
Evolve East Boston,Anonymous,Switzerland,5 Reviews,September 18  2016,7.1,Not easiest to find but luckily our Uber driver stopped right in front of the entrance. Only says "East Pier" on the outside. Since this is an apartment building which receives the bookings from Northeast Suites there's no one on site to help you with your concerns. There are super friendly concierges which try helping but don't know all the answers. Also they're only around until 12pm and since there's trouble with the keys (only with the main door. they work perfectly inside the buidling) you can't get in the building after midnight. They should organise themselves and inform the concierges better about their policies so you don't need to write to or call the customer service. p.e. there are various signs that remind you to remove all trash from the apartment but they don't say where to bring it and the concierge didn't know about it. No possibility to store your luggage if you have an evening flight. We used Rowes Wharf Water Transportation: Luggage storage and water taxi to the airport for $20/pers.,Apartement was spacious and comfy. There's a TV/Billard room including iMacs for all guests to use. Good location for airport (1 metro station) and only 2 stations to the city. however there's not that much food in the area -luckily there's delivery!
Evolve East Boston,Janki,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,September 15  2016,5.0,Customer service by Northeast Suites was dreadful no response to calls or email on arrival.

Evolve East Boston,Patricia,United States of America,1 review,September 2  2016,5.8,I didn't like that it was so hidden and extremely difficult to find.The address was not on the gps maps yet. It took us 2.5 hours to findthe apartment complex and we were only 7 miles away. It was frustratingand since we were only there for 3 days. it felt like we spent a fullday just trying to get to the hotel. Also. if you needed anything youhad to call a real estate agent and always had to leave a message. Youcould not reach anyone and they never returned your call.,I liked that the property was on the harbor. water taxis wereconvenient. rooms were nice.
Evolve East Boston,Boss,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 30  2016,4.6,The customer service was terrible. The TV didn't work. We didn't have enough towels for our party of 4. There was only one bed for 4 people. We called the phone # to talk to Erica only to find the mailbox full. The experience was so bad that we're seeking a refund through our credit card company.,Location and cleanliness of the room.
Evolve East Boston,Adam,United States of America,1 review,August 15  2016,9.6,No curtains in the room. had blinds. but the sun poured right in and I couldn't sleep past sunrise at all.,Loved the location.

Evolve East Boston,Liliana,United States of America,5 Reviews,August 12  2016,4.2,For us was an experience very negative.We arrived in the apartment and. despite we payed for 3 people. we had a double bed and a sofa but without any sheet or towel for the third person. The people at the reception was not helpful at all so for us was a big problem. We used a beach towel instead of sheets!The day after. despite we requested before booking to stay 2 hours after official checkout (11am) they called us at 11am in a very rude way to go away immediately. giving us only 15 minutes after 11pm to left the apartment. Because it was Saturday there was no possibilities to talk with the owner or a director. There was an employer. Ceryl. that was extremely rude and aggressive that talked with us. The day after I wrote to the director explaining what's happened and I hadn't any response. Nobody apologized for the situation.For us was an extremely bad experience. I don't recommend this hotel to anyone.,The only thing I really like is the location
Evolve East Boston,Bente,Belgium,5 Reviews,July 29  2016,9.6,We needed some light in the living room part of the apartment. Not enough light to read or to look at maps. Also only light at one side of the bed.A bit more equipment in the beautiful kitchen would have been nice.Be aware that not all apartments have a dining table (but a huge sofa area).,Excellent location. New building. new area. Quiet. Next to the river with view to Boston. Maverick metro just 50 m away. and with one stop you are either in Boston center or at the airport.Helpful concierge. Possibility of using the clubroom; we stayed there for two hours after having checked out. and before we left for the airport.
Evolve East Boston,Peter,United States of America,1 review,July 17  2016,6.7,Could not get into building.  Local tenant let us into lobby.  Waited 40 minutes for concierge to arrive back from break.  We were not on the guest list.,Close to airport - nice Italian restaurant close by.

Evolve East Boston,Spyridon,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 23  2016,2.5,I don’t understand how this property has been rated at an average of 8. Most of the reviews must be fake. there’s no other explanation.It was impossible to communicate with the people operating or owning this apartment. There was only a fridge magnet (see the picture) that had some basic information and no one ever answered the phones!1.	Location: The building is located in East Boston in the projects. An area that is not safe. When we left this apartment the concierge was not a concierge. but a security guard. And the reason why they need a security guard is because IT IS NOT A SAFE AREA!2.	Location: This place is supposedly close to downtown Boston. It couldn’t be farther from the truth. If you don’t have a car the apartment is not convenient.3.	Apartment: There is no information in booking.com that the apartments are all studios. It’s relatively ok. if you’re looking to book an apartment for 2 people. but it’s not good for 4 people. I would have never booked the apartment if I knew beforehand that this was a studio. The ownership/management is chaotic and you don't know who to address any issues. When you call or email everyone no one ever responds.4.	Apartment: 2 people can sleep on the bed and 2 people can sleep on the sofa. which has a ruined very thin mattress.5.	Apartment: There weren’t any covers. or pillows. or sheets for the people that were sleeping on the sofa. So we ended up freezing through the night. I returned home with a cold!6.	Apartment: There weren’t enough towels for 4 people. Only 3 bath towels!!! No hand towels either. only 2!!!7.	Apartment: There was some kind of party in the building on the ground floor where the apartment was located so we stayed up most of the night. And as if that was not adequate they started vacuuming at 6am in the morning outside of the apartment. which of course sounded as if they were vacuuming inside the apartment.8.,There was nothing that I liked in this stay.
Evolve East Boston,Pamelia,United States of America,1 review,May 9  2016,8.8,They did not check my ID upon picking up the keys. I was not given instructions on what to do to make sure I was not charged extra upon leaving. No extra trash bags and a partial small bottle of dishwasher liquid was available. A few pods for the washing machine would have been a plus!,It's was very clean and very comfortable with all the amenities we needed.
Evolve East Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,April 27  2016,5.0,We asked to check in early but there was a $75 check-in early fee. which was ridiculous. so we checked in at normal time but even then our place was not ready. We had to wait 30 minutes for them to "clean" and it was not clean when we finally got in. The trash hadn't been taken out. the dust was awful. and the towels had a mysterious stain...The bed is hard as a rock. and honestly the location is deceiving from the description. Expect to pay a bunch in taxi fees if you want to go anywhere in Boston.,The front desk lady was very helpful to call us cabs and nice.
Evolve East Boston,Aleksandra,United States of America,8 Reviews,April 25  2016,7.1,I needed an early check-in and a late check-out. because one of my friends got sick and could not go sightseeing. just needed to stay in the apartment. Unfortunately. I could not contact the owner through booking.com and the concierge wasn't helpful either. The late check-out request wasn't processed through booking.com. but the owner still charged additional $75 after because my friend just stayed in the apartment anyway. Very poor communication! Could have been much easier if the owner's contact number was provided. But the property is fine otherwise.,The location is perfect. only one subway stop from the center of Boston and with a great view of Boston skyline
Evolve East Boston,Guanrong,China,11 Reviews,April 10  2016,7.5,Service was TERRIBLE. if there WAS any. We waited in the lobby for at least 30 minutes for check in. and the receptionist has no idea what was going on at all.,location is amazing
Evolve East Boston,Anonymous,Canada,45 Reviews,April 7  2016,7.9,The receptionist at arrival was not really professional : couldn't find our booking reservation. had no idea we had asked for a parking place. we had to show we had prepaid for it and to ask her 3 times for the explains on where it was and how it works.As it is not a hotel but a flats renting agency you have to deal with. once you get there you are on your own ! They should explain a little better simple things you need to know at first like how to get to your flat from the back door. how to handle the parking fence's openning or where to leave your garbage (a little map of the building would be great).I think that the main disappointment came from the fact there was absolutely no table nor desk in the appartment ! To write on your knees is already not the very best but to eat on your knees too is a bit ridiculous. The kitchen is equipped with a wonderful range and oven we hardly used : how to cut a steak or bring a casserole for diner if you have no table ? while there was room for a little desk in the main room and for a table and 2 chairs in the kitchen area. even folding ones would have been a strict necessity.None of the bathroom basics you can find in simple cheap motels (hair dryer. soap. shampoo etc) were provided in this luxury flat. It would have been also nice to find a little starter kit in the kitchen (salt. pepper. oil. sugar. tea etc).Especially missing there were some tea towels and dish soap as you cannot expect people travelling with their own dishwasher pads nor buy a full box for the use of 2. do you ? - as a result. that was an other great appliance we could not use !The vacuum cleaner was not working well (missing a piece).,Stylish spacious room. plenty of drawers. extra clean appartment (but for the windows that could have been far cleaner).  very comfortable bedding. a change provided for the sheets and bathroom towels. brand new appliances. a nice brewing coffee machine (with 2 capsules provided. hurray !).They sent us ahead the coordonates to put in the GPS in case this one couldn't find the address as the whole area is in construction. new nice condos replacing the old steamers harbor.The building is on the bay. so facing the whole Boston skyline with a direct view on Bunker Hill.It's quiet enough for the airport traffic to go on without annoyance.The T station (Maverick) is just a 2 minutes scenic walk through a public lawn so the very heart of historic Boston is only 2 stops away.If you keep walking 2 minutes more after passing the T station you reach the central square of a busy but safe latino community with a bus station. lots of little general stores and a wonderful (Colombian !) bakery-eatery.To have a secure parking place in Boston (even at 10 US$/day extra) is a real plus.There is no-check out so you can leave at an early hour if needed. The only thing is to leave your keys on the kitchen counter and send a picture of it as a proof. Now after doing so we asked for a confirmation that all was ok but 2 weeks later nothing came yet - I agree with an other comment that says that long term residents there are probably more "on the management's radar". But we had the good surprise to find that Booking.com had actually charged us less than what was the approximate price at booking time due to their lowest price guarantee. Thank you.
Evolve East Boston,Pat,Ireland,36 Reviews,April 5  2016,3.3,They advertise 24/7 concierge. I received an email 4 days before arrival wanting to know when I was arriving. My flight was arriving late into Boston so I replied to the email to say it would be between 12pm and 1am in the morning when I would arrive. I arrived at 12:15am to discovery there was no one at reception. After 15 mins a young lady appeared. She informed me that she was just finishing work and that no one would be available to book me in. She was very ill mannered but eventually rang an individual called Tyrone who told me their was no 24/7 concierge available. I asked about my email but he shrugged off the question. Eventually I was given access to a room. If I had been 5 minutes later I would have been on the street for the night.Apart from that the following also is relevant.Half a roll of toilet paper for 2 people for 3 days stayNo hair dryer availableNo dishwasher powder or a small amount of washing powder for the washing machine.TV did not work for half a day because the subscription was not paidAnd to crown it all you have to take your rubbish with you when you leave. I have traveled all over the world stayed in hostels to 5 star hotels and I never had to take my rubbish from my room,Good view from Apartment

Evolve East Boston,Shurao,United States of America,3 Reviews,March 21  2016,5.8,We purchased the parking for 5 days. But our car still got towed. No one ever contacted us about our car. When we found out. it was the third day that it got towed so we had to pay 160 dollars for the towing company. We called the managers to understand what is going on and tried to get our money back. But all they did was keeping saying that they would contact us once they have any updates. But they never contacted us. I sent them emails but they never answered that either. The room was run by the portside apartment and also Northeast Suites which makes it super confusing and chaotic. Both of them just kept pushing their responsibility and tried to blame us.,The room was fairly clean

Evolve East Boston,Zhensu,China,7 Reviews,February 16  2016,8.8,The room could be lighter. They only have lamps in the bedrooms and living room. Also. agree with other travelers on the addition of curtains. which would improve privacy.,Very good location: right close to the blue line Maverick station and near the airport.A great 1B1B studio with pretty much all equipment you need
Evolve East Boston,Rocky,Canada,1 review,January 20  2016,10,If I had to choose 1 think I didn't like it would be that there was no curtains on the windows. There were blinds but it would be nice to have that extra privacy with curtains,The property was amazing. The room was excellent. Very clean. quiet and the front desk concierge was very friendly and helpful. The subway system was a 1 min walk from the property and was very easy to navigate thanks to the help of the front desk concierge.the view from our room was amazing as well.

One-Bedroom on Beacon Street Apt 206,John,United States of America,1 review,April 23  2017,7.1,OK.  Overall we were very happy with the place but a few things need attention:  The temperature control in the tub would change on its own.  Think of it as a clock.  It started out at 5 o'clock and got to be warm when you moved it CCW to 10 o'clock.  But when you took your hand off the handle. the weight of the handle would move it down to 9 or 8 o'clock where the water got extremely hot!  I had to hold the handle throughout my showers to keep from getting scalded.  Also the fan in the bathroom did not work and the hot water steamed up the room with no way to get the humidity out of the apt.  Several of the TV stations available were not viewable.  The screen pixilated.  My guess is that the apt had low signal strength.  A simple call out to the cable supplier and adding an amplifier to the system would work wonders.  Also could some dish towels be added to the deal.  We didn't bring our own and had to either drip dry all the dishes or dry them with paper towels.  Lastly the directions to enter the apartment building could have been a lot clearer.,The location was excellent!  Near the train station. only four blocks from Fenway Park.  Awesome parking. free and right on the street in front of the apt!  Excellent views!

The Farrington Inn,Rhonda,United States of America,2 Reviews,November 1  2017,6.3,The bed was terrible table and chair was broke. They brought in a new table and chair but the legs on the chair were very weak. No cable,The device when needed
The Farrington Inn,Jeremy,United Kingdom,1 review,November 1  2017,3.8,Cleanliness was very poor. The bed was extremely uncomfortable. Noise from adjacent rooms unacceptable. Overall a very un pleasant experience,Very little
The Farrington Inn,Rasheeda,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 27  2017,8.8,N/A,The location was great. It only had on Tv and that was in living room the beds made a lot of noise and it was a little cold in or room. Overall for a over night stay it was okay.
The Farrington Inn,Anonymous,Germany,53 Reviews,October 25  2017,5.0,Everything is very very old. Some furniture was broken. You can perfectly hear your neighbours and noises from the street. Too far from citycenter if going on foot.,But bed linen. towel and shared bathroom were clean.
The Farrington Inn,Emily,United States of America,1 review,October 21  2017,3.3,The place is just above a dive. broken tiles. ripped furniture. not cleaned well (watch for used condoms!). and very noisy from other guests. Spend the extra to enjoy Boston.,The location is close to the metro and restaurants.
The Farrington Inn,Anonymous,Canada,1 review,October 21  2017,4.6,The room is small with no bathroom. noisy bed and cheap mattress but clean2 small windows with no natural light coming in. very old furnitures and everything elseits ok for travel in solo. just a place to sleep. money wise? not sure about that!! do your research,Small kitchen in the room (#128) overall the place its clean but need serious update and renovations.the parking is in the back.not a lot of space thought.the check in was fast and friendly. haven't see other staff in the hotel.Not far from the green line public transport the T on Commonwealth ave. brings you to downtown
The Farrington Inn,Kimberley,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 20  2017,7.9,Property would benefit from a good spring clean. Shared bathroom door handle felt like it was going to come off in my hand every time I used it,Staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was cozy and you could get in and please yourself. Quiet location. Very close to local shops and public transport
The Farrington Inn,Nikola,United States of America,1 review,October 19  2017,5.0,That everything on the website looks at least hundred times better than in person also that they have another building and that bathroom is for all the people in the building.,The people who are working in Farrington Inn are very nice and helpful.
The Farrington Inn,Laia,Spain,10 Reviews,October 19  2017,6.3,The room that we got wasn't the same that they are showing in the pics. We got just two beds. few drawers and a been. Also our rooms was in another​ building near by. The furniture and the room is very old and quite smelly in the shared areas.,If you are going to Boston and you want a place just for sleep it's great. The bathroom was really clean every day.
The Farrington Inn,Marta,Portugal,25 Reviews,October 19  2017,6.7,There is no excuse for having so much dirt everywhere. The hallways are filthy. nothing that a vaccum cleaner cannot solve. they have to buildings. each with 2 separate entrances. I strongly recommend they close 1 at a time to do rennovations and deep cleaning.,The staff was really nice and attentive. It's close to the T and the streets around are full of restaurants and bars. The Inn can be much more than it is. it's a beautiful building (from the outside). the room was ok. but needs a lot of work.
The Farrington Inn,Vasile,United States of America,1 review,October 16  2017,7.9,The building itself needs to be renovated: corridor carpets. doors. sills. and other wear areas  need to be refurbished.,There was a/c. strong water pressure. and I got an upgrade to a private bathroom on my birthday just by coincidence. The style of the buildings is very nice. 19th/20th century.
The Farrington Inn,Heidbra,Denmark,3 Reviews,October 13  2017,7.1,N/A,Nice budget hotel near public transport just 15 minutes from center of Boston.Wifi. Aircondition and room were fine.Surroundings were clean. The neigbourhood was full of young people. restaurants. cafés.
The Farrington Inn,Laurence,Canada,1 review,October 13  2017,8.8,The walls were really thin. so the people in the other appartements must have heard us talking. as we heard them too,The place was cute. we almost felt like home instantly
The Farrington Inn,Franklin,United States of America,1 review,October 12  2017,9.2,It would be grossly unfair to complain about anything at this level of value-for-price. Some reviewers complained about cleanliness below their standard. but I didn't notice anything objectionable. A traveler should be comfortable. but vigilant and resilient. n'est-ce pas?,Home-y! Comfortable. not fancy. Location excellent. close to T. near appealing restaurants. Off-street parking a real plus. A sweet hit of nostalgia. as I was a student living in the area 40 years ago.
The Farrington Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 9  2017,7.9,They were fairly clean but shared bathrooms are always iffy and half the lights in our room were out.,We stayed for a concert and it was only a 5 minute walk to the show and there were tons of options for food in walking distance. The staff went above and beyond as well. We stayed one night but had a show the next night too so they let us leave our car and it was raining out so they gave an extra umbrella they had to a couple about to go out!
The Farrington Inn,Lilly,United States of America,1 review,October 8  2017,2.9,Old. old.  old property with no updates at all. Very very dirty. mold everywhere. When you enter the building you smell the mold already. Inside the property it's very old. with a ripped sofa. rugs that must be there for decades. dirty and mold on the windows. floor. bathroom. bedrooms. etc. I was supposed to stay 3 nights. stayed just one. was miserable with allergies next morning and asked to check out early. The one thing that was good is that the owner gave me my money back without any problems.,Nothing
The Farrington Inn,Janet,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 8  2017,3.8,the bath and bed were clean but otherwise . not. carpets were in need of vacuuming the tiles in the bath were all cracked and broken . It was noisy and there was never anyone at the front desk,not much.
The Farrington Inn,Anonymous,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 8  2017,4.6,There had been a rodent in my room (clear evidence packaged food had been nibbled into). but the staff were friendly - they laid down traps. refunded that night. and offered to move me elsewhere.,The staff were nice. and location was decent.
The Farrington Inn,Pauline,Canada,6 Reviews,October 5  2017,6.3,Could use sprucing up. a bit antiquated.,Staff were very helpful with a situation that arose with travel needs.I checked in very late and they were understanding.Nice that the inn is within walking distance of train.
The Farrington Inn,Anonymous,Venezuela,4 Reviews,September 28  2017,4.6,The rooms are not at all as shown in the pictures. also there's no clarification that one might end up in a different building than the one that appears on the website. Overall the place was dusty and the bathrooms not clean. I found small roaches every time I entered it and at some point I even found some in my room.Also it'd be great to clarify in the website when a place doesn't have an elevator. I'd probably wouldn't have chosen it since I knew I was going to have very heavy luggage. so when I left I had to carry them myself through 2 flights of stairs.I don't mind staying in places like this (although probably for less money). the problem is when the information on the website sells you something very different than what it really is.,The staff was very nice and helpful!
The Farrington Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 27  2017,2.9,The worst hotel I have ever visited. The room had stains AND was really dirty. IT smelled like if twenty people were smoking there when we walked in. The bed looked horrible and instead of a matress it had air matress. The windows. walls. rug and everything was really dirty. We stayed for like 10 minutes in absolute shock. The we went down to get our Money back and he didnt protest because he knew it was bad. It was 113$ For this nightmare and as soon as we got out of there we booked a beautiful hotel with two kingsized beds for 145$....we were so happy we left that smelly horrible place. I DO NOT reccomend this place at all.,Nothing....
The Farrington Inn,Anonymous,Czech Republic,4 Reviews,September 25  2017,4.2,The bathroom on the floor was for four rooms. It was often occupied. Water stream was weak. There is no elevator. we had to bring our heavy luggage to the third floor. Overall the property is too expensive for the quality of service provided.,N/A
The Farrington Inn,Kathryn,United States of America,1 review,September 25  2017,8.3,I did not mind sharing a bathroom but it could have been slightly cleaner and just more welcoming. Having towels in the bathroom would be nice or lotion or just some sort of decor. Also. I was traveling alone and I'm young but there was definitely noise throughout the night due to the nightlife with the college students. The blinds were the only noticeable thing in the room. They were falling apart and I think that would improve the overall look of the room.,I needed assistance getting to the property and not only did someone help me over the phone but he came to the door to make sure I pulled into the right lot. I appreciated a safe place to park and that it was free.  Also. I was cold and someone brought me a space heater to my room at no charge. Everyone I spoke to was very friendly and accommodating. I thought this was an adorable inn and the service meant more to me than anything else!
The Farrington Inn,偉凌,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 25  2017,5.8,This place is mostly wooden and old. It was hot and humid in the rooms. The bed sheets were fairly clean. but there was some dust on the cover sheet. The bed makes sounds when we move. and it is a bit sunken in the middle. so wasn't that comfortable. The bathroom is shared. so no one will clean up after every tenant. It was clean when we used it.,My friend and I crushed over after a concert and left early in the morning. It's a nice place for such situation but not a place for vacation. We were there around 11:45 pm. and the staff wasn't at the table. but a phone is at the front door to call him. so the check-in was fine. The staff was nice to us.
The Farrington Inn,Naomi,United States of America,9 Reviews,September 24  2017,3.8,Considering how the owner of this property wants the rates to match those of Boston inner city (a sluggish 45 min trolly ride from this property) the rooms should most definitely be worth the price  theyre asking. The worst beds by far. Probably havent been replaced in over 15 years.I wouldnt be surprised if they were used to begin with. Painful sleep. if any sleep at all. Hard springs practically jutting into your body. The bathroom/room on the top floor was something out of a creepy 1970's outdated apt. And dirty! Stains ALL over the place including the wall next to your head while youre laying down. P.s. and they dont provide soap. Is there a cleaning staff employed here?,Close to the T station
The Farrington Inn,David,United States of America,1 review,September 16  2017,5.4,The common areas of the building are long past their prime. There is no space between the toilet and the vanity. The shower was not clean. The blinds are broken and the drapes tattered.,The bed was comfortable

I also liked the mouse or rat helping me eat my bread !!!!!
The Farrington Inn,Tewodros,Ethiopia,5 Reviews,September 11  2017,2.5,One my worst experience and still feel a night mare at this old grave looking place. A very old and ruined out house turned to an inn where rooms are extremely dirty. location is off the center in residential area. people at the property are arrogant and never been there if in case you face problems and get a worn out bed. No ckeaning service to your room if you stay there longer. You share washroom with everyone in that floor and sometimes you quie waiting for the person there.Do not waste your money. time and resources trying to stay in this place which should not in the first place be listed as safe property for people traveling to Boston. the wonderful city.,Nothing
The Farrington Inn,Vincie,United States of America,1 review,September 11  2017,6.3,Just a really WEIRD set up.  Beds very uncomfortable and the two pillows on each bed were nearly flat and VERY uncomfortable.  Also. the TV was in a very weird position - couldn't see it from lying in bed.  Suggest they corner it on the wall towards the beds.  Also suggest some NEW bedding... the look of it was just old and very dark/dreary,The person that showed us to the room was very friendly.  The place itself was very close to everything we needed.
The Farrington Inn,Anonymous,France,2 Reviews,September 7  2017,7.5,Be prepared to share bathrooms and for some old furnishings,Given all hotels in Boston seem expensive. the Farrington Inn represents good value for money. Well located for public transport into the city. very friendly and helpful staff. clean. comfortable rooms.
The Farrington Inn,Traveller,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,September 5  2017,3.3,The walls are not soundproof at all! I had a couple living next door and I heard EVERY SINGLE WORD they said to each other. The fact that they had arguments two nights in a row made me awake till 2am in the morning! Seriously. paying over 100 dollars per night. one deserves some basic sleep!!! No offence to the staff. but I would NEVER go back to this place. let alone recommending it to others.,The size of the room is fine. The location is okay if you stick to the south bank of the river. but going to the north (e.g. Harvard and MIT) is not easy via subway.
The Farrington Inn,Agnieszka,France,4 Reviews,September 4  2017,5.4,Very old building we stayed in. It's fair to say beds were nice and clean. no issue there. bathroom clean too. However the rest of the apartment looked like it's falling apart and most of all like it has never been cleaned properly. (Kitchenette. sitting area. sofas. blinders...). We basically did not want to touch most of these. Just sleep this one night and go. I would have never picked it to stay with kids if new in advance.  We decided to move to a different hotel for the second night.,Nice helpful staff. Really good places to eat in close proximity.
The Farrington Inn,Disgusted!!!!,United States of America,1 review,September 2  2017,2.5,Bed bugs!!!! Disgusting room!! I had an infection in my leg and arm had to go to the doctor to take antibiotics and medication for the rest of my stay. Had to change rooms twice! Went and bought cleaning supplies and cleaned the place so we could stay in that place!!!!,Absolutely nothing!
The Farrington Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 30  2017,8.3,A bit far from downtown for our needs.,Front desk service was excellent. He was able to bring us extra pillows and towels. provide restaurant recommendations and receive an off-hours call about our key. This is a bare-bones inn where you'll need to bring your own shampoo and soap. but it's a great value (with valuable off-street parking available) in an expensive city.
The Farrington Inn,David,United States of America,1 review,August 27  2017,5.8,The room smelled quite bad. there was a lot of dust everywhere and the whole place felt a bit dirty and not well maintained. You can likely find much nicer place for the same price.  we chose this one mainly because of the free parking a quite good location.,Free parking and quite close to Harvard. MIT and the city center. The location and free parking were great.
The Farrington Inn,Veronica,United States of America,1 review,August 19  2017,9.2,Could of had some more amenities in the shared bathrooms (hand towels. soaps/lotions. etc.),Great little suite with a living room/kitchen area.  Super quaint and cozy.  Staff went above and beyond to meet our requests.
The Farrington Inn,Joshua,Kenya,2 Reviews,August 15  2017,3.3,Rooms are not what you see on the internet. Need some painting. They should put it clear that bathroom is shared between several rooms.have some breakfast at least,Nothing
The Farrington Inn,Samantha,United States of America,1 review,August 14  2017,8.3,The only real complaint I have is the door to the bathroom. When people are not careful to lead the door closed. it slams and is extremely loud and disruptive at night.,I liked how the staff was - I don't remember his name. but he was very accomodating and was not a stickler for the rules (ie: the exact license plate. he didn't need me to go get the last few digits. just asked for the make of the car). I VERY much appreciated the free parking. That was the biggest selling point of this location and made my stay 100% better because I had a place to keep my car while I travelled into the city. The location is also very good because right around on Brighton is a lively. foodie street.
The Farrington Inn,Jordan,United States of America,1 review,August 10  2017,8.3,N/A,We booked a room with one bed. but they gave us a room with two. Not sure if it was an upgrade or not. but it was awesome. It's certainly not a 5 star hotel. but it is accommodating and a place to rest your head. The staff was very helpful.
The Farrington Inn,Steve,United States of America,1 review,August 10  2017,5.4,It's fine if you just need a bed for a night travelling alone. Very poor grade of mattress. Place is clean &amp; safe. but very worn with a must oder.  Shared bath.  Some vandelism in the bathroom during the night causing toilet flood.  Young children of someone visiting the US made a real racket during the evening.  Reminded me of my old fraternity house from back in my college days. Price is just too high for what you get.  For just a little more. next time we'll use a regular hotel.,Friendly staff. good location. Close to medical. walk to BU. walk to Commonwealth Ave "T".  Reasonably close to MIT. Harvard &amp; BC.
The Farrington Inn,Courtney,United States of America,1 review,August 4  2017,7.9,N/A,My flight was delayed and I didn't get to the property until 2:00 am. but the manager stayed and waited for me and checked me in. even though check-in time ended on midnight.  For that reason alone. I give this place a big thumbs up!
The Farrington Inn,Phillip,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,July 30  2017,3.8,The fact i saw a junkie OD in the main hallway and had to wait while emergency services arrive.Or the fact someone was knocking on my door at 4am for about 20mins Ted with me yelling at them to go away,N/A
The Farrington Inn,George,United States of America,1 review,July 28  2017,4.2,No hand towels. dishes in cupboard were dirty. bedspread was filthy with cigg burns in them.  Lamp and the fake flowers were very scary.  Hole in the bathroom ceiling was interesting. Beds were very hard and creaky.  Glad I was there for only one night.  Sorry but would not go back again.,Location and parking.
The Farrington Inn,Casey,United States of America,1 review,July 25  2017,6.3,I didn't like the noisy neighbors who had the cops called on them. I didn't like the uncomfortable bed and I was very nervous to sleep under the covers seeing how the rest of the place wasn't that clean.,I liked that we were close enough to walk to Fenway Park. I liked that they had off street parking that we didnt have to pay extra for. I liked that it wasn't expensive to stay there and I liked that the room had an air conditioner.
The Farrington Inn,Jannera,United States of America,1 review,July 24  2017,8.8,They did not provide any towels or toiletries like most hotels. They bathroom was a shared bathroom with the rest of the floor.,The front desk personnel was very friendly and helped us park on the right side of the parking lot even we arrived to the location after midnight. I appreciated his availability and willingness to help even though it was very late!
The Farrington Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 20  2017,5.0,Very dated property (old) and a bit dirty. Carpets needed a vacuum. Boston accommodation is ultimately very expensive. This was the cheapest I could find for 1 night which was fine but still very basic.,Quiet and in a fairly convenient location. 20 min walk to Harvard Square and a short walk to the T which takes you downtown.
The Farrington Inn,Marie,France,5 Reviews,July 20  2017,4.2,Wifi doesn't reach the bedroom. Filthy floors and stairs carpets. Bed mattresses squeaking at the slightest move.One dirty. tiny bathroom for 6 bedrooms ! I get it : if you want cheap accommodation. don't expect much comfort. But shabby could be simple and charming. not necessarily filthy and crumbling ! For example :Repair the broken window store... instead of hanging ugly. flowery. frilly useless drape curtains hiding no light at all!Clean the grime in the doorframe and dirty paintwork. instead of hanging unnecessary picture frames and placing fake flowers in a vase!And since you have water pipes in the bedroom. a shower cabin will be more useful than a kitchenette!,Large bedroom.Parking spaces for guests.The "reception" attendant kindly carried our luggage up the narrow stairs to the second floor of the next building.
The Farrington Inn,Tiffers,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 17  2017,8.8,The view was someone's backyard. There were creepy paintings on the walls. The proximity to the street was very near and the amount of noise we could hear from outside was a lot. We could hear a lot from the people above us.,We payed next to nothing for our room. knowing very well that we might be getting ourselves into something subpar and not caring because we needed to save some money. We prayed that there just wouldn't be any bed bugs. Our expectations were surpassed 10.000%. We were brought to a room that was supposed to only be a double bed with a shared bathroom but instead was a huge suite with a living room. full kitchen. three closets. a bathroom to ourselves. and two bedrooms with 4 total sleeping spots. I don't know if this was some kind of fluke or something but we were blessed to have that room! We checked for bed bugs: none present! This was an incredible travel experience and we never would have come across this hotel if it weren't for booking.com.
The Farrington Inn,Jessica,United States of America,1 review,July 15  2017,8.3,We had no complaints. You should be aware that the furniture feels like a college bachelor pad but overall was clean.,We were upgraded to an entire apt when we arrived...the intuitive staff member who checked us in really made our time there much more pleasant.
The Farrington Inn,Collin,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 14  2017,5.8,It is a 1-star hotel.  You have to share a bathroom with 5 or 6 other rooms from your floor.  But. for what it's worth. I never had to wait for a bathroom.  The room itself was kind of quaint.  The TV did not work properly and a good portion of the electrical outlets in the room were so old my chargers would not stay plugged in.  The room was clean. the bathroom was okay but the other common areas were pretty dirty.  The inn is not very accessible (you must climb stairs) so if anyone in your party is disabled I recommend you call ahead and make sure they can accommodate you.,The three redeeming qualities of this place are its price. its location and free parking.  It is the cheapest place you are going to find near Boston.  It is a 5-10 minute walk to the nearest T stop and from there it's a 20-30 minute ride to downtown Boston.  If you are willing to stay here and ride the T (or even use Uber or Lyft) you can avoid driving in downtown Boston traffic and save upwards of $200 per night.  These qualities were good enough for me.
The Farrington Inn,Edward,United States of America,1 review,July 14  2017,8.8,I was apprehensive about parking.  The lot was very full. and I think that it would be a serious problem if it actually filled up before I got back.,Good value (very inexpensive).  On-site parking (but difficult).  Convenient location when traveling from the west.
The Farrington Inn,Johan,Sweden,3 Reviews,July 14  2017,5.4,Pris kontra standard.,If you think of a place which is a mix between Bates Motel (from the Hitchcock film) and a Seinfeld flat. in desperate need of maintenance. you are still not getting close. However. fridge. shower. TV and AC worked fine.Beds were creaking but no sign of roaches and if you want to experience a flat with early 1900s charm for a place to sleep. then go för ut. Would I stay there again? I would object to the price. For just twice that money we stayed at Stewart Hotel on Manhattan with walking distance to Times square.
The Farrington Inn,Janelda,United States of America,1 review,July 14  2017,7.5,It wasn't the building featured in the ad which took us by surprise.,The size was impressive.  However neighbors were quite noisy into the night.  There were nice places to eat nearby.
The Farrington Inn,Jeanice,United States of America,1 review,July 12  2017,8.3,N/A,Its very old fashion. but thats what I like the most. It was comfy and quiet the staff was very friendly and helpful and they made  my partner and I (we are lesbians) feel welcomed. Its just like renting a room with a shared bathrroom. I loved by car was only 12 mins from downtown Boston.   we're there so many beautiful fun historical things to see. due and learn. My partner and I had a awesome time..
The Farrington Inn,Seth,United States of America,1 review,July 10  2017,10,Taking the bus from the airport takes quite awhile especially during rush hour. and the only way to the second and third floors is by stairs,Cheap and clean. felt very comfortable
The Farrington Inn,Hoped,Canada,4 Reviews,June 29  2017,4.2,Shower was quite dirty. had to shower with flip flops on as the appearance of the shower was questionable. there was a dirt mark in the upper corner of the edge of the bathtub that was cleaned away when  wiped with cloth &amp; water. certainly was not cleaned properly.,Bed was comfortable. Owner was very friendly &amp; was helpful.
The Farrington Inn,William,United States of America,1 review,June 27  2017,8.3,It's hard to find anything not to like about this place. It unique and different from normal hotel stay. If you're used to regular fancy hotels or even like days inn this place isn't for you. But if you want something fun and different and very wonderful helpful polite amazing staff and unique little room. Farrington inn is where you need to go! Only thing that was objective to me. Was it was a little bit over priced for what you get. but its location is the cheapest of anything I could find close to downtown and the attractions.,The staff was so friendly the location to where we needed to be was perfect. everyone there and working there was so amazing and helpful and very nice. We were worried about the bathroom sharing but it was great we never had to wait on the bathroom one time. This place was so cozy and people so friendly. And a different hotel stay experience. So I recommend this to anyone the wants to try something neat and different.
The Farrington Inn,Anonymous,Switzerland,11 Reviews,June 25  2017,7.1,The bed was maybe not the most comfortable one.,Upper shared bathroom with views outside views. Very convenient location with public transportation and close to Harvard.
The Farrington Inn,Zadina,United States of America,4 Reviews,June 24  2017,7.1,Didnt like the tight parking although we did find a space at night.,I liked the sink being in the room to wash dishes and the customer servive my first night there. After my first night. there was a guest room staff who wasnt as nice though.
The Farrington Inn,Dawn,United States of America,1 review,June 22  2017,5.4,The fact that we had to share a bathroom with other guest and they were not cleaned daily was grouse.  There were no paper towels. hand towels or bathmats.,N/A
The Farrington Inn,Flemming,Netherlands,5 Reviews,June 22  2017,6.7,Fire extinguisher missing. No markings of emergency exits. Property not well secured. i.e. having unlocked doors on 1st floor balcony.,It's like being a student again. sharing an old flat with worn mis-matched second hand furniture.
The Farrington Inn,Brian,United States of America,1 review,June 21  2017,10,N/A,The owner was fantastic. He went above and beyond to accommodate my romantic day with my girl. He put rose petals on the bed. he directed me to a great florist. Top notch guy.
The Farrington Inn,Danielle,United States of America,1 review,June 19  2017,7.9,It would've been great if there were some complementary coffee in the lobby. the rugs are old and need to be cleaned.,Staff was warm and friendly. very helpful in assisting with directions to different locations around Boston
The Farrington Inn,Todd,United States of America,1 review,June 18  2017,3.8,The bathroom was down the hall (community ). Room was outdated. price was way too high for no bathroom,Easy check in clerk was helpful in carrying my bag
The Farrington Inn,Ivana,Czech Republic,2 Reviews,June 18  2017,6.3,It is old house. The windows were not open. There was only air conditioning. There was little bit smell.,Clean room and bathroom in quiet neighborhood near to Harvard. Perfect personal. they advised me everything.
The Farrington Inn,Vera,Netherlands,1 review,June 17  2017,2.5,The place was old and dirty. The building is not well maintained. nor clean. Our room smelled bad. the bed was horrible and the matras had filty stains. The window did not open. The bathroom  was shared. which is ok if cleaned  frequently. We stayed 3 nights. the bathroom was sort of cleaned once. You pay way to much for this  place. DO NOT STAY HERE!,Location was good. Great breakfast diner a block away.
The Farrington Inn,Jacobo,United States of America,1 review,June 16  2017,4.6,Small bedroom. kinda creepy property. weird spicy smell all over the place. It was the cheapest bedroom I could find for a couple of days in Boston but $100 for a night there was way expensive considered what I found when I arrived.I think a preternatural evil was locked down in the property so I will recommend to the visitors to pack some garlic. salt and holly water. maybe silver bullets and a copy of the De Vermis Mysteriis.  Any precaution will be worth it.,A lot of korean restaurants in the neighbourhood (I imagine that's why I didn't see any dogs around)
The Farrington Inn,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,June 13  2017,7.5,Rather dated - many of the outlets didn't work properly and finding a plug that worked well enough to charge our electronics was a bit of a struggle. There is a shared bathroom. for each floor - not too much of a hassle as long as you remember to ask for towels from the staff before you need to shower in the middle of the night.,The Farrington inn is a quaint little location. It was clean and we'll kept. A very short walk from a T station. one of the best breakfast joints I've ever been to - the Allston diner. as well as several other little shops and establishments. As far as location we didn't find ourselves wanting for anything.
The Farrington Inn,Nina,Australia,1 review,June 12  2017,7.5,Room had a musty smell though in such an old building perhaps to be expected. Patchy wifi.,Value for money and very friendly staff. Clean room although shared bathrooms were hit and miss. Good location.
The Farrington Inn,Eric,United States of America,3 Reviews,June 10  2017,6.3,We were lodged away from the Farrington house. Large apartment. no heater. no coffee. breakfast or anything else. The attendant told us "you paid to spend the night. that's what you get",Parking spot available in a very busy street with NO space no
The Farrington Inn,Jayavantha,India,5 Reviews,June 10  2017,3.3,The facility was very poor. Stinking place. The room was not cleaned even once in all 3 days I was there.  Very old place with zero maintenance. The staff made me wait for an hour to get a taxi although they promised to arrange in 3 minutes.,Nothing except for the location
The Farrington Inn,Sarah,Canada,1 review,June 9  2017,5.8,The shower was slimy and the blinds were stained and broken.,The television. microwave. an mini-fridge in the room were unexpected perks. The room was a good size for one person.
The Farrington Inn,Halfpennybuddha,Sweden,11 Reviews,June 8  2017,9.2,It was a bit far from downtown. but that was only annoying because public transportation in Boston is rubbish (which isn't the inn's fault).,The staff were super friendly. and it was great value for money. clean. and unique. It wasn't super new and smooth. but that gave it a little bit of charm and character and didn't deter from our stay.
The Farrington Inn,Kevin,Ireland,4 Reviews,June 8  2017,4.6,Needs to be modernised painted and cleaned badly. Shared bathroom dirty &amp; toilet blocked for 2 days. This is a hostel not a hotel or Inn.,Nice staff
The Farrington Inn,Anton,Russia,12 Reviews,June 4  2017,3.8,Everything isnt like it has to be at all.Broken things. a lot of the dust everywhere. you can hear your neighboors. You have only one thing on your mind - to get away from here early morning and return late evening so tired not to pay attention to anything. eat some bed kill pills (if you have) and on the morning do another round.,Price was almost equal as with our booking via ****** which was cancelled 1 day before check-in.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Ap,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 26  2017,9.2,The expense. however. most hotels are in this price range in Boston.,This is an expensive hotel but very well placed for all local attractions in Boston. It felt very safe to walk around the area at night. The staff were extremely friendly and there was 24 hour complimentary coffee and tea. Breakfast was complimentary if you joined Hilton Honours.  Underground station just 2 mins away and very easy to access.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Amy,United States of America,8 Reviews,October 23  2017,7.5,There are no dressers/drawers for clothes (just a small closet with a few hangers) - this was very disappointing.  Our first full day we left at about 9am and came back at 5pm and the room hadn't been cleaned.  I asked about it and they apologized and offered to clean it then. but too little too late at that point.  When they cleaned the room the next day. they left a dirty rag and the window open.  Weird.  The TV is nice but the "chromecast". which seemed like a great benefit. kept losing the internet connection.  We had to have an engineer to our room twice in 2 days in order to reset the system.,The location is very good. with very easy access to subway.  The North End. with tons of great food is about a 10 minute walk.  The property is very nice. and the room nicely and simply decorated.  Bathroom very clean and updated.  Loved the 2 free water bottles each day.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Michael,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 11  2017,9.2,The shower was very beautiful to look at. but was poorly designed. You have to reach under the shower to turn the water on. The opening leaked water onto the floor. Also the window shades were very attractive. but did not operate well at all.,the interior design was very beautiful contemporary
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Katrina,United States of America,1 review,September 11  2017,10,I was charged cash for my valet since it was just a few hours when my friend went to leave and take the car they said that we didn't pay after I paid cash and tipped the valet they argued with her and said they would charge the room then told her goodnight. I called Saturday the following morning to speak to a manager left a voicemail and I still have not heard back. Also. my deposit was not given back to me yet. So I still have the 75 dollar desposit missing from my account.,Very beautiful hotel nice reception staff
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Tuf G,United States of America,12 Reviews,September 6  2017,7.9,Noise from police and emergency vehicles sirens. Plus the roar of the metro all night long,Excellent location right in the middle of downtown. easy to walk everywhere.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Janice,United States of America,1 review,August 15  2017,8.8,Booked room to stay with my 17 yr old daughter.  Bathroom has glass wall in shower into bedroom -- we aren't that transparent in our family.,Location was great -- walking distance to everywhere.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Kevin,United States of America,1 review,August 6  2017,10,The rooms could use some more storage for clothes and ice machines somewhere on the floors would be nice - otherwise all was good,The location is the best thing -it is close to everything
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 18  2017,9.6,Parking is an extra 50 dollars in addition to the fee for staying in the hotel which is a kicker being that the hotel is pricey,The hotel is in a great location. Rooms are wonderful with great views.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Kay,United States of America,8 Reviews,July 12  2017,8.8,Bed was OK. but a little less plush and comfy than expected for such a lovely hotel.  We did hear a bit of subway and street noise but not more than I would expect in a center city hotel. Hotel is not right next to bars or pubs so no late night reveling.,Great location convenient to Boston Harbor. easy to walk to tourist attractions and the great food options in the North End. Plenty of coffee shops etc nearby for quick breakfast or light meal as well. Rooms are newly remodeled in very clean modern style.  Ours had a particularly comfortable extra sofa and nice city views of Boston streets and neighborhood.  Staff members were helpful and friendly.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Rebecca,United States of America,1 review,July 6  2017,9.6,Not much storage and lighting in the room. . We traveled for a stay the better part of a week with children and hence the room became  crowded quickly. but we were still very happy with our stay. Parking was very expensive and they only offered valet. There is a parking garage 1/2 a block away however. but not much cheaper.,Comfortable bed. nicely designed rooms. Beautiful decor and cappuccino machine in the lobby. It was very close to everything and the bus and trolly tour stop is just out the front door.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Daphny_,Switzerland,12 Reviews,June 13  2017,7.5,The cleaning of shower space was not good. furnishture in bathroom is black so I could see the dust. floor had stains and bedroom floor wasn't cleaned as i had to clean my feet prior to getting into bed. Breakfast is not worth $18. breads and croissants are of poor quality. jams are artificial and the fruits were not fresh. Omelete was very good.,Great bed and bed linen. beautiful room. Location is very good and close to the metro station which takes you into back bay if you don't want to walk across the park and it's less than 10min to the harbour. I booked last minute so it was heavily discounted so I was happy with i what i got for the price I paid. however I wouldn't stay here if I had to pay the full price.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Pedro,Spain,1 review,May 29  2017,7.9,The communication from booking was not ready at my arrival and they couldn't find the reservation. they had to call booking and that took a while because the answer was not immediate. all of this caused me a delay in a meeting,Good. clean room and excellent location
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Julie,United States of America,6 Reviews,April 6  2017,5.8,No valet or doorman outside when we arrived. Had to call for someone to come out. Suite extremely noisy from the subway and the staff acted "surprised." Give me a break.  It's like being in a small earthquake every 3 minutes.Lumpy comforters that they obviously laundered wrong. causing the filling to ball up. Entire room looked like some college kid went to Ikea and didn't quite put the furniture together right. Walls poorly painted and sparse. It was probably supposed to look "modern" but just looked cheap. I did a better job putting my dorm room together 25 years ago. Shower that was impossible to get to right temp without putting your arm into the water stream (not fun when it's burning you.) But the worst was the TORTURE DEVICE of a rollaway they brought in for my son. Literally just springs with a sheet over them. The worst bed I have ever seen in any hotel. My son never complains about rollaway comfort and usually falls asleep instantly and even he couldn't sleep on it. I ended up letting him sleep in the king bed with my husband and I slept on the couch. Bellman left our luggage unattended in the lobby while going outside to help someone else. I had to stay back to keep an eye on it. And we tipped $20 for 5 pieces so that's unacceptable.For a hotel that claims to be "luxury" it falls far short. Not even close. Needs to be WAY more attention to detail to even come close.We were going to say there again on the last day of our trip but cancelled and went to the Eliot -- much better all around.,Great location for all the tourist attractions in Boston. Everything in walking distance. Excellent choices for food and drink nearby.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Laura,United Kingdom,1 review,April 6  2017,5.4,There is no room service or hotel restaurant as this is under construction - this isn't made clear from their website.The rooms themselves are poorly finished.,The location is excellent.

Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Jess,Australia,2 Reviews,April 5  2017,9.2,No room service or onsite restaurant at time of stay due to renovations and a planned relaunch of new dining facilities,Heritage building. awesome modern rooms and bathrooms. beautifully furnished luxe rooms. Location is very central and the views from some of the rooms (if you're lucky enough) overlook the Old State House. Hotel is right on the Freedom Trail. and there is also subway station right outside and loads of restaurants around. About only a 15 min cab ride from Boston Airport. or 10 mins from Amtrak's South Station. Staff were fantastic. and had a level of service equivalent to a 5 star establishment. In terms of value for money in Boston. this ticks all of the boxes - a 5 star experience for at the lower-end of the 4 star price range in a fantastic location.

Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Natalie,Canada,1 review,January 30  2017,9.6,No fan in room,The location was amazing! Close to everything.

Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Pam,United States of America,1 review,November 21  2016,9.2,Bath/ shower is awkward.  Hard to get into and weird that there is a window between the bathroom and bed. It was VERY noisy. heard trucks. police. people screaming... all night long,Liked the boutique feel.

Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Stephen,United Kingdom,17 Reviews,November 16  2016,9.2,Not much but the noise of the renovation of the restaurant early on Monday morning. It could have started after nine.,The central location. The heritage of the building and renovation of the rooms.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Sue,United Kingdom,16 Reviews,November 15  2016,6.3,The room rate was extortionate and the restaurant was closed. so the only meal you could have was breakfast. and I went elsewhere so cannot comment on the quality.  I stayed here because I was on my own and didn't want to be travelling to the outskirts of town late at night. but $363.82 (plus taxes) for one night was a huge amount of money to pay for the privilege of being in the centre of Boston.,The room was very comfortable with a nice shower room with a good selection of toiletries provided.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Barbara,United States of America,1 review,November 10  2016,7.1,Bathroom very dark. No tub. shower only.

Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Franz,Switzerland,36 Reviews,October 30  2016,5.4,Very dry. even unfriendly reception. The second receptionist had us wait for a couple of minutes even though we were obviously dripping wet from the rain. On the way to the room. the carpeted floor was worn. In the room itself. the lighting is complicated. the bedside table in our room was damaged (coloured foil would come off). the mobile shower head could not be fixed in position. there was a sock left from the previous? guest under the bed. The room was small. All-in all 300$ for a 90$ experience. Very disappointing for what should have been the last night of our stay in the U.S. The room seemed like a revenge from the receptionist because our presence had disturbed her. We will will obviously avoid the hotel in the future.,The location is o.k. right next to State Street in the financial center. The bathroom size is decent and the shower cabin modern.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Heide,Germany,16 Reviews,October 29  2016,7.9,The renovations were not donetotally in October 2016. but must be o.k. now!,The location of the Hotel is great!could not be better!!!direkt downtown and near (approx.  5 minutes) to the BLUE Line station (state street). so if you arrive at the airport you are within a very short time (2.75$) at the hotel.If you come by car..do not park at the street!! fees ARE VERY HIGHT (55.-$ !!!!) you MUST park in a parking garage..also not cheap).There is coffee in the lobby the whole day. very good.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Stuart,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 28  2016,9.6,N/A,King room was very spacious and comfortable. nice view of the other buildings in and around Ames.

Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Heather,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,October 28  2016,8.3,There was no room service or restaurant or bar. The family dining options very close by are pretty limited and the area felt a little seedy by night. There is a refuge for homeless veterans next door. When we went into the chains nearby such as McDonalds or Dunkin Donuts (with kids we ended up grabbing food there as we didn't want to spend 200 USD for a functional meal) there was security and they all felt a little bit rough around the edges. Valet parking is a good facility but expensive at 50 dollars per day.It's noisy. Bostonians are very keen on the use of their car horns and did so very long and loud in the streets outside until late. The roads outside were also on the emergency vehicle route so there were frequent sirens. This clearly isn't in the control of the hotel. it's a feature of being in a city centre but don't stay here if you need peace and quiet at night!,This hotel is in an excellent location - pretty much everything a tourist would want to see is easily walkable.Our room was clean. beds were comfy. coffee and tea facilities and minibar facilities in the room.Staff were friendly and helpful.Nice to stay in a historic building not a modern concrete box.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Caroline,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,October 28  2016,5.4,Small stripped out rooms. No space for 2 cases.

We were shown to our room straight away and awed by the comfort and style. Having one of the top floor rooms  offered a fabulous view of this beautiful and clean city.  A great last few days to a holiday that had proved a really big adventure
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Charles,United States of America,1 review,October 8  2016,8.8,Room was a bit small. but attractive and bright.,Gorgeous bathroom with large tub;  interesting lighting in room &amp; bath;  great staff! Location was absolutely perfect--close to Faneuil Hall. several of the famous historic sites. Long Wharf. and many interesting restaurants.  Felt very safe walking in this part of the city.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Rosie,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 8  2016,8.8,They were still completing some of the work so the breakfast area was small but the breakfast was good.,The rooms are very smart in a minimalist way but very comfortable with clean lines and lots of light.  The building itself is old but elegant and the internal modernisation effective and stylish.The hotel is no distance from the harbour and close to Quincey Market area.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Patricia,United Kingdom,48 Reviews,October 8  2016,6.3,Expected luxury and comfort and was disappointed with the room which was small and tired.,Location was very good. Daytime staff were genuinely friendly and helpful.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Pietro,Canada,6 Reviews,October 7  2016,9.6,Waited too long for valet to retrieve our vehicle at check out. otherwise. nothing major comes to mind.,Room was very chic and comfortable. the staff made our stay memorable. and the location of this hotel was walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go in Boston.  We will definitely stay here next time we have a craving for Beantown.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Pam,Australia,4 Reviews,October 6  2016,10,Poor lighting in the bathroom. No lighting over mirror. The slightly tatty curtains and blinds indicated that the renovations were still in progress. but they didn't impact on our stay,The central location was fabulous.  Close to everything for the visiting tourist. (also catering for the shopaholic tendencies!) We had a good value for money rate because of the renovation work going on. which didn't affect our stay. Much flasher and larger than our budget usually allows.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Anne,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,October 5  2016,9.6,The price for the the mini bar stuff so we didn't bother. no big deal though. Charge for movies also high so we stuck with PBS. More tea choices would be nice in the room.,So peaceful! Wonderful beds - we had a lovely family room. Great shower &amp; deep bathtub. Molton Brown goodies. Perfect location so close to the centre &amp; Quincy Market.Our two rooms were near to each other.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Boston,United States of America,1 review,October 4  2016,6.3,We arrived and given our room key. entered 4th floor to find a lady dressing. already occupied room.  Very embarrassed for this to happen at this price point.  Second day returned late evening to find room had never been services. towels on floor and bed not-made.  Very strangely managed hotel.  Had to purchased ear plugs to sleep as 4th street noise from sirens every 10-15 minutes echoed in the room with windows not fitted with acoustical windows.,Location was great. bed very comfortable and room adequate just very little closet hanging space
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,John,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 4  2016,7.9,bed was so so comfortable. and the construction going on was kind of a drag...I wouldn't have minded putting up with it for a better price.,staff was awesome. pretty decent location for things to do within walking distance (when the weather is good. which this trip was awful...which of course isn't their fault!).
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Olaj,Nigeria,3 Reviews,October 4  2016,10,I wish the cute blue bottle of water wasn't so expensive.  It should be complimentary - maybe the cost can be factored into the room rate somehow.  I thought it was and had opened it before I saw it cost almost $10!,The bed was very comfortable. The room was very nice
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Meng,United States of America,5 Reviews,October 3  2016,10,n/a,The location of the hotel is terrific. right in the centre of the city. near harbor and the state station is only steps away. The weekend's weather was bad. raining for the whole day on Saturday. if the weather is good. it'll be much nicer to take a stroll along the harbor.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Anonymous,Australia,4 Reviews,October 3  2016,5.0,Traffic noise. poor lighting in room+access areas. need soft + hard pillows. only soft provided. need better . more comfortable chair in room. not roller chair. poor service room. had to ask for maid to do.poor wifi.,Free Coffee lounge + room. +free water.good shower. linen good
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Neil,Spain,39 Reviews,October 3  2016,8.3,If you are not a city dweller the traffic noise in the night could be a problem.,The location of this hotel is great and the smart feel of the rooms added to the stay.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Erica,China,3 Reviews,October 2  2016,6.3,Room service is unstable.

Expensive.,location is very good. close to old state house.CVS. coffee shops.Room is nice. clean. Reception is friendly.
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Stephen,United States of America,1 review,October 2  2016,3.3,-Staff need professional training.

Pretty good Location
Ames Boston Hotel, Curio Collection by Hilton,Jetske,Netherlands,6 Reviews,September 29  2016,6.3,The entry of hotel and the interior of the beakfast room are poor.  Our room on the 15th floor had very small windows and no view. Business center was closed. staff was friendly but not very accurate and alert. To expensive for what it was .,The room was spacious and clean. Nice wooden floor. Good bed.
304 Newbury Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Gretchen,United States of America,1 review,October 7  2017,7.9,The multiple flight of stairs. lighting in bathroom too dark. the fact that we needed to take out the trash and strip beds even though we paid a a housekeeping fee. the sofa bed was not a true pullout sofa bed - it was a trundle bed for a child. window air conditioner not work consistently,Location of apartment and updated modern design. door codes to get into building and apartment was convenient
304 Newbury Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Uk,United Kingdom,1 review,September 20  2017,5.4,There was broken glass on the floor. the tv remote was nowhere to be seen. and it took a lot of chasing via numerous emails and phonecalls to get anything sorted - the cleaners did come and sort the glass out after a few phone calls. but it was at least 24 hours before the tv was working. so we missed the baseball match :-(  .  The property is said to be suitable for 4 people. and yet there were only 3 bowls and 3 mugs. and only 1 duvet cover.,The location was excellent and it has the potential to be a fantastic place. with a little attention to detail (like cleaning. ensuring the tv remote is there. replying to phone calls and emails. having enough mugs / bowls for all the guests etc.)
304 Newbury Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Christie,United States of America,1 review,July 31  2017,9.2,The sofabed mattress was awful!  Could feel and hear springs in the worn out very thin mattress.,Great location!  Close to lots of upscale shops and restaurants.  Bustling during the day but quiet enough at night.  Nice updated apartment and bathroom. all the necessities needed! Clean and comfortable.
304 Newbury Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Taryn,Canada,1 review,July 21  2017,7.9,Our unit was on the third floor. which isn't a big deal. except when you're lugging up everything you need for a family of four (including the kids and a stroller) and it's 100 degrees outside. The sleeper sofa isn't the most comfy to sleep on. but it was fine for the kids.,Location was amazing. walking distance to so many Boston attractions (Fenway. Boston Common. shopping etc). Public transportation also very close by. Unit was clean and equipped with everything we needed for a two day stay. The air con was great. We stayed on the hottest days of the year and our unit stayed nice and cool. The bedroom also has a ceiling fan which helped immensely. Access was easy. both doors had codes which were emailed to me the day before we arrived (along with the wifi password).
304 Newbury Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Vicky,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,July 19  2017,7.9,It's a long slug up the narrow and steep stairs if you have a suitcase! some parts of the apartment are looking tired. the windowsill in the lounge area needs painting. the tap needs fixing on the sink in the bathroom. the kettle needs replacing.  There aren't any skirt hangers and the ones that are there are cheap nasty ones. However. charging over £200 per night and providing nothing is not value for money. I have never rented an apartment anywhere in the world that hasn't provided basics like shower gel and shampoo and most even provide a little welcome pack of tea or coffee and milk etc. Having to strip my own bed when I am paying for the accommodation and you've the nerve to charge $105 cleaning fee is absolutely disgusting and threatening people with extra charges just isn't on. Also. you don't find out any of this until after you've paid. There isn't even any information about where the nearest grocery store is or where the nearest train station is,No keys. Entry codes  Fantastic location Great shopping and restaurants
304 Newbury Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Svetlana,Canada,1 review,June 17  2017,7.1,All the linens and towels smelled excessively of chlorine. The in-window AC was too loud (was a real inconvenience at night) Smoke detector was acting up.,The apartment was really nice. The kitchen was well stocked with all the necessities. Location was really convenient: right in the heart of Back Bay and easy access to the T for venturing further afield.
304 Newbury Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Doug,United States of America,7 Reviews,June 9  2017,9.2,It's on a busy street with lots of shops/ restaurants so it can be a bit noisy outside. This may be an issue for those who are light sleepers...,The location is perfect. I was attending a convention at the Haynes convention center and thus place is literally around the corner.
304 Newbury Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Jane,United States of America,1 review,May 24  2017,9.6,The fan light in the bedroom was not working so although AC unit in the living space. the bedroom was hot.  Were able to open the bedroom window so that helped somewhat but would have been nice to have the overhead fan working.  Notified maintenance to let them know the fan light was not working (or we couldn't get it to work!),Location. location. location!  Comfortable bed and sleep sofa.  Nice to have a living space for 'down' time and full kitchen for snacking.
304 Newbury Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Mirek,Sweden,39 Reviews,May 6  2017,7.5,The apartment was only superficially cleaned. I contacted the manager and the cleaners came the day after and cleaned the worst stuff. even the windows. which I commend them for.Hot water runs out fast. Very expensive for what you really get. compared with e.g. Europe. Impersonal contact. everything is via mail.,Probably the best location in Boston. a stone's throw from Hynes Convention Center. Bright. eautifully furnished apartment. American style. Very nice living. Super comfortable bed. Great view over Newbury street. Very practical with the codes to the doors. no fuss with key.
304 Newbury Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Jennifer,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,May 3  2017,10,The sofa bed was a little uncomfortable but after a long days walking it didn't matter too much. Some noise from the street below but we found it was a great reminder of where we were!,Perfect Base for our trip to Boston with everything we needed.  Loved the hustle and bustle of Back Bay...lots of shops. bars and restaurants nearby (and Fenway of course!)
304 Newbury Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Emma,Australia,5 Reviews,April 29  2017,9.6,Floor was uneven (sloped) due to age of building / shifting over time.  so would caution people particularly elderly or this with balance problems (especially when tired!),Very comfortable bed (soft top on mattress).  Had washing machine and dryer in the flat.  very handy.  Full size fridge with all the appliances.
304 Newbury Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Kimberly,United States of America,1 review,April 10  2017,10,We stayed in a 4th floor walk up; so carrying our bags up 4 flights of stairs was interesting. but we only had to do it once.,Bed was very soft. The view from the 4th floor was amazing.   Plenty of blankets and towels. So close to restaurants. trains. shopping.
304 Newbury Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Eve,Singapore,1 review,January 31  2017,6.3,The heater in the toilet was not working. We were freezing for a couple of days. When we called a guy came over with a portable heater. It was inconvenient and unsafe to have a heater with wires in the bathroom.You should have checked each unit to ensure that ALL electricals work properly before the next client moves in. You should also offer the basic option of a DVD player. so clients can play their movies in-unit.,Location was just great.
304 Newbury Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Carole,United States of America,7 Reviews,January 16  2017,10,Thin walls within unit. windows could be better insulated.,Beautiful view. nice and warm. washer dryer in unit. nicely decorated. comfortable furniture.

304 Newbury Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Emma,New Zealand,17 Reviews,November 25  2015,7.0,The bed was a little uncomfortable as the mattress sagged a lot.It would also be handy to have a kettle in the apartment as not everyone drinks coffee.For short-term lets a few basics like butter. sugar. dish cloths (or powder for the dishwasher) etc would also be good.,The location was good with plenty of cafés. bars. shops on the doorstep. The check-in / check-out process was straightforward as everything was done via email. The apartment was clean.

Two Bedroom Apartment in Downtown Boston by STARS of Boston,Peter,Czech Republic,27 Reviews,August 18  2017,7.1,Money for the appartement payment were withdraw very well in advance from my credit card. The price includes also the fee for credit card payment. although there is no other payment option. The vicinity of the hotel was a bit noisy because of some reconstruction or build works nearby.,Welcome package sent by the provider was fine. including the code for opening the building and rooms. Proximity of a rail station is great.
Two Bedroom Apartment in Downtown Boston by STARS of Boston,Julia,United Kingdom,10 Reviews,August 5  2017,6.7,I didn't get deposit back in time promised - booking.com stepped in to remind them though maybe they would have go round to it without that - and $500 is a steep deposit to risk losing There was a rat outside but I guess that's not a reflection on the apartment; the building didn't smell very nice though (again. that could be the other tenants)It's pretty small for more than 4 - we used the sofa bed but it took up a lot of the sitting area,It's an ok location - 10-15 min walk from station and central BostonWiFi is reliable They send you very clear instructions on finding the apartment and getting in They sent someone the next day when I told them about a couple of issues in the apartment - lights and dishwasher not working
Two Bedroom Apartment in Downtown Boston by STARS of Boston,Debbie,United States of America,3 Reviews,June 25  2017,9.6,Didn't know it was third story walk up,Location was great.

Two Bedroom Apartment in Downtown Boston by STARS of Boston,Vilu,Spain,3 Reviews,June 4  2017,3.3,When we arrived to the apartment there was no hot water nor sheets for the couch.We contacted the hosts but ONE DAY LATER they still could not solve the problem so after hours of discussions we agreed to leave and they would refund us the money.After days without any answer we had to chase them. They finally reimbursed only a part of what they promised. they lied to us and Booking could not do anything to help us.We do not recommend this place!!! We lost one entire day of our vacations discussing with the hosts and they were totally incompetent. We expect from a host to be able to solve unexpected issues or at least. keep their word.,Nothing.
Two Bedroom Apartment in Downtown Boston by STARS of Boston,Chris,Canada,7 Reviews,April 28  2017,5.0,Since everyone has different expectations and needs I'll just describe my expectations and experiences. you make up your mind. I was there for a romantic get-a-way. and wanted some place close to downtown for a decent price.  What we got was a place close to downtown for a decent price. but I REALLY wished that I had spent more. here's why:1. Place is older than pictures make it look. Floors slanted. very narrow stairs leading up to 3rd floor2. Floor was dirty. 3. We had homeless man sleeping on doorway next door.  Neighbourhood is a little dicey. This is a      big city and some areas are more run down than others. this is one of them.4. Half the plugs in bedroom don't work. 5. NOT luxurious in anyway. like your first ever student apartments (maybe worse).6. Only TV in living room is in front of uncomfortable old futon.7. No TV in bedroom. so no real place to unwind comfortably8. Forget watching sports on TV.  We couldn't even watch the Celtics play during playoffs.9. CONSTRUCTION of new condo next door STARTED at 6:45am every morning.  I would guess that       this will continue until 2018 so be aware!  Loud even without construction.10. NOT romantic in anyway. unless you are pining to relive for university days.11. Mattress tended to slide off bed. not sure how??12. Shower curtain fell off twice. Replaced once. we can't be the only ones this happens to.13. Haha. Free food left for us included a box of cracker already opened.,Relatively inexpensive for location near downtown. Subway was 5 min walk away. In Chinatown. if you love the food.  Two bedrooms. and full kitchen. Nice welcome basket of snacks and water. Good communication and welcome package.
Two Bedroom Apartment in Downtown Boston by STARS of Boston,Angela,Canada,6 Reviews,April 8  2017,8.3,Crazy narrow stairs.  Neighbouring building was a bit sketchy but it was close to lots of amenities.,Keyless entry so we didn't have to hunt down the landlord and the place slept five people.
Two Bedroom Apartment in Downtown Boston by STARS of Boston,Lauren,United States of America,1 review,March 19  2017,3.3,The hosts were beyond rude. One of the beds broke. The place was slanted. There was ice on the steps outside and one of us slipped. The complimentary snacks were expired.,N/A

Two Bedroom Apartment in Downtown Boston by STARS of Boston,Casey,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 12  2017,3.8,Cleanliness.  The futon was extremely uncomfortable &amp; did not fold out into a bed. The stairs were from a fun house.,Location
Apartment by Tufts Medical by STARS of Boston,Camille,United States of America,11 Reviews,September 13  2017,8.8,They hold a $500 credit preauthorization that wasnt listed on booking. Its a walk up so was very difficult to carry my suitcase up 4 flights of narrow stairs. Could use better housekeeping there were cheezits scattered along the floor of the guest bedroom and the bathroom could be cleaner,Nicely renovated/decorated 4th floor apartment conveniently located in Downtown/Theatre District. Complimentary snacks/drinks were a nice touch. Much better(and slightly cheaper) than staying at a hotel
Apartment by Tufts Medical by STARS of Boston,Jose,Spain,4 Reviews,August 16  2017,5.8,Generally speaking. the value for money was quite low. The bathroom was not clean and some elements were old and with a bad aspect (shower curtains and rug). The sofa was broken. only half usable. The apartment is on the 4th floor and there is no elevator. Carrying the luggage until the apartment was even dangerous. The windows do not provide a good isolation from outside noise. Very noisy.,Excellent location
The Inn at Longwood Medical,Jenn,United States of America,1 review,October 30  2017,6.3,The staff was not friendly and didn’t explain how the parking worked so at check out they were very rude and I was held up from my departure.,Location was great
The Inn at Longwood Medical,Kim,United Kingdom,10 Reviews,October 27  2017,7.1,only two lifts and one was out of service which meant very long waits.  We were on the seventh floor so we couldn't use the stairs with luggage,Staff were welcoming and the hotel was clean and fairly comfortable although the bed had probably seen better days.  The hotel is a fair way from the real touristy areas but it is only a five minute walk to the nearest train station
The Inn at Longwood Medical,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 16  2017,2.9,Service was rude.  Plywood window was awful.  Room smelled like mold.,My room had a window removed which was replaced with plywood.  A temporary AC was fitted into the window.  The plywood was loose and mosquitos were getting in and street noise was loud.
The Inn at Longwood Medical,Lauren,United States of America,1 review,October 2  2017,8.3,The hvac in the second room I stayed in (I stay in another room there another night earlier in the week) had something wrong with it. It would only go on high whether you had the heat or air conditioning on - you had to have it on because the windows didn't open in that room at all. they did in the other room I stayed. Both these things were a bit of an issue because I prefer to sleep with the windows open.Also - they were completely booked the next night. and I ended up having to stay in Boston when the hospital decided to keep my mom for another day. They don't keep waiting lists. so I had to stay at another hotel within walking distance. It was cheaper and nicer but not as convenient as the Inn at Longwood Medical.,It was less than two blocks from Brigham and Women's hospital. where my mother was being treated. I could visit her easily without having to travel to far.
The Inn at Longwood Medical,J,United States of America,1 review,October 2  2017,9.5,Daily parking rate was $40. with a $25 discounted rate for hospital guests. Brigham &amp; Women's rate was $20/day so we parked in their garage.,Only 5 minutes walk from Brigham &amp; Women's hospital to Longwood Inn. Convenient for my family from FL who booked the room for 6 days. No driving in Boston traffic and they were close enough to the hospital to visit me several times each day while I was recovering  from brain surgery at Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital.
The Inn at Longwood Medical,Kara,United States of America,1 review,September 20  2017,8.8,The restaurant staffing was horrendous.  The restaurant had the worst service EVER.  We enjoyed the breakfast and the food was good once it finally arrived. but they were unsafely staffed and unable to manage the tables that were seated.  Many tables with children around us ended up leaving because they had waiting over 30 minutes just for water and coffee.,Jen Baker at the front desk was amazing ans should be in management - she really gets customer service.
The Inn at Longwood Medical,Michael,United States of America,7 Reviews,September 10  2017,6.3,The housekeeping staff and supervisor are really adamant about getting you out of the rooms early so they can do their cleaning. Be out of your room early or expect a knock on the room door otherwise hang that "Do Not Disturb" card on the door knob if you are planning on staying and don't require any "cleaning". We even had one member of the housekeeping staff snap at us because she "needed to clean" the room. I expected a little better courtesy for their patrons. The air conditioning system seems dated and noisy. The exhaust vent for the bathroom shower/toilet area doesn't work. They don't reserve any of the hotel parking stalls for its patrons even though you have to pay $25 a day for parking. If you leave and return during the day to drop off stuff don't always expect to get a parking stall.,Rooms were clean. The front desk was very attentive regarding a concern for a slowing shower drain. The agent made a call to maintenance immediately. The second floor gains access to the Galleria with its various fast food concessions as well as the Longwood Grill &amp; Bar restaurant. Having a CVS store in the same building is also a plus.
The Inn at Longwood Medical,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 30  2017,7.5,N/A,It is in a convenient location to downtown Boston.  Good value for money.  Not a luxury property. but clean and quiet room. friendly staff. and not a luxury price.  I would stay there again.

The Inn at Longwood Medical,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 27  2017,4.6,The hotel room declarations and booking.com did not match. We booked a double queen rom with 2 beds yet the hotel room descriptions don't match this write up. We had to spend a tremendous amount more for rollaway and adults had to stay in same bed. Completely unsatisfied with this aspect. Probably will use other hotel booking site or go directly to hotel site next time.,Location
The Inn at Longwood Medical,Michelle,Israel,2 Reviews,August 27  2017,7.9,The room did not have a safe. The staff were courteous but could have been more informative.,The beds were very comfortable. I requested an early check in and I was given that which I appreciated after a long flight. The room had a coffee maker. refrigerator and a microwave oven.
The Inn at Longwood Medical,Jeanne,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 23  2017,9.6,A lower price would be appreciated.,Right around the corner from Dana Farber Cancer Institute.  Makes getting to appointments easy.  The King-size bed was wonderfully comfortable. with great linens.
The Inn at Longwood Medical,Christina,United States of America,1 review,July 13  2017,9.2,N/A,Very comfortable room but thought it may have been a little overpriced. The AC blew right on us despite the fact it was not pointed on us and could not be adjusted.
The Inn at Longwood Medical,Eileen,France,27 Reviews,June 12  2017,10,N/A,I found it to be one of the best values for money.....I had a good night's sleep every night. and I loved the fact that it was close to many nice restaurants. It is a safe area and quiet in spite of the fact that our room was facing the road. If I am in Boston I will definitely consider staying here again.
The Inn at Longwood Medical,Eileen,France,27 Reviews,June 12  2017,10,N/A,Wonderful pleasant stay - was expecting a somber mood based on some of the reviews. but it was a very nice hotel with all amenities.

The Inn at Longwood Medical,Anonymous,United States of America,7 Reviews,June 4  2017,6.7,The woman at the desk when I arrived and attempted to check in told me that I did not have a reservation.  When I pulled out a copy of my reservation. she wouldn't look at it and kept telling me that I had no reservation.  I had to insist that she look at the printed reservation I had  before she would do anything but repeat that I had no reservation.  Finally she went to check with a manager and eventually came back and told me that I had had a reservation for the day before but that I did not show up so it was canceled.  Wrong!  Again. I referred her to the copy of the reservation that I was holding in my hand.  Boston was in the midst of a very strong rain event. with street flooding. etc.. and I had been traveling since early morning and was wet and tired.  The prospect of being without a place to stay near the venue where I had to present early the next morning was very unpleasant.  With the intervention of the manager. the hotel finally honored the reservation that I had.  Turns out there were plenty of rooms available. I have never had such an bad check-in experience before. and I hope that I never do again.  I'm not sure that I would ever risk making a reservation at The Inn at Longwood Medical again. which I regret because of its excellent location by Harvard Med.  And then there was the elevator problem:  There are only two small elevators for the entire hotel and one was out of service the entire time I was there. The wait for the elevator the evening a busload of Japanese tourists arrived was well more than half an hour. as they monopolized the small elevator for a very long time.  It was impossible to get on once a few of them had filled the elevator with their many large suitcases and then held it for their traveling companions up and down for many trips. A man who was waiting for the elevator while I was told me that he had been at the hotel six months before and the same elevator was out of service then also.,The location was excellent for me. as I was able to walk to the conference I was attending.
The Inn at Longwood Medical,Rhona,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,May 28  2017,7.9,Noise from ambulances all night. We knew hospital close but didn't know about emergency department.,Had all needed for a base to explore Boston without the in-town price tag.
The Inn at Longwood Medical,Bu,United States of America,6 Reviews,May 25  2017,8.3,One of the two elevators was not working. and the one working elevator was shared by hotel guests. patrons of the Longwood Galleria. and the hotel service staff.,The queen size beds were soft but supportive. perfect for a good night's sleep.We had room 612. which was near the elevator and the ice machine.The hotel's location was good. everything we needed to go to for Boston University commencement activities was accessed by nearby bus stops. which connected us easily to the T.  There were two bus lines. 60 and 65 that took us to the Kenmore Green Line station.The food at the Longwood Grille was surprisingly good.  We had the omelet and frittata for breakfast. the short ribs and steak tips for dinner.  Everything tasted cooked from scratch. they were not heat in the microwave already prepared frozen entrees.  Avoid the pizza though. it was greasy and crunchy.There is a variety of food choices at the Longwood Galleria food court.  The line at Dunkin was too long so got coffee at Red Barn Coffee Roasters. glad I did!  Really liked the sumac chicken and sides at Sepal. but sadly they closed the Longwood Galleria location.The parking was $25 a day for hotel guests. which was reasonable for Boston. and there was a parking lot attendant 24/7 to guide you into the stall. or even park your car for you. Housekeeping was good. response to my requests for extra towels and coffee (Keurig pods) was swift.
The Inn at Longwood Medical,Morris,United States of America,11 Reviews,May 1  2017,10,It was somewhat noisy being near several hospitals to sirens and helecopters coming and going,Convenient location. easy walking distance to several hospitals and a food court in the same building.

The Inn at Longwood Medical,Occasional,Netherlands,1 review,April 6  2017,5.0,This hotel has a terrible noise problem. The back-side which is said to be 'quiet' has enormous noise due to ventilation of adjacent buildings. I needed my noise-cancelling headphones which I use to sleep on long-haul flights to get some rest. The street side still has a fainter humming noise plus street noise (which was more bearable). Overall accommodation is antiquated. Management should invest in refurbishing + look for sources of internal humming noise + double set of windows as is often found in hotels in noisy city areas. This hotel probably only survives because of its location in midst of medical area and relatively cheap price.,Staff permitted me to change room 3 times because of noise problem. which was finally unresolved.
The Inn at Longwood Medical,Gail,United States of America,1 review,February 24  2017,10,Nothing,Immaculate. fantastic staff: Alexandra. Tarik. Angel. Noah. Room very quiet. close to hospital and restaurants. Wonderful overall experience. Highly recommended.

The Inn at Longwood Medical,David,United States of America,4 Reviews,November 21  2016,5.0,The room and the bathroom were quite small.  The heat in our room was set on 74 degrees and we were told it could not be changed!  A fan was brought up to help cool off the room!  Not acceptable.  I will probably not stay here again.,Location was perfect for our trip to visit a friend in the hospital.
The Inn at Longwood Medical,Edward,United States of America,1 review,November 6  2016,7.1,We were touted by book.com for a room. but what was not explained is that the hotel offers a discount for patrons on a medical/surgical appointment at Beth Israel Hospital. We learned at the hotel. and it cost us an extra $300 in room rent. Never book.com again.,The hotel was close to Beth Israel Hospital. where we were going. Parking was adjacent and reasonable in that parking in Boston is always a problem and expensive.
The Inn at Longwood Medical,Douglas,United States of America,1 review,October 27  2016,8.8,Room wasn't super-clean:  Floor needed vacuum and walls/floor of bathroom had a few hairs indicating needed a vacuum or wipe.

The Inn at Longwood Medical,Momof2teens,United States of America,1 review,October 5  2016,9.6,N/A,I was visiting Boston to see my son in college there and booked a room with 2 beds. I called the hotel the day before to let them know I would be in after 9 pm. Unfortunately. they did not have my reservation yet and I had to email it to them. The staff at the hotel was very helpful and assured me I would have a room when I got there. When I arrived they only had a room with one bed instead of two as I was led to believe when I booked through booking.com. When I read the confirmation fine print it did say the room availability is up the the hotel. Thankfully. Brian was the night staff at the hotel and did everything he could to find me a room with 2 beds. Even though he couldn't give me one that first night. he was true to his word and had me transferred into one with 2 beds the next morning. He was very empathetic with my issue. and agreed I shouldn't have been led to believe I was booking a room with 2 beds if it wasn't guaranteed. I travel alot. and usually when a problem arises with a hotel booked through a 3rd party site. the hotel staff just refer you to the booking site for help. Brian went out of his way to help me and I really appreciate his efforts. Upon checkout. another problem arose -the rate was $60 more than what booking.com quoted and again Brian had to help me. He adjusted the rate to match my confirmation email without any breakdown to go on. If it hadn't been for him. my stay at the hotel would have been a disaster. Although I cannot give booking.com a good review. I can highly recommend the Inn at Longwood Medical not only because of the comfort and cleaniness of the rooms. but because of the genuine and helpful staff. Thank you Brian.
The Inn at Longwood Medical,John,Australia,14 Reviews,September 24  2016,3.3,No view except a brick wall or an exhaust pipe from the outside. Rubbish not emptied in room. Maid pulled up the bed and changed towels and that was it. We were evacuated twice during our stay because of fire alarm issues. The lift wasn't working for most of our stay. The location is terrible. No fitness or relaxation facilities on premises. Hotel is very dirty and in need of repair in a lot of areas. Our toilet broke down and had to be fixed. Overall stay was terrible.,Staff tried very hard to keep us happy when we arrived. We had to change rooms 3 times as so many had problems.

The Inn at Longwood Medical,Deborah,United States of America,1 review,August 29  2016,7.1,When looking up Longwood Inn. one goes directly to booking.com. We are asked reason for stay. business or leisure. No where is one asked if there for hospital stay. No where does it say there is a reduced price for hospital stays. And hotel doesn't offer the reduced rate if reservations made through bookings.com. That information should be prominently featured on the inn's website. It is not. If that doesn't change. reduction should be offered after the booking. Hospitalization in Boston is a terrible expense for some people and we could have saved a couple of hundred dollars at a very stressful time. The process is wrong. Bookings.com should at least offer the option as hospitalition as reason for stay. And the parking process is awful.,It was close to hospital
The Inn at Longwood Medical,Diane,Canada,1 review,August 29  2016,10,N/A,The staff was very welcoming and helpful. The rooms are very clean and the bed was very comfortable.

The Inn at Longwood Medical,Sheila,United States of America,1 review,August 9  2016,7.5,Our room was big but the shower and toilet were in a small space separate from sink. you could barely fit in there and when you open the door you had to maneuver in or out.,Great location if going to Fenway.

The Inn at Longwood Medical,Cal,Australia,22 Reviews,August 3  2016,5.4,It's so expensive for one of the most average motel-quality rooms ever.

The Inn at Longwood Medical,Anonymous,Canada,1 review,June 5  2016,8.8,The bed could have been more firm and the carpets softer.

The Inn at Longwood Medical,James,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 20  2016,5.4,Booking.com screwed up. The 2 queen suite that we reserved for 4 people was downgraded to a "King kitchenette" with only one bed for the four of us. The hotel said this is equal in their contract. This was a disaster  Bad value and a big let down from Booking.,Checkin was quick and smooth until we got to our room and found we did not get the two queen suite we requested.

The Inn at Longwood Medical,Anonymous,United Arab Emirates,1 review,May 12  2016,8.8,Booking.com DID give us the best price available online (thank you); however. we then found out that we were eligible for 'medical' discounts which we were not aware of.  We were told that we should've called before booking through a third party. I didn't think that was fair because the official website didn't show me any available rooms to begin with! Obviously we didn't get a refund.,We were there visiting the Brigham and Women's Hospital. The location was perfect. There's a decent restaurant. food court. underground public parking. barber and pharmacy in the same facility. We ended up using them all. There were a lot of things at walking distance too. For those who just NEED their Starbucks... yup! There's one right there!

The Inn at Longwood Medical,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,April 19  2016,4.2,They charge in advance for incidentals. a policy that seriously impacted my return travel. What's more. when I tried to use that incidental money I was unable to order room service thanks to them being seriously understaffed. even on the marathon weekend. My hungry child and I braved the adjoining food court that reeked of urine. only to find that most of the restaurants were closed on a Saturday evening. We ended up having to get drug store sandwiches. Their advance incidental charge at up more than $100 of my cash. and left me without the option of taking a cab to the train station. It was either take a cab or have money to eat. Thanks. Inn at Longwood.,The room was fine and the beds were comfortable.

The Inn at Longwood Medical,James,United States of America,16 Reviews,March 24  2016,7.1,Approach to front door in a car is a problem. We pulled into parking for the Inn. pulled a ticket.band found that the first 0-60 minutes to drop luggage would cost $9.00. No staff member to let us out. Parking typically is $38/day and hotel has deal for $23/day. but you have to exit by 12 noon the next day. My meeting ended at 1:15 pm. Got charged $23 plus $9 for 1-2 and then another $3 for 1 to 1:15. ( I had asked front desk for recommendation of nearby less expensive parking. ?He said he knew nothing about it. ) And my departure was delayed by 15 min because three trucks were allowed to park so as to block my car into its space. Had to chase down the truck drivers. who were fixing something inside the building.nWhen I asked parking agent to cut me some slack on account of the delayed exit. He laughed in my face. Nice Bostonian spirit on display.,N/A

The Inn at Longwood Medical,Rebecca,United States of America,7 Reviews,February 16  2016,6.7,The dingy dated decor...&amp; the old way too soft bed. Oh &amp; the price.,The distance to the hospital my husband has been staying at for over a month is about a block...which was the best part about this hotel...if the rate would have been reasonable I probably would have stayed here the entire time...however the rate-even the hospital rate is insanely high (around $169/night+tax)..Now. I will say it was clean. and there was a nice sized fridge &amp; microwave in the room.  For a couple nights stay I think it's fine but if you need to stay longer you can find better deals elsewhere in the city...ie: I stayed at The Verb hotel for 3 weeks for an average of around $130/night...

The actual hotel is a townhouse with rooms converted to hotel rooms.  They were rather tired but clean.  There were some odd things in our room. such as a huge built in piece of furniture that had air conditioners stored  in it.  Overall I think that the location was the best part. Easy walk to Fenway. Newbury Street. The Prudential (where we parked the car).  There is no elevator- so do not bring a lot of heavy luggage

They had a room for relaxation. with a coffee machine. TV etc. However they closed it at 7pm and we had no jug in our room. We had a microwave so we made our drinks in that which wasn’t really satisfactory. The bed was up against the wall. so it was really hard for one of us to get in and out of the bed which incidentally sagged a little.,We loved the area we were staying in. Beautiful house and surrounds. We were reasonably close to everything - shops. metro. laundromat etc. We felt very safe in this area.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Anonymous,United Kingdom,12 Reviews,October 15  2017,4.2,I called in 2 weeks earlier. when we arrived at Boston. to ask about car parking on-site. I was told they had none for our night.On arrival. our bill didn't make sense. We had been charged for on-site parking.We were credited the difference.We were due to be on the 4th floor but that room allegedly had a leak so we were re-located to a room in the cellar.,The convenience of the location.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Stella,United States of America,6 Reviews,October 13  2017,6.7,Was not as clean as I expect and needs some remodeling. The bathroom ceiling over the shower is being held up with tape. Showers need non slip tape. Almost fell getting in. Just need overall fixing up.,Historic building
463 Beacon Street Guest House,William,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 13  2017,3.8,No elevator and lugging luggage up 4 floors.  No for Seniors or anyone with knee problems!Man at desk very unfriendly. Not helpful in the least!,Historic - Kennedys had slept there!Very quaint
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Katherine,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 12  2017,6.3,Pillow case (and therefor presumably all of the bedding) were not cleanAccess to coffee shuts in the evening. would like access on return from dinner out.Staff member on reception was a little short and off in his temperament. not rude as such but awkward.Overuse of freshener (makes you suspicious about what they are trying to mask!Take light luggage as was hard work to 3rd floor and i believe there are 5 floors (no lift).,Location is great for Fenway Park. 30 mins to Boston common and a further 10-25mins into downtown Boston.Large room (Honey fitz). nice neighborhood. grand old building.Option to per-book parking on-site but limited availability.State of building not as bad as other reviews. we were 3rd floor. Its dated in places but okay.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,lowryepp,United Kingdom,13 Reviews,October 12  2017,6.3,It is a bit basic - but everything is there AND SEE + ABOVE,Other reviews are full of gloom and doom - but they miss the point. This is staying in a piece of history - a Boston up-market brownstone house. Sure the rooms are a bit small. but full of original features; the odd scruffy fitment is overbalanced by the style. There is no lift (elevator) but there is a gorgeous asymmetrical sweelping staircase. You can walk into town. about 20 minutes. or get the metro from 4 blocks away
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Cookie68,Australia,5 Reviews,October 12  2017,3.8,The four flight of stairs. the room was dated and in disrepair. The bathroom was disgusting. The pillows were horrible and the quilt was dirty. There were no fans as it was hot. We were lucky the window opened to let some fresh air in. Not an enjoyable experience,The location and that was it
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Gerard,United States of America,10 Reviews,October 12  2017,4.2,A very bare bones operation. more a hostel than a guesthouse. The evidence suggests the owner pays scant attention to room maintenance (leaky pipes. peeling paint. unbelievably thin yet lumpy pillows) or guest comfort (no a/c or fans when the temp is near 80. no staff on premises after 2 in the afternoon. no coffee available until 9 in the morning). I know Boston is expensive. but $159 for a  stuffy closet is no bargain. If he/she/they want to compete with air bnb. they might want to think about caring more rather than less.,Beautiful old house in a nice neighborhood.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Dickie,Indonesia,5 Reviews,October 12  2017,7.9,Since it is fall. we didn't have a problem with the temp of the room. I would think summer would make the room a bit warmer. I didn't pay attention if there is AC in the room.,The location is very strategic. You are within walking distance to MIT Campus. Charles River. Fenway Park. Newbury Street. Boylston Street. Copley Area. and Boston Commons. Parking would be hard. but that sums up the area and not just this property.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 11  2017,10,The cleaning spray they use in the building &amp; rooms was too strong for us. Thankfully it aired out during the day by leaving the window open. The room was so delightful. like a step back in time! The room was very spacious. with a fridge and microwave.,We felt like we lived on a brownstone.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Lynne,Australia,46 Reviews,October 8  2017,6.3,Being on the fourth floor with no elevator was not easy. but we did know of this situation in advance.,Location was good. not far from public transport and restaurants. The bed was comfortable. and we never had to wait for the shared bathroom.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Michael,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 5  2017,6.3,Bed room was smaller than the bathroom. Bed itself was fine. Pillow was lacking a little fill. Office hours are very limited (9A-2P).,Room was clean upon check in. Lots of character.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Anca,Germany,6 Reviews,October 2  2017,6.7,The room was worn out. the door didn't close well. but was quiet enough.,The Guesthouse is quirky. with an colonial charm. We stayed for one evening. good value. Location is great!
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 1  2017,3.3,Quite run down. especially for the price. The most annoying part was the fact that in our 4-day stay. even though we hung the 'Service. please' sign on the door &amp; requested it at the front desk. we never received even fresh towels. Not cool.,The location.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Martina,Ireland,4 Reviews,October 1  2017,4.2,Everything except for the great locationThe bed wasn't good quality.,The location was the only good thing about this property. It wasn't even a hostel.The bedroom was tiny but that was ok. the paint was peeling off. the decor was soooo old.The shower never got hot.I really can't believe they could charge so much for this place.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Judy,United States of America,1 review,September 30  2017,3.3,The interior has the potential to be wonderful. but it was run down. The room was nice but the bathroom was horrible. Not very clean. very small shower and a leaky ceiling. When we asked for fresh towels. we never received them. Office hours are inconvenient too.,The building was beautiful in a quaint. historic street
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Amy,United States of America,1 review,September 28  2017,6.7,The room wasn't ready when we arrived at 11 am.  Check in is posted as 9-1:00.,we had problems getting the tv to work;  called and left a message and they sent someone to fix it within half hour.  It was very quiet. too.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Greg,Australia,12 Reviews,September 26  2017,4.2,As above.,The guesthouse works under false pretences or false advertising. if it wasn't so serious it would be comical.Our room was on the 4th floor which was awkward for us with two suitcases and  when we proceeded to open the door of our room it literally hit the bed so we could only open the door a third of the way..the door was also patched up around the lock area and was not secure by any means. The bed had hairs on the sheets not very hygienic or welcoming for a 4 night stay. There was not staff in attendance till 9am the next morning and we then proceeded to request another room which seriously was not much better!!! Would probably be a good idea if the Guesthouse name was changed to "Faulty Towers" totally useless and not very helpful or apologetic for the way we found the room and certainly not worth the money paid.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Anonymous,United States of America,13 Reviews,September 24  2017,5.8,Beautiful old brownstone. however it has not been updated or even painted since the 80s.  Not kept up well at all. The bathroom was disgusting with tiles falling off the ceiling. Felt like a dirty old motel six. Lost a sock under the bed and was scared to go grab it. Looks like things are petrifying under there. .  The only blanket on the bed was a duvet cover since the 80s and I'm pretty sure it's not getting washed since then. Didn't even bother rpleacing one of the three different bulbs burned out in the bathroom.  Sad because it would be a beautiful place with just even a little care and pride put in.,N/A
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Melanie,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 23  2017,8.3,N/A,I thought the place was fine.  It's pretty much a hostel. shared bathroom on each floor.  It's a quiet central location in an old brownstone building.  My friend didn't like the place and said the bathroom was gross but I found everything charming and the bathroom wasn't as horrible as she made it out to be.  Make sure to reserve a parking spot because there are only 2 available!
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Anonymous,Australia,29 Reviews,September 23  2017,7.1,Wifi varied from patchy to slow to not even bring an option to connect to.,Location is nice and a reasonable walk to public transport and the Hynes Convention Centre complex. We arrived after staff were on duty but we had emails telling us how to access the key for our room and front door.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Robert,United States of America,1 review,September 20  2017,7.1,Mattress very soft and too bouncy.  Plumbing a problem; toilet tank wobbled and I had to keep wiggling the toilet handle so it would stop running.  Less elegant and more simply dilapidated.  I usually stay in name brand hotels but they were so expensive I figured I would try a guest house.  I don't know about the other rooms in this guest house; I was in the Marathon Room on the fifth floor. It will probably be a while before I try a guesthouse again.,Common areas were lovely.  Short walk (under 10 minutes) to Hynes Convention Center.  Staff carried my heavy bag up to room without my asking.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Dawn,United States of America,1 review,September 20  2017,6.7,The manager who did not identify himself was very gruff and annoyed that I had arrived before 3 even though the guesthouse asks you to arrive by 1 when the office is open.  I tried to stay nice but he seemed really mean. He stayed that way even when I left off the keys upon departure. The room was not cleaned after the first day either.,Very nice cleaning/maintenance person named Hubert assisted me in my room upon arrival. Location of guesthouse is wonderful. Tory at the desk was very nice.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Serena,United States of America,1 review,September 20  2017,10,Took a little bit for the water to heat up when I showered.,The cozy feel of the room. It was small but just enough for me. The bed was comfortable. Room wasn't too hot or too cold.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Jocelyn,United States of America,16 Reviews,September 18  2017,5.4,I stayed at Franklin room. where the furnitures looked as ancient as the room's namesake (Benjamin Franklin). Bed uncomfortable. only 1 thin pillow available. No AC which I did not mind this time of year (mid-Sept.). but had to get electric fan changed since the one originally there was not working. TV remote looks like it needs battery changed. Bathroom a bit dusty near fire escape window.,Location- within walking distance to Hynes Convention Center. where I attended conference. Also within walking distance to Boston Public Garden (nice to walk along Commonwealth Ave. to get there). and nice establishments along Boylston from Hynes to Public Garden. Also close to Back Bay.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 16  2017,8.3,Walk-up to 5th floor was challenging with luggage. but they had clearly advertised that so it was not a surprise. and staff at check-in (if you come early when they are open) offered to help which was appreciated.  The air conditioner was right next to the bed so had to turn it off at night because of the noise.  There was no overnight parking that I could find near the guest house. and they had warned that it was limited on-site but I didn't realize there was no parking within a reasonable walking distance either (street parking was limited to residents with permits. or a few short-term spots with parking meters). so I would skip the rental car next time and stick to alternate transportation.,Excellent location on residential street that was quiet and seemed safe to walk at night.   My room on the top floor (long and narrow. as advertised in their photos) was simple but comfortable. and I enjoyed the attached balcony which had privacy and a view towards the river and Fenway Park.  Maybe not the best choice if you want the comfort and amenities of a 5-star hotel. but I enjoyed the simplicity and uniquely Boston experience.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Karen,United States of America,3 Reviews,September 12  2017,6.3,Shower was super small. bathroom was not very nice but at least we had our own and did not have to share.  Bed was very old and you could feel the springs in areas.  A/C barely worked. thank goodness it got cooler at night however the other window would not stay open.  I would stay here again just dont expect anything too nice.,Historic feeling property. great atmosphere and in a great location to explore Boston as long as you dont mind walking a bit.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Stephen,United States of America,1 review,September 11  2017,4.2,The rooms were dirty. Bathroom layout and fixtures were awful with old and cheap fixtures.Plastic shower stall was disgusting. There no staff around for the entire weekend untilSunday morning. Nobody made appearance to welcome us. The lounge was closed at 8 am and at 7p which prevented guests to have a comfortable place to relax.,The location and the Victorian charm.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Christopher,United States of America,1 review,September 5  2017,7.9,N/A,The location of the property was excellent. we could walk EVERYWHERE!  The place was pretty much what I expected based upon reading the reviews and information before I booked.  I stayed in the "Longfellow" room and it was just fine.  Roomy enough. moderately comfortable bed. it was generally clean.  The shower was rather tight. but again I expected this based upon reading ahead of time.  The staff instructions to get into the place after hours and to park in my prepaid space were very clear and understandable.  The room was quiet. the WIFI was just fine (I would recommend that once you connect to the WIFI. that you restart your device. after that there was no issue with it being "spotty" at all).  The night we arrived the DirecTV wasn't working. I mentioned it to the staff in the morning. and it worked perfectly when I arrived back to the room and there was no problem at all the rest of my 4 night stay.  I recommend this property if you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel (based upon prices in the area) with not a lot of frills. but centrally located and a decent value for the price.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Petronella,Hong Kong,12 Reviews,September 3  2017,4.6,Our room "Marathon" was on 5th floor without elevator. high stairs. No help with suitcases. Room had microwave and fridge. but only 1 cup and 1 glass. 1 wineglass and 1 knife. 2 plastic forks and spoons. Could not go to washroom without a very noisy fan starting to blare. And on top of it all: there was a big EXIT sign lit in red in my room. apparently my room was the emergency exit. How can one sleep like that? Not allowed to open one of the doors. apparently the door to another room. as mine was their emergency exit. So they could just enter my room (?) Internet very slow.,location was convenient. Had a nice little balcony/rooftop to sit on. TV was nice.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Virginia,United States of America,1 review,September 3  2017,4.6,The bed linens were old and tired. Coverlet and upholstered furniture just plain grime-y. Mildewed soap dispensers empty.  A horrid plastic shower stall in the Honey Fitz room had a scale encrusted shower curtain that you had to tuck in around your feet so the water wouldn't go everywhere. Gross. Hair in the corners.  No bath mat.  The ceiling was coming down after a BAD leak. Totally third world looking. Never have I ever been forced to use towels so old and crunchy. They felt exactly like the ones that you'd wring out and dry on the driveway after washing your car. Astonishing. Windowsills were black with soot. The rug had never been cleaned. Shocking for $200. And this was their featured suite!!!,The neighborhood was exceptionally beautiful. Storybook.18th century houses and manicured lawns on tree lined streets. However. comparatively. this building was sloppily maintained. Cheap cheap locks on doors were laughably inadequate. Sad because the building is one of the most beautiful;  the lobby and staircase. a wonder of historic architectural details. The staff has very limited hours. Don't expect to have access to coffee in the morning. They just aren't  around- and have nothing to say to you while you stand there at 9:05 waiting for them to unlock the parlor door.  Appears to be run by a couple of students with the proprietor grunting orders from a backroom off the lobby. So weird and unwelcoming.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Justine,United States of America,1 review,August 28  2017,7.9,It still has the original Bostonian appeal from when the house/building was built.  All the rooms are original and unique.  If you're really picky. this isn't the place for you.  There are little imperfections everywhere.  It's not fancy. it's homey.,Location was perfect for walking distance to Fenway Park.  We went pretty much everywhere by foot.  There are shops around the corner and plenty of places to eat within 10/15 minute walk.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Lomoki,Netherlands,6 Reviews,August 27  2017,5.8,My sleeping room didn't have a window and the bed was very uncomfortable.,The location of the guesthouse is great. In walking distance from MIT. Fenway park and city center.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Patsfan,United States of America,1 review,August 25  2017,5.0,For $300 for two nights I expected air conditioning!   It was really. really hot!!  The room was no bigger than a closet the bathroom is actually bigger. The staff didn't really seem friendly actually I just say uninterested in the guests.,Location was fantastic so close to Fenway Park the hard rock café the Prudential Center to do the duck tours. The house itself was amazing and very old building very cute
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Rhonda,United States of America,5 Reviews,August 23  2017,7.5,I knew upfront so I made the choice - no air conditioner.  I guess my expectations was that normal amenities would be included.  Carpet and bed needs to be replaced and found the price of the small room rather high compared to amenities that you can get at nearby hotel. It felt more like a hostel. The furniture was old 80's.  Unfortunately. I will not return back because it's pricey for a short time with little amenities.  Thanks for asking.  Not trying to complain about the guest house but there are better places for less cost.   If the place would had been priced lower. such as $60/$75 a night. then the cost would feel justifiable.  I had a very tiny room for $142 a night.  Nearby hotel was $99 a night.,The location to Fenway Park.  A short walk.  Nearby food and pub.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Catherine,France,14 Reviews,August 23  2017,6.7,My room was extremely poorly noise insulated. I could hear my neighbor TV louder than my own.AC consisted in an air vent on the floor. with no control panel. There was a cold draught on my bed that I could not turn off.The window was very small and high. Il could not see the outside from the room.,I was in a single room that was very tiny but confortable enough for one night. After check-out. the staff was very nice to let me rest a little in the common room and to keep my luggages for a few hours. Note that the reception is only open in the morning.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Ed,Australia,17 Reviews,August 23  2017,5.8,A clear explanation that this room (the Marathon Room) was nothing like all of the others that were beautifully presented period rooms which were very well  appointed with space. style and comfort.,We arrived after hours.  The room was a pokey closet with a bed that sagged in the middle.  The room was on 5th floor (115 steps) that did not live up to the adds.  It did have a balcony but the room was worse than the servants' quarters.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Shamika,United States of America,15 Reviews,August 21  2017,6.5,The lack of AC unit or fan in the room. The room was not nearly as cool as it could have been. a window AC unit would have been great. I actually had a hard time sleeping due to the heat and it was only made worse by the guest next door watching the Sox game at full volume. The lack of onsite amenities was also inconvenient. There is a coffee bar but it didn't open until 9 am and I was gone by 8 am.,It is a cute brownstone that given its age seemed to be in decent shape and in a decent location.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Alastair,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,August 20  2017,8.3,N/A,Brilliantly located for Fenway Park. you can walk there in 15 mins. we stayed here for a Red Sox game. Parking is by reservation so make sure you do this as soon as possible if traveling by car
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Kathryn,United Kingdom,1 review,August 20  2017,5.8,We had a "please service room" sign on our door for the duration of our 4 day stay and it was ignored every day. We really only wanted the bin emptied. The maid was definitely in as we walked past her on at least one of the the days fixing up a recently vacated room. We arrived on our first day there to a bed that didn't look properly made/ sad looking pillows and no simple amenities like hand soap. I don't mind bed clothes/towels lasting us for the four days without change; however. the bin situation was unacceptable. The room only had one bin which was in the bathroom. Useless for a room which encourages self catering (microwave/crockery and cutlery available). Nowhere to easily wash stuff (only a small bathroom sink and no washing liquid) and because of no maid service. we could only use each item once and then leave it on the worktop to be dealt with after we left. By the end of our four day stay. our bin was overfull and we had to stack all our additional rubbish around the base of it. Bathroom and kitchen rubbish alike. The fact that they provide a "please service room" sign to be hung on the door should mean that they're willing to accommodate this request instead of letting bins fester in warm rooms. I should add. we spent most of our time outdoors enjoying Boston but regular evening snacks like juice bottles and snack packets were enough to leave the bin useless after a couple of days. Worse if you're a female needing the bin for hygienic disposal of personal products!! Completely unacceptable.,The location was amazing.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Micah,United States of America,1 review,August 18  2017,5.8,They had our reservations wrong. one person instead of two. I had to show documentation that the reservations were made for 2,Location to ball park and train station
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Elizabeth,United States of America,1 review,August 17  2017,7.9,N/A,Large 3rd floor room with a small private bath; window unit AC cooled the room off fairly quickly. It's a beautiful old house. now converted into guest rooms; it's not a hotel or a B&amp;B. I can't speak to other rooms. but I would stay there again (making sure I had a private bathroom &amp; AC).
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Kat,Germany,8 Reviews,August 17  2017,5.8,Sadly. our room was not clean. The linen were quiet dirty. as if a cat had slept in the bed.,I quiet liked the interieur and the impressive structure. It looked very comfy.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Jeffrey,United States of America,1 review,August 14  2017,7.1,We stayed in room 401 The Longfellow Room (4th floor by stairs). The room had some sort of air freshener smell that was a little strong for our taste. The bed was firmer than we are used to. The bathroom was reasonably sized but had a tiny sink wedged in next to the tiny stall shower. One wall of the bathroom was an old wooden cabinet with doors and draws that is being used to store window air conditioners.,This property is 100+ year old Brownstone in Boston’s Back Bay neighborhood; that has been “cut” up into a guest house from what was once probably a 4+ floor single family home. This leads to interesting layouts and weird size rooms and bathrooms. My wife and I choose this economical option so we did not have to drive home late at night after an evening event. The room was reasonable sized and our request for extra pillows was granted. We are both more than comfortable walking and using public transportation to get around.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Kelsey,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 9  2017,7.9,The room needed to be cleaned better (I stepped on a small piece of glass while barefoot right when we got there; while checking under the bed to make sure we didn't leave anything behind at check-out it was clear that it hadn't been swept anytime recently) and the bathroom was obviously not a bathroom originally (exposed piping behind the toilet and the shower was just a shower stall that was added - it was tiny and reminded me of a shower you'd see at a campground). The bathroom wasn't very clean; it really needs a good cleaning and basic maintenance (replacing the tiles about the shower that were literally being held together with duct tape). That being said. we picked this place because of it's location and pricing. which couldn't be beat. We were out sight-seeing and doing all of the touristy-things. so we really only used the room to sleep and bathe. I would definitely stay again. but probably request a different room (we walked by some that were open when we were checking out and they looked gorgeous and the pictures online showed bathrooms that looked quite nice).,The location and price can not be beat. We were about a half mile from Fenway. a little over a mile from Quincy Markets; we pretty much walked everywhere. If you are looking for extra amenities that a 5-Star Hotel provides. this isn't the place for you. The staff that we dealt with was kind and courteous. We stayed in the Honey Fitz room and it was a pretty good size and adorable. It is a classic brownstone and really was just beautiful. The neighborhood is fantastic; my husband and I attended a Red Sox game that went into extra innings and we felt perfectly safe walking back at 1 am. You can also pay for parking. which is nice since we drove and didn't want to leave our car in a parking garage or lot.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Anonymous,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,August 9  2017,5.4,Bathroom was in dire need of a refurb - things that would cost very little I.e. Replacing the shampoo dispenser in the shower as it was broken.Bathroom dirty - dust and cobwebs everywhere. no toilet roll or towels in the dispensers provided. no sign of anyone having cleaned the shared bathroomDuring our 3 night stay. Bedroom dusty &amp; floor needed a good hoover - again no one came to clean the room whilst we were there.Staff only there between 9 &amp; 2. those that were there had very poor customer service to say the least - they appeared bored and impatient. Air con unit very noisy. I wear silicone earplugs and you could still hear it. No hairdryer or iron facility and as staff were rarely there we could not ask for them. No lift - we were on 4th floor and it was a struggle with cases - we are 30 &amp; exercise daily! I only had sight or sound of one other person during our stay which suggests the hotel was not full and we could have had a room on a lower floor.,Size of the room bigger than we thought it would beBed was comfy Good location - lovely old building
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Iryna,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,August 9  2017,4.2,Very old facilities. Door into the room didn't close properly; conditioner very noisy; shower knob got stuck several times. and I ended us using the communal shower and had to call out-of-hours service. The person at the desk promised to look into this but nothing was done. I subsequently came back to Boston and stayed in a much nicer hotel. which was cheaper and at a better location.,Location
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Jennifer,Spain,33 Reviews,August 7  2017,5.8,The furnishings and furniture in our room were quite outdated and not in the best shape. The bathroom on our floor was quite small and very messy when we arrived.,The location of this guest house was great. It's a beautiful building as well. full of character.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Izabela,Poland,27 Reviews,August 7  2017,5.0,- Small. not clean room!!!; floor needs hoovering. table - dusting and cleaning!!! all other things were sticky and gooky. - shared bathroom was dirty!!!- coffee downstairs from 9am to 7 pm only!!!- reception open only from 9 am. to 1 pm - rare and inconvenient. No responce to e-mails during my stay- wifi didn't work properly;- my rooom was eqipped with the emergency exit. thus there was no AC!!!  (such information is not even provided at the guest house  official internet site!!!); additionally I have got an extra red light from the emergency sign for the whole night!!! - there was an entry to the attic at the ceiling....but partially open!!!,Perfect location; nice little kitchen in the room - fridge. microwave
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Cerisee,United States of America,11 Reviews,August 5  2017,6.3,Our room was small and lacked adequate electrical outlets. which I understand is normal for a facility as old as the Beacon Street Guest House.  The Revere Room is not nearly as comfortable as the Bostonian. which we stayed in previously.  Having a small double bed up against the wall leaves one of us having to crawl out of bed and makes it inconvenient.  There was no place to put bottled water or a phone. etc.,I liked the location and the fact that for the most part. the room was very quiet.  I have to have a microwave and refrigerator whenever I stay out of town. so that was definitely convenient.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,David,United States of America,1 review,August 5  2017,9.2,We are clean freaks. so some areas were a little dusty. but acceptable for our one night stay. We only slept there. Great weather for our 8 miles of walking around the city.,Location was the best. Very walkable to many desireable locations ( Fenway Park. Public Gardens. Boston Common. Statehouse. shopping. etc.)Microwave and small fridge were added bonus.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Ben,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 4  2017,5.4,A little run-down (but clean). Common rooms and some guest rooms are not air conditioned. Check carefully when booking. I was in a room without conditioning on a 90-degree day. Staff is only there from 9 to 1.,Reasonably priced. especially for this part of Boston.

463 Beacon Street Guest House,John,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,August 2  2017,7.5,Our room on floor two was excellent. The room on the third floor was very poor. the bathroom especially poor and in need of refurbishment. A good clean of the shower would help.,Great location.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 2  2017,2.9,THIS WAS THE WORST PLACE I HAVE STAYED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE: 1) NO AIR CONDITION; 2) NO BATHROOM; 3) DIRTY FALLING APART ROOM. 4) LOCKED COFFEE/LOUNGE UNTIL 9 A.M.!!!! 5) HOT ROOM; 6) CEILING CRACKING; 7) OUTLETS THAT DID NOT WORK; 8) INTERNET SIGNAL DID NOT WORK IN ROOM; 9) SHARED BATH SUCKED! THE SHOWER WAS AS SMALL AS A COFFIN.,NOTHING AT ALL.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Raymond,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 31  2017,4.6,My room as on the fourth floor walk up! Was very small and narrow. so narrow when you opened the door it hit the bed about half open. It was also labeled as an fire exit on the door with a illuminated exit sign over the interior window that stayed on all night! Very distracting! Very basic accommodations. BYW the room was named the   Bruin room as it was was fitted with Boston Bruin items. Do yourself a favor don't stay here unless you can see pictures of your you room before! In addition the shared bathroom was old and basic the vanity top was broken and moved on the base if pushed on it! The shower stall was only about 6 ft tall so the shower   head was about face high and had to duct down to wash your hair! However. plenty  of hot water! More like a $50.00 room than a $100.00 room I was charged! My basement studio apartment 35 yrs ago was a 100% better.,I choose the property for it location as I had previously lived in the back bay.
463 Beacon Street Guest House,Andrea,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 31  2017,7.1,Facility is definitely historic. but needs upgrading.  Had no hot water one day.  It was fixed. but a general face lift in the room and facilities would be good.  Staff blocked in my car without leaving a note and we were nearly late for our appointment as a result.,Staff was responsive.   Location is excellent and close to the MIT campus

463 Beacon Street Guest House,Mark,United States of America,1 review,July 29  2017,7.1,The cost could have been lower. since their were stairs and the rooms were small. but this is Boston and anything else would have been higher.,I found the room and lodging appropriate. clean. and with easy access.  Before arriving. I had been concerned after reading some of the reviews. but I did not experience any of the negative issues others reported.  I realize that some individuals may stay in a guesthouse thinkin that they are going to experience a luxary hotel accommodations.  This facility was not a luxury hotel. but it was what we needed it to be.

463 Beacon Street Guest House,Caroline,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,July 12  2017,7.5,Room very small and not that clean. The bed linen and towels were clean. but the room overall was a little grubby. Floor really needed hoovering. table and other surfaces needed dusting. and the crockery was all a little crusty. You could get coffee downstairs but not until 9am.,Location perfect. Street was beautiful as was the house itself. Smelled of pine trees and lovely greenery. Had my own shower and loo. and a little kitchen corner with fridge. sink. microwave. and crockery for one person. Comfy (single) bed. Nice big fluffy towels.

Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Merhavd,Israel,10 Reviews,September 24  2017,7.5,We were on the upper floor. There was a noise all day and night. I believe it comes from the air condition equipment on the roof. We had asked to replace the room but the only available room was on the second floor and had other noises. so we stayed in our original room.,The staff was very friendly. The room is good except the noise - see the next paragraph.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Ege,Cyprus,11 Reviews,September 22  2017,7.5,The windows were facing the walls of next building. Size of the room was insufficient.,The breakfast was very expensive. Location was a little bit far away from center.

Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Michelle,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 18  2017,6.7,There was a lot of dust on the walla and fixtures in the room-- it was really built up.

Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Business,United States of America,1 review,August 17  2017,7.9,N/A,Nice. modern hotel.  Good location.  Only drawback was that you cannot open the windows. so no fresh air.  Hope they regularly switch out their air filters!  They have a daily fee added on to the pre-payment which I think is too much. shouldn't have this fee at all.  Staff very friendly and nice.

We had already checked out. so we were just waiting in the lobby.,We liked how the room was decorated. Very cute. Great location to the TD Garden.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Dino,Canada,1 review,August 11  2017,9.2,N/A,Staff was fantastic.

Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Cornelius,United States of America,13 Reviews,July 10  2017,10,View is somewhat lacking. however this area of boston would require the hotel to be at least 20 stories high to have a better view.,great location. booked penthouse suite for wife's birthday. had late lunch in the nearby north end of boston.checked into onyx . very nice lounge/ bar area. room was well appointed with granite and stainless steel wet bar/counter space. bath excellent. hotel is located 500 yards from td bank boston garden where we enjoyed an excellent concert. overall wonderful stay would definitely book again.

Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Barbara,United States of America,1 review,June 27  2017,9.2,Bathroom ventilation was poor. Mirrors fogged up so bad we had to wipe them off frequently.  Drain in sink was slow... iron didn't work.,Happy hour good. but should be until 700 vs 600. There were a cpl times when 600 was too early to join
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Tiffany,United States of America,1 review,June 26  2017,10,N/A,The bed was AMAZING! I quickly fell asleep each night. They have complimentary cold brew (and regular) coffee in the morning. The decorations were different. but really cool.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Edward,United Kingdom,1 review,June 23  2017,7.1,thought room was small. no coffee making in room although available at reception. no fridge as it is used for mini bar. expensive for what it is. guess need to recognise that it is a city centre location.

Kimpton Onyx Hotel,A. Ratford,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,May 27  2017,8.8,Shower was a little underpowered but still okay. Breakfast was underwhelming; small selection of warm food and a standard continental selection. However rather expensive for what was provided. would recommend eating elsewhere.,Close to Boston North Station with links to the MBTA and AMTRAK. in a great location close to lots of amenities. restaurants and drug stores. Room was a great size. the bed was a huge and very comfortable. TV was comfortable to watch from the bed. Bathroom was modern and clean

Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Lynne,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,April 25  2017,7.5,The underhand charges added to bill. We were told wi-if was included in our booking but were charged $15 + tax per day. When queried. told it wasn't for wi-fi. but a facility fee for - wi-fi(!). tea or coffee from a flask in reception and other mysterious things we did not avail of. 5 days after leaving. another $12+ was applied to my credit card which we were not invoiced for.,Staff were pleasant and helpful
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Janet,Canada,2 Reviews,April 12  2017,9.6,The room had a small window with a view of neighboring buildings. If a view is important to a traveler. this could be an issue. However. I spend much more time outside exploring rather than being in my hotel. so a nice view would be a bonus for me but not a must. The rooms are a little on the pricey side. but still pretty much standard for Boston hotels as far as I can determine.,This hotel is in a great location for anyone planning a trip to Boston with activities planned for TD Garden. the North End. the harbor and the Faneuil Hall Marketplace area. All those places are within easy walking distance.  The room was comfortable with nice amenities (loved the bathrobes) and the staff were very friendly and helpful.

Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Angela,Canada,1 review,April 6  2017,7.9,I was disappointed by this particular location.  It was clean and the internet was good and the staff was friendly. but I felt the overall atmosphere of the hotel was not up to the Kimpton standard.  I had breakfast at the hotel. which was quite literally in the lobby near the door. so every time someone went in or out. there was a huge gust of wind and we froze.,I try to stay exclusively at Kimpton hotels on my travels. I absolutely love them.  I find I have consistency excellent customer service. by far better than any other hotel chain.  I like that each property is unique and most are boutique-y feeling.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Laura,United States of America,1 review,March 31  2017,8.3,Room service was awful. It said available 24 hours butwhen i called to order at 1230 am they acted like they were trying to talk us out of ordering. they had 1 cook. another order before us. we'd have to wait more than an hour. They didnt get the order right and the food wasn't very good but we were hungry and ate it anyway. They charge A LOT extra for room service so it was weird to be treated like they didn't want to provide it.,Best part was the 2 min walk to TD Garden (and back) for our concert. And the room was really nice. and clean!
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Bill Zildjian,United States of America,15 Reviews,March 27  2017,10,I arrived just before a Boston Bruins game. so the traffic was tough to deal with at the time. Thank goodness for valet parking. as I could stop worrying about traffic at that point.,Location was supreme-- one block away from my next-morning appointment. It would also be good for anyone attending events at Boston Garden. Only a five-minute walk to the North End. which has hundreds of first-class restaurants close to each other.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Jessika,United States of America,6 Reviews,March 22  2017,7.5,Breakfast was terrible. only a few options. uncomfortable seating. quality of food was bad (it seems same food is presented a couple of days in a row which does not make it fresh),Staff was really friendly and helpful
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Caitlin,United States of America,2 Reviews,March 20  2017,10,The shower needed to have more water pressure and the bathroom floor was cold.,The bed was very comfortable. and the staff was great.

This would be the perfect hotel if you are going to the Garden for any reason.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Pierre,Haiti,1 review,March 18  2017,7.1,They weren't breakfast included and we paid a lot of money. At least they could give us breakfast,I really liked the way the staff treated us and the structure of the rooms. That's all
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Mikhail Martinez,United States of America,4 Reviews,March 12  2017,6.7,The room we stayed in had toe nails on the floor. It was a bit dusty in certain areas.,I liked that it was next to The TD Garden. Walking distance to many bars. Bathrooms were clean. Asked for extra towels and staff were quick to bring them.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,5 Reviews,March 10  2017,7.5,The restaurant was definitely overpriced and the food was not good at all!

Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Nancy,United States of America,2 Reviews,March 6  2017,7.1,The valet did not seem very organized. It took half hour for the valet to take our key and give us our ticket. The front desk actually had to intervene and take our key and room number it was taking so long. There were three dogs in the room across from us barking.  We complained twice and we're told the situation would be taken care of.  I don't know if the dogs were moved to a different room or not since we did not hear them after we went to bed  but it should not have taken two complaints for it to be handled.  Overall the trip was good just the inconvenience of the valet service and dogs barking put a damper on our family trip.,Location to td garden and resturants
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Amber,United States of America,1 review,March 3  2017,6.3,Fridge already stocked and price for things in it ridiculous ly priced.

Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Paige,United States of America,1 review,February 20  2017,10,N/A,Super friendly and welcoming staff! Love the fun atmosphere of the rooms and excellent shower! Easy location to North Station I would definitely recommend!! Thanks again!
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Colleen,United States of America,1 review,February 11  2017,10,Room service was horrible. We were there during a blizzard and we were hungry and ordered Mac and Cheese bites. ice cream. and sodas. This was over $50. While Mac and Cheese bites were NOT on the kids menu and were on the regular menu we were surprised that they were flat and shaped like dinosaurs and it was obvious they were frozen. not house made. Then to make it even worse they heavy handed salt on the top of them. They were served with a cup of what we thought was marinara and dipped one only to discover it was cold and tasted more like watered down ketchup than sauce. The soda was filled with ice to to rim and a drip of soda. And they tried to get fancy with the ice cream (which was a very small portion) and poured honey on it and sprinkled it with cinnamon. When  you want vanilla ice cream. you want vanilla ice cream not a melted bowl of honey with a bit of ice cream. Horrible. On checkout when asked how our stay was I said. "excellent other than room service" and laughed. They asked about the room service and I told them about the dinosaur shaped Mac and Cheese bites. You could tell he was embarrassed and he credited the room service bill.,This location is about half a block from the train station and the TD Garden which made it perfect for us as we were in town for a game and we took the train in. There are several restaurants within a couple blocks and it is a very quick walk to Quincy Market and Fanieul Hall. Our room was nicely appointed and clean. There were no in room coffee makers. but they had coffee in the lobby for a couple hours in the morning. They have a stocked mini bar in the room. which I am not a fan of. but we should have used that   after our experience with room service. The room was quiet and the staff very friendly. We will stay there again when in town for a game but will eat out rather then getting room service.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Lady911,United States of America,1 review,January 30  2017,5.8,The staff was kinda rude at times. the resteraunt was tiny and right as you walk in the door you practically walk into the dining area. The room was small but comfortable for two people. The room wasn't worth paying a lot of money.,The bed was perfect. but more pillows were needed.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Matt,United States of America,1 review,January 16  2017,10,Didn't realize the valet parking was going to be $50. but it is very convenient since there's not really any street side parking.,Rooms are very clean/spacious/comfortable Amenities are awesome. 24 hour menu is great. Mini bar is loaded. We stayed in a King Deluxe room. Complimentary wine hour and cocktail like lounge is was awesome. Breakfast was delicious the next day as well. We will be back again. I highly recommend this place.

Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,January 3  2017,8.8,Room service is overpriced in my opinion. and it was a smaller hotel in the sense I wouldn't have a family member stay there. but very nice for a group of young friends. Besides that no complaints!,Staff was wonderful. very festive for New Years. Large bathroom and mirror made it easy for four girls to shower and get ready in minimal time!
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Alberto,United States of America,4 Reviews,January 2  2017,9.6,Everything was great. only thing they can improve is Breakfast. Also The breakfast area was uncomfortably hot. due to being adjacent to the entrance. They put extra heat against cold air comes in every time some one uses the door.,I had my 80 yrs old mother with us. They greet us with our family name upon check in. They had a hand written greeting card. wine and cheese plate to welcome us in the each room. She was happy. Nice personal touch that Hiltons or Westins are start neglecting.Room was just as you seen in website. size is decent. super clean bath room with bathrobe. Valet park. or they will give you advice on alternatives. Staff are great. willing to  help you.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Diane,United States of America,1 review,December 31  2016,9.6,The bed was too soft but that is just a personal preference.,This hotel isn't big but the staff and what it offers will have you thinking otherwise! The added extras are fantasic and if there is something you don't have or forgot. no worries because the staff will actually go out and purchase it for you. The rooms are not huge but supply you with more than some of the other hotels do! You may spend a little extra but it is well worth it!
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Jessica,United States of America,1 review,December 29  2016,5.8,I did not like that when my husband puked in the room and I personally cleaned up and was charged more than one night's deposit. In fact was charged more than my night for my entire stay. Very upsetting. considering I attempted to pick up as much as I could.,N/A

Kimpton Onyx Hotel,WantageMichael,United Kingdom,16 Reviews,December 5  2016,7.9,No communal lounge or similar spaces. Minibar was confusing (and not properly checked before my stay),Very welcoming and accommodating staff. Attractive and comfortably furnished room and lobby area. Good WiFi.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,ya_shin,Taiwan,4 Reviews,November 24  2016,10,The room provided was a little dark. There was only a small window and the interior lighting seemed slightly insufficient.,The quality of of the hotel and its location are great. especially in relation to the pricing level.The beds were very comfortable.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Julie,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,November 1  2016,7.9,Cleanliness could have been improved. We stayed for 7 days and had clean towels but no clean bedding. We didn't have duvet covers but loose sheets over a well worn duvet. Thought this could have been much better considering price we payed and length of stay.,Overall location was excellent. Bed comfy.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Eric,Canada,1 review,October 27  2016,9.6,-room was a little small. Not your fault. Existing building in an old city,-the hotel was really nice-we liked the Boston pillows in the room-excellent service
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Lori,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 23  2016,10,N/A,The location of this hotel was an easy walk to the North End of Boston. The hotel lobby smelled lovely and there was fresh ice cold citrus water available. Between 5 to 6pm there was a wine reception. nice extra! The room and bathroom were sparkling clean and our room was ready an hour or so early.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Tansukh,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 17  2016,6.3,This is not a 4 star hotel and rooms are small. You are paying for location only. You are better off booking 2 or 3 miles away like Fenway or Harvard and travel in. Boston is a small town and journey would only take you 15 minutes.,Location
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Rosemary,United States of America,1 review,October 12  2016,8.3,I think the cost could have been more reasonable.  This is a no-frills. basic hotel albeit with comfortable bedrooms and bathrooms.,Breakfast was fine and the bed too.  Neither out of the ordinary or spectacular.  One has to realize that this hotel is really for the business person rather than the vacationer.  People come in and out. they don't tend to linger.  The front desk staff were very helpful.  I enjoyed the location as much of the historical parts of the city were reachable on foot.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Uk,United Kingdom,1 review,October 9  2016,4.2,Had to move rooms after first night due to continuous electrical equipment humming noise resonating through the room - which to be fair Sue was very apologetic and efficiently sorted next day. However a quick Google confirmed the same noise complaint dates back to at least 2006! Hotel is small and you could easily walk past it! It is located in litter strewn out-of-town location - certainly not in a tourist area - hotel would describe it a regeneration area. No coffee making facilities in room. but apparently you can loan a coffee making machine if you forgot to bring one with you - who travels with a coffee making machine?!! Snacks and bottled water available in room at ridiculous prices. e.g. $5 for a small (and i mean small) bottle of water. Given price paid  (over $400 a night) was expecting something centrally located and superior to the usual larger hotel chains - even breakfast was extra. To cap it all I was told I could only access the advertised free Wi-Fi if I signed up to the hotel rewards programme! First and last time I stay in a Kimpton,Sue
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Michael,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,September 30  2016,9.2,More space in reception. e.g. passing through with baggage when there is 1 or 2 others at the desk.,Comfortable bed. Immaculate cleaning.Quiet.Friendly helpful staff e.g. nearest massage clinic.Free helpful area map.Complimentary coffee and savoury (reception). Street view only but good location. with easy walk to Transit access. pastry shop!. Bar food. mini mkt.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Robert,United States of America,1 review,September 27  2016,5.4,Very small room for the price. Check in staff was very helpful. Check out service desk associate was very rude. Too many hotels in the city to deal with poor customer service. We won't be back.,The location
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Jenna,United States of America,4 Reviews,September 23  2016,8.8,The rooms were small. but a fair trade off for the location.,The service by the staff was excellent. I had leftovers from an amazing Italian dinner the night previous that i did NOT want to part with. When I asked for a fork to eat them cold they INSISTED they would warm them up and then even went to the lengths to bring it all out plated on room service trays. I couldn't have been more thankful.Also. only took us 10 minutes to get to Boston Logan from the hotel front door.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Jon,United Kingdom,1 review,September 18  2016,5.8,The hotel seemed expensive for the overall experience. There was building / loading / reversing (beeps) noise at night (even though we were on the 9th floor. Also rowdy noise until 2:30 one (game?) night. Head right from the door and you will probably meet panhandlers and people who may act quite alarmingly. Charging for any speed of wifi puts people off - well it does me. No other hotel on our trip does that.,Friendly and helpful staff. free newspapers and coffee.The breakfast worked well. The guy on the door was very helpful getting us a cab.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Frequent,United States of America,1 review,September 18  2016,8.3,Had issue with lights. clock but minor and staff took care of issue.,Free bikes. friendly check in and out. near TD Garden and close to other sites. Overall.  good hotel that was pricey but comparable to avg prices in Boston for the particular weekend.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Claire,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 15  2016,8.8,N/A,The hotel was within walking distance to 99% of the things we wanted to do and the T was also within walking distance and we could get everywhere! Porters is right next door! You would think they had  so so bar food.  No--- Best food ever!
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Martin,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 8  2016,10,Everything met our expectations.,Staff was very polite and helpful. The room was spacious and the bed was really comfortable. Bathroom was clean and spacious too. Very good location. close to both Cambridge and downtown.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Li,China,4 Reviews,September 4  2016,6.7,We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights. but only changed bed sheets one time as requested; and the staff didn't send back laundry on time.,The location is ok. close to subway station; The bed is quite comfortable.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Lauren,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 1  2016,6.7,Ice machine broken and shower wasn't amazing; but it worked fine. These are really minor complaints as everything else was good.,Check in staff very friendly - particularly as we had issues checking in. Beds amazingly comfortable and air con worked well. You can walk to dinner in the Northern area and get great Italian!
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Vincent,Ireland,6 Reviews,September 1  2016,9.2,Not much to dislike about this hotel . the price may be a little steep but that is because of all the state and local taxes. America ! what can you do but still worth it. The buffet breakfast $16 is a bit much if you only want cereal so the Quincy market is a better choice only six or seven minutes away with great choice and a lot cheaper.,Great Location walking distance to most tourist sights. Staff very helpful .wine and cheese reception every day half five till six and free bicycles to use. The Ruby restaurant in the hotel is very good and reasonable for dinner if you do not want to go out.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Ingrid,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,August 31  2016,6.7,The staff weren't very forthcoming with information and i had to keep asking them things that I would normally expect to be advised - ie. where's the crib i ordered. what time is check out. do you have a map. is there breakfast?,The bed was big and comfy.  The shower was great.  The location is great. walking distance to Quincy market and Italian district for food and views.  Downtown Boston is quite compact though so we were able to walk most of it with a baby anyway.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Debby,United States of America,1 review,August 30  2016,10,N/A,The room was large and clean and the shower was amazing.  Location is excellent for getting around Boston. either on foot or using the T.  Staff was friendly and helpful.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Ricardo,United States of America,1 review,August 24  2016,8.3,There was an issue with the room I originally booked no one seemed to know about until we complained. the AC was not working. this was one of the top floor penthouses but since there were no other ones available we had to be downgraded. not ideal. The manager did however slash the price in half because of the inconvenience and got us free ice cream. Thumbs up for the helpful staff. I simply expected more when ordering a premium room. like for someone to make sure rooms are ready at the very least the morning of the scheduled booking.,The rooms were very well decorated and clean. the bed was really comfortable. the view was okay.
Kimpton Onyx Hotel,Jamie,United States of America,1 review,August 23  2016,8.3,The hotel was really expensive. and it would have been nice if breakfast was complimentary. And the front desk should tell you how to access the free wifi. I had to call down to the front desk once in my room because we were given no directions.,I liked the free wifi. the location. and the room was cute with the animal print bath robes and a funny "wicked smaht" pillow. I wish the breakfast was included. but the egg and sausage burrito with home fries was still delicious!
One-Bedroom on Beacon Street Apt 204,Stan,United States of America,8 Reviews,July 27  2017,10,Nothing!  It was great!  Many fine stores within the block. Whole Foods. restaurants etc.  New designer deli about to open in the next few months directly below the apt. Very spacious. quiet. and clean apt.  Nice to have new laundry facilities inside the apt too,Everything was very simple according to the detailed instructions provided by very responsive and kind reps from the Sonder company.  Excellent new essentially 2 br apartment if you add in the Den in good location.  Not downtown but very easy to get around in Boston which is a small city in terms of downtown areas (walking town and easy T connection .
One-Bedroom on Beacon Street Apt 204,Emma,Australia,4 Reviews,April 20  2017,8.3,The blinds don't block out the street light so it's quite bright at night in the main bedroom &amp; would be too if anyone was sleeping on the sofa bed.,They accomodated a slightly early check in so we could make it to our afternoon baseball game at Fenway Park. The beds were super comfortable.

Studio on Arch Street Apt 2E,Elizabeth,United States of America,1 review,October 22  2017,7.5,There are stairs to each floor. To reach the elevator you need to go downstairs to the basement to find the elevator. I just got my cast off a broken foot and it made it a little more difficult to manage the steps with a suitcase.,It was in a good location. A grocery store was near by and convenient. A 10 minute walk to the Hop On Hop Off bus route. Close to the Theatre District and China Town.
Studio on Arch Street Apt 2E,Katarina,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 21  2017,9.6,I didn't miss anything,I was really surprised. The studio is well equipped and absolutely comfortable. Maybe not suitable for people who want a lot of sunshine in the room. I had a problem with television channels for news but survived using my iPad. It is absolutely fine for travelers who leave after breakfast a come back for dinner. Or after dinner as me. I loved it.
Studio on Arch Street Apt 2E,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,July 31  2017,7.5,Accessing it with the stairs was annoying when moving luggage in,Convenient location and good price

One-Bedroom on Arch Street Apt 2D,Carol,Australia,13 Reviews,July 13  2017,9.0,A bedside table and a lamp in the bedroom would have been good. There was nowhere in the bedroom at the right height to put some things beside the bed.,The location. the amenities. the comfortable bed. the ease of entering and leaving the building. The apartment was central to so many places we wanted to visit and was close to shops. supermarkets and the underground T system.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 28  2017,10,They really didn't have the internet as accessible as I liked. I really wanted fresh coffee but received no accommodations and had ordered it in the morning never got it.,Nice room. And clean. Friendly staff
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 22  2017,5.4,No free Wifi. You gotta be a reward member to have access to wifi for free. Or else. they will charge you 12 USD per day. No toothbrush among daily toiletries provided. You will need to call front desk to get one.,Informative and helpful staff.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Molly,United States of America,1 review,October 18  2017,7.1,The business center was extremely sparse...no pens. no ability to fax. The restaurant bartenders were not at all friendly and food was OK.,All staff in actual hotel was very helpful and kind. Beds were great.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Margaret,Canada,1 review,October 16  2017,9.6,The parking wasn't included in the booking and was very expensive at $48 per night.We didn't try breakfast as again it wasn't included and for $25 we could eat somewhere different with a range of menu items.,Very convenient location steps away from Fisherman's wharf.The beds were superbly comfortable but too high off the ground for shorter individuals.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Cortland,United States of America,1 review,September 28  2017,2.9,I ended up sleeping on a big cot in a hospitality room because my room was given away and the rooms had roaches... as well as being woken up too early by housekeeping the next morning!,Nothing
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Marcelo,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,September 21  2017,9.6,Fairly standard look of a big chain. don't expect a memorable experience.,Quick 20 minute taxi from airport. very convenient for the ferry and access to lots of new restaurants and bars. Also walkable to downtown Boston ~ 25min. Decent size gym facilities and big lobby bar for drinks.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 7  2017,9.2,Wifi was not free. Was not allowed to bring outside alcohol into the hotel. Jacuzzi was broken so we were unable to get in. Staff didn't seem like they new what they were doing 100% of the time.,Clean and updated room. Great view. Within walking distance from restaurants and activities. Close enough to the city.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Randi,Canada,1 review,September 3  2017,2.9,Booking.com did a terrible of conveying what this property is like. Parking is $48 not $44 as you promised under guest details and the manager argued with me about it. claiming you're a third party website so the hotel has no obligation to honour anything you say. Booking.com gave me no option to use reward points fromMarriott. This hotel is very far from downtown. It's huge and impersonal with substandard service. The plugs in the room were loose. the water temperature design is backward. the pillows were hard. and all morning starting at 5am there were planes roaring overhead from the nearby airport. one after the other. I didn't notice I had booked a non refundable reservation on booking.com and I'll never make that mistake again. Better to book through hotel websites.,Starbucks in the building.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Kristina,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 29  2017,9.6,More time in Boston,Location great...near some wonderful restaurants.  Near the cruise terminal...walkable if few bags...easy quick ride on Uber or taxi.   We used Uber to get into the main area of Boston tourist land.   Too far to walk when time is of the essence.   Room was great  lovely view.  Starbucks on property. Did not use the hotel facilities...but clearly popular for weddings and parties.  NOT noisy though.   Expensive but so are other Boston hotels.

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Maryjo,United States of America,1 review,July 22  2017,9.2,It did say on our reservation that there was a complimentary breakfast and we didn't get it. The person at desk said it was because we didn't make reservation with hotel! There were 2 weddings that weekend so that probably added to the problem. There would have been an hour wait if we wanted to pay for the breakfast. so we just went somewhere else. Wasn't enough of a problem to mar our good time!,The room was beautiful! The bed was very comfortable!  Enjoyed the bar with its excellent drinks and delicious appetizers.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Raymind,United States of America,1 review,July 10  2017,10,The view could have been more appealing.  Most of the room faced another building and the gardens below were pretty poorly taken care of.,I liked that the hotel was easy to get to and from the highway.  The staff was really friendly and professional.

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Carrie,United States of America,1 review,June 12  2017,6.7,Very expensive. For the amount you pay for the room. parking and breakfast should be complimentary. It wasn't worth the 350.00 a night I paid. We didn't even get our room cleaned because thy came so late in the morning it was already my 2 year olds nap time. They didn't try to clean it until noon. we left all morning. they had plenty of time to clean it.    The pool was sooo small and it was freezing. although indoors.,N/A

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Susan,Jersey,3 Reviews,May 30  2017,7.1,It was a very long walk to the hub. for us we would have been better in a more central location.,Very Convenient for the airport and railway station.

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Stuart,Australia,2 Reviews,April 17  2017,7.9,N/A,It is close (i.e. next to) some excellent restaurants (such as Legal Seafood). It is also a convenient location to reach the downtown area. A good business class hotel.

Problems at the start with refrigerator in the room it did not work. Had to get it fixed. Ice machine on our floor was not working. Had to get that fixed. Key cards did not work easily. Had to change out and still took several times to open the door.  Should at least have some comp water and coffee In the lobby. This was a pricey place and amenities were not up to par.,Beautiful place.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Jonathan,United States of America,1 review,February 27  2017,9.2,We received two noise complaints for a loud TV. We are musicians and somewhat hard of hearing because of it. Sorry but. security was not necessary.-Cheers!,We asked for a cardboard cutout of Ziggy Stardust to keep us company in our room during our stay.It was obviously an unreasonable request but. on our last day the staff slipped a thank-you note under the door with David Bowie prominently displayed. It was beautiful.Thank you.-LEIKO
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Charles,Ireland,2 Reviews,February 25  2017,10,The Internet  should be free in rooms to all guests and not at the price that was asked for . After all it is a great hotel and the staying  prices show that . but a major  let down to have to pay more for Internet  access  in rooms .,Staff when out of they way to help .
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Andrew,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,February 1  2017,7.9,Didn't enjoy paying $4 for water bottles left in my room.  Assumed they were complimentary so it wasn't a pleasant surprise when I got my bill at the end of my three weeks' stay. I found the bar a little draughty as well. The itemised charging for laundry e.g. $3 for a single pair of socks forced me to go external for my laundry.,Breakfast was always enjoyable. good food and good. friendly service and with gluten free toast! Friendly and informative service at the bar in the evenings as well with the NFL play-off games on screen. The Business Centre was useful on a couple of occasions. Always good to have an ironing board and iron in the room. My bed was very comfortable. The WiFi was reliable.

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Lisa,United States of America,1 review,January 1  2017,10,I called twice a few days before check-in to ask about possibly checking in an hour early. The staff who answered the phone was quick to answer my question but also just as quick to hang up the phone before asking me if I had any other questions.,The front desk staff was very friendly and informative. The room was very clean and comfortable.

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Katherine,United States of America,2 Reviews,November 24  2016,7.5,They charge for the water in the room (very deceiving) and the Internet. The bathroom was clean...but the bathtub looked old.,The location was great; front desk staff was friendly enough. nothing memorable. The front desk agent I dealt with during check out was much more cheerful and inviting than the agent I dealt with when I arrived. There was a Starbucks right downstairs and I loved the texting feature to get your car ready when you valet. The room was a good size and was up to date.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Maria,Portugal,3 Reviews,October 1  2016,9.6,It's an expensive hotel... but the price seems to be the normal for Boston.,The location is excellent if you are going to the Boston Convention Center. just a five minutes walk.

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Jillian,United Kingdom,1 review,September 7  2016,6.7,Internet access in rooms for $12.75 a day is a blatant rip off. Why do some hotel chains think this is ok? - others pride themselves on free internet (e.g. Radisson). The hotel pay for wifi regardless of the number of guests who use it.,Good location for the airport and good facilities. except rip-off wifi.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Walter,United States of America,1 review,September 6  2016,2.9,The room they gave us had doors that didn't lock and we were late for our dinner reservation because they gave no urgency to fixing the issue. The telephones in our room weren't hooked up. so we had to keep going down to the front desk to ask for updates. The staff was unhelpful and acted like we were asking for too much when we reported the unlocked door issue. They moved us to another room where shower door didn't have any sort of lining under it to prevent water from leaking all over the bathroom floor. We had to use all of the towels to dry the floor each day. This was all after my initial booking. where they charged us three times in different amounts. and had to reverse some of the charges. My credit card company actually disabled my card afterwards because they thought it was fraudulent activity. Nothing went right from booking all the way through checkout. Poor staff service. confused finance department. and I don't think the building/rooms were well constructed. Too many issues for a short stay.

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Jessica,Canada,11 Reviews,August 31  2016,8.3,Was told free wifi but stuck with the charge after I get home and check credit card. Was ripped off by conceigure desk. Be careful what you are buying or paying for.,Beautiful hotel and Starbucks located downstairs. Check in lady at front desk was super nice and gave a very positive and welcoming  feeling. I think her name was Emily.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Cassandra,United States of America,1 review,August 17  2016,10,There was a limited choices of what to eat for lunch and dinner at the hotel if you didn't like seafood. that being said there were plenty of close restaurants.,It was a central location with a beautiful view of the harbor.  Also the rooms were beautiful with some good choices in decor to make you feel comfortable.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Kevin,United States of America,1 review,August 15  2016,10,There really wasn't anything. Great location near all the restaurants and Sapore was great. We had dinner and drinks there.,The bed and pillows were the best. Great night sleep. I went online and ordered the pillows.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Patrick,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 14  2016,5.8,Bed sheets were not fresh. Very disappointing. And we had no view of the city. as I had requested a room on the highest level possible,The location at the seaport
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Anonymous,Italy,5 Reviews,August 12  2016,8.3,I had to join the Marriot Club to get free wifi.  Today wifi should be free to all guests.  There is no excuse to charge for wifi.  Parking in Boston is a total rip-off.  There must be a way for the hotel to negotiate better prices for its guests.,Location was perfect for our needs and staff were extremely friendly.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Samantha,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 31  2016,6.7,We were low on time for an event in Boston. The check in line was very long. between 5-8 you should have more staff out front. Also the water pressure was super low and valet took more than 20 minutes with no benches out front.,Location
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Jeff,United States of America,4 Reviews,June 23  2016,7.5,I never liked any of the music playing in the foyer or bar area and it was everywhere. If you wanted to place a cell call you had to go outside. Also. there was an exit door near the bar that would sound an alarm everytime someone went out the door when the bar was open. Totally destroying any atmosphere.,Breakfast menu was very good.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Deborah,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 23  2016,7.9,We would have liked to have a safe in the room and refrigerator snacks etc.,The location was super and very exciting to see the development of that area of Boston.The staff was very friendly.

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Denise,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 6  2016,10,Took a long time to get our car from valet.

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Erin,United States of America,3 Reviews,May 31  2016,7.5,Found it odd that you're not allowed to bring in outside beer or wine - just wanted to relax in my room with a couple of beers but was told I could not bring them into the hotel. Would not stay here again because of that. Maybe a zoning law or something (i.e. not the fault of the hotel) - but is a deal breaker.,Location is excellent.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Kate_NYC,United States of America,11 Reviews,May 25  2016,6.7,The beds were very narrow. they didn't even seem to be a full size double bed. Pool was nice to have but could use a little sprucing up. The location is good if you're spending a lot of time in the seaport area. but otherwise it's a bit of a walk to downtown Boston.,Very close to my conference at the Seaport World Trade Center.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,May 24  2016,6.7,I was pretty disappointed with our room. The view from our room and the room itself was nothing special considering how much I paid for a one-night stay.,N/A

Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,David,United States of America,1 review,April 26  2016,9.2,I called for sheets for the bed in the pull out couch. The woman on the phone asked specifically if I needed the fitted sheet for the bed then there was no fitted sheet delivered to the room. Housekeeping staff continued to make the bed that way never adding a fitted sheet.,The staff at the front desk was fantastic. I was paying in cash for the weekend and it took almost the whole team to put their heads together and figure it out but we figured it all out and they were pleasant and courteous the entire time. It was a great experience.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,William,Canada,5 Reviews,April 23  2016,8.8,High cost relative to other similar hotels that we have stayed in. This was because of the Boston Maraton weekend and all prices were high. No free wi fi in rooms. $18.00 per day is outrageous.,Beds were very comfortable wth nicely furnished. spacious and clean rooms Nice views from hotel room window and short walk to historic area. Friendly and helpful staff. Close to the airport with a free shuttle.
Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel,Laura,United States of America,1 review,March 2  2016,9.2,Had to pay for wifi 12.95 plus tax a day then added a 4doller charge on top of that without  my approval .SB- coffee shop closes early . parking was out rated over 30 a day.

Luxury Stay Boston Boylston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,10 Reviews,October 22  2017,8.8,This was the 4th self-catering unit we stayed in on our holiday in New England. Like the others. this seems to assume that you'll eat out or buy takeaways a lot. There is a full kitchen but only crockery for four [one mug chipped]. so you're always washing up or setting the dishwasher. We added more mugs. kitchen scissors and a bottle/can opener.,Good value apartment for a week-long stay. About two miles from the very centre of town but easy access via Fenway T station. Supermarkets. restaurants and fast food outlets within steps of the apartment block. Secure concierge access. Equally convenient for Red Sox fans or art lovers. the Boston MFA is visible from the apartment window.
Luxury Stay Boston Boylston,Hazel,United States of America,1 review,September 28  2017,10,N/A,The unit was spotless and the view was beautiful.  I could see an expanse of the Avenue of the Arts with the Museum of Fine Arts to my left and Longwood Medical with Harvard Medical School to my right.  The unit is spacious and comfortable.  The family felt right at home.  The area is jam packed with activities - between Fenway Park to the Regal movie theater and so much more.  And don't get me started on the food.  So many choices. so little time.  Shopping?  Target and Sephora across the street.  Want to go somewhere else?  Public transportation around the corner to take you to Newbury Street and the Prudential Center.  I love that the staff like Jeff and Doug are so helpful and courteous as well.
Luxury Stay Boston Boylston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 23  2017,10,A few extra blankets and towels would have been great. but that's really being very picky.,Spacious apartment and great location

One-Bedroom on N Margin Street Apt 1,Michelle,South Africa,3 Reviews,October 6  2017,9.6,N/A,A surprisingly comfortable and well-equipped apartment for the price. with a very comfortable bed.  I'd highly recommend staying here as the location is excellent for the North End. famous restaurants and shops are a few metres away and the subway is also within easy walking distance.  It's on the ground floor. which is helpful for those of us travelling with big bags!  And I really appreciated the very nice filter coffee that was provided.The booking agency for this apartment is Sonder (sonder.com) and I had the most fantastic service experience from them; they were so quick to get back to me and really helpful. to the extent of making arrangements for me to conveniently collect an item I'd left behind when I checked out.  I would highly recommend using them.
One-Bedroom on N Margin Street Apt 1,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,June 27  2017,7.9,More secure locks on door to outside in the bedroom.  Curtain needs to be put on that door.,Arrangement of furniture. closets. and space perfect for more than 2 people.  Response to clogged tub was to send someone over to repair quickly.
Beacon Hill Hotel,Noemi,United States of America,21 Reviews,October 4  2017,9.2,The first room we were given had no desk and was cramped.

Beacon Hill Hotel,Anonymous,United States of America,4 Reviews,September 10  2017,10,There were only things to appreciate and applaud.,The Hotel is both physically beautiful and charming...and it is human scale.

Beacon Hill Hotel,Barbara Ducam-Davies,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,July 22  2017,4.5,Lighting. comfortable bath facilities  and more space for the price paid.,For the price . i could have had a better and more spacious room in another four star hotel. but I wanted to experience a boutique hotel in Beacon Hill. The premises need a serious refurbishment and more contemporary look . Also the place does not seem to be well maintained It is a real pity given the excellent location. there was no shower cap. the bath tub was really old style since the 60's and it seems that management is tight on investing money into a better hotel ( toiletries and one bottle of mineral water)
Beacon Hill Hotel,Carolina,Argentina,3 Reviews,July 19  2017,8.3,The room was extremely small and it lacked of basic accomodations as having room to fit our luggage and poor lighting.,The staff was exta polite. The bed sheets and towels were of premium quality. The room was very clean.

Beacon Hill Hotel,Rosalind,United States of America,1 review,March 28  2017,10,It would be nice to have restrooms on the lobby floor. but the first floor is charming and there isn't enough room from what we could see.,The hotel was very friendly and helpful.  They made us feel very welcome.
Beacon Hill Hotel,Jamie,United States of America,2 Reviews,January 17  2017,6.7,No coffee in the room. Hot water issues.,Good location for a boutique hotel. Would have preferred staying at a different hotel closer to the freedim trail. Great staff and the breakfast was awesome. Did not like having to ask for coffee in the morning to sip on in our room. There was hot water issues in our room especially the first night. The manager did say we could bathe upstairs but really an inconveinience late at night. Rooms are small and as some other reviewers we had some noise issues really bad the last day.

Beacon Hill Hotel,Susan,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 22  2016,10,N/A,This is a wonderful hotel - and in a perfect location.  The staff was way beyond helpful - like being with family members.  And the Bistro was fabulous - great food. wine and staff.  Charles Street is a wonderful area to explore and the perfect site to explore from is the Beacon Hill Hotel and Bistro!
Beacon Hill Hotel,Giles,United Kingdom,1 review,September 1  2016,7.9,The decor of the rooms is very old fashioned and typical of the 1980s without having either having period authenticity or modernity. The decor caters for the old which will progressively put younger guests off.The breakfasts were OK but neither overly generous nor luxurious as claimed. There should be a lot more fruit and I personally would prefer a degree of self service,The grounds and the walks were wonderful. Our suite was  generous and spacious. One of the best features was being able to make tea in the sunroom at any time of the day.
Beacon Hill Hotel,Robert,United States of America,1 review,July 12  2016,8.3,The room was small but workable. but the desk/work cubby was tiny.  If you have to spread out some work papers. it's tough.,Location is just off Boston Common. great for walking all over the city. Little shops and restaurants all around.  And your own Bistro on the 1st floor! Bed was very comfortable
Beacon Hill Hotel,Jd,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 11  2016,9.2,Wifi did not work in my room.....,Lovely. small. well-situated hotel across from the Boston Common. close to everything.  Terrace on the 3rd floor was a fantastic place to read and sip a drink.

Beacon Hill Hotel,Ellen,United States of America,1 review,May 6  2016,9.6,Very bright street light outside the windows of my room.  Shutters on windows while attractive did not keep the light out. Had reserved a room with a queen.  Got put in a larger room with "king" bed that was actually 2 twins placed together -- so you have that break in the mattress in the middle.,Great location on Charles Street;  much better rate than larger / chain hotels in downtown area.  Staff very friendly &amp; welcoming.  Hotel is nicely renovated and refined in style.  Bar was cozy and relaxed. I ate at the bar rather than in the restaurant. Food was very good.  All the amenities (iron. hair dryer. shampoos &amp; lotions. etc) in the room that I needed.
Beacon Hill Hotel,Anonymous,Netherlands,4 Reviews,April 26  2016,7.9,Breakfast was ok except for the coffee. The beds weresome somewhat hard.Hotels in Boston are very expensive. especially if you'd choose for a great location like Beacon Hill,Location is perfect!
Beacon Hill Hotel,Maureen,United States of America,1 review,April 21  2016,10,N/A,BHH&amp;B's Charles Street location is so cool and convenient to all that we enjoy! We ran across the street for late afternoon flatbreads at Figs. We changed and headed out to a night of movies and gala for the Boston Int'l Film Festival and it was all so exciting and fun operating from this boutique hotel. The staff was so complimentary which added to the fun.

Beacon Hill Hotel,Cecilia,United States of America,1 review,March 21  2016,10,N/A,From the moment we checked in until the next morning as we left. Beacon Hill Bistro and Hotel staff and management treated us like family. We had a charming room with a great view. comfy bed. and direct access to the elevator. We couldn't have found a better place to stay in the quaint district of Beacon Hill. especially on Saint Patrick's Day. The hotel bar was the place to be. meeting amazing locals and finding new friends. The next morning we topped off a wonderful stay with a delicious breakfast and the tastiest coffee you can find. We can't wait to come back.Stop looking and start booking your next trip here!!!

Beacon Hill Hotel,Naomi,United States of America,1 review,January 7  2016,9.6,N/A,I love this hotel. perfect location.quaint without being dowdy.  Much more personality than a typical high end hotel but without the invasive quality of many small Inns.  The restaurant was great for dinner and complementary breakfast was best I've ever had - actually  a real value.The staff was friendly  and accommodating.  Room was on the smaller size but very clean. with very tasteful/elegant decor. Its a classic old building in a historic neighborhood - and it feels it - so if you're seeking authentic historic Boston and charm you've got it but if your priority is big generic space this isn't for you.

Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Downtown Seaport,Skye,United States of America,1 review,May 31  2017,5.8,Booking.com had a smoking preference option. Obviously I know it's never guaranteed based on time of arrival and what's available. But right on my confirmation it said smoking. When I got there the whole hotel was strict non smoking. I figured it out but that was frustrating. Also. although I selected my payment option would be cash when I got there. I couldn't check in because I needed a card. Well all I had was cash so I got lost for almost 2 hours in a new city to go to a CVS 1 minute away in order to put my cash on a prepaid money card so I could check in. I missed my dinner reservations because when I arrived it wasn't even 7 and by the time I was in my room it was 930. I had mixed feelings about the whole stay.,N/A
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Downtown Seaport,Barbara,United States of America,6 Reviews,May 29  2017,9.6,Window view looked upon a parking garage and alley but it was very quiet which was good.,Spacious accommodations-was nice having 2 tvs. Liked the big walkin shower.

Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Downtown Seaport,Brenda,United States of America,1 review,May 27  2017,10,Nothing bad to say,I can't say enough about this hotel!! My 16 year old daughter and I stayed here while we were in Boston and we absolutely loved this hotel. The staff was amazing and helpful and the hotel itself is absolutely beautiful!!! Wish we would've stayed another night.  There is a lot of amazing sites very close as well. The Boston Tea party and children's museum only blocks away. Several coffee shops and restaurants close by. And shopping not far either.

Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Downtown Seaport,Robert,United States of America,1 review,March 28  2017,6.3,Walls are thin. they had a couple in room next to us with a small baby that cried all night. We did not sleep at all. I called the front desk finally at 4:00am to complain and the only thing they did was apologize. The next morning when checking out I mentioned again about the disturbance. they said yes I have it on record that you called but again only apologized. We paid good money for a room that we could not sleep in. I asked why they would put a couple with a young baby next to just a couple and they could not answer that. These are reasons why staff rating is so low.,The renovation of the old mill was fantastic beauty job. room was spacious and comfortable. Free breakfast was ok.
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Downtown Seaport,Sarah,United States of America,1 review,January 10  2017,10,Parking is very expensive.,The hotel was unlike any I have stayed in before.

Housekeeping had temperature on "frigid" when we arrived. but I like to sleep when it's cold.,Stayed for 2 nights to watch Red Sox at Fenway Park.  Location close to airport and walking distance to downtown historical attractions.  Took free bus to Court Street Station and walked the short distance to hotel.

DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Martyn,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,November 1  2017,6.7,Following the hotels instructions we rang for their shuttle to pick us up from the airport. 3 phone calls and almost 2 hours later we were picked up. Took 20 minutes to check in as only 2 staff members on reception. plenty of guests in queue and they also had to answer both external and room service phone lines plus book shuttles and taxis as well. The staff did apologise which was nice. When we asked to book shuttle to cruise port for the following day only 1 timeslot left. Shuttle may be complimentary but it was far from a smooth process and I would not use this hotel again as this was one of the main reasons we selected it.,Comfortable and quiet room.

DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Victoria,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,October 22  2017,5.4,The Breakfast which cost $16 + tax was absolutely rotten. The baked goods were stale and hot food was poor quality with hardly any choice. We were spoiled at the other hotel we stayed in (Hampton Inn Boston Logan Airport) which had a free breakfast and was amazingly good. If we were to give that breakfast 10/10 we would this one 1/10. The beds were the smallest double beds of any hotel we have ever stayed in (very comfortable though),The shuttle bus driver was super friendly and informative. it was easy to be picked up at the airport using the Freephone facility. The bus would drop off at local restaurant's. The T station was a 5 min walk away. The waitress at breakfast was also very nice. A pleasant area next to the university.

When we got to the room it was not. so we called the front desk.  At first she said there were no rooms available on floors 5 or 6.  After telling her it did not matter if it was a king bed or 2 doubles. she said she had a room.  We moved to room 610 and when we opened the door there was a smell.  There was a huge wet spot in the carpet (about 3' by 3'). Moved to room #3 which was awesome! The M.O.D. was great.

DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Sboyer,United States of America,1 review,September 24  2017,7.5,On our last morning we had breakfast in the dining room. It was not laid out very well. In fact we didn't even know if we were in the right place to eat. All of the food was stone cold &amp; we had to pay $30 for a meal that should've cost less than $15. Having to pay for a continental breakfast in the first place is just wrong. Especially one that was as untasty as the one we had. And we also had to pay for parking which we've never had to do. When you pay $264 a night. you should get free parking! One night we arrived back to the hotel late &amp; weren't able to find a parking spot in the lot. We ended up getting lucky. after circling the lot for a few minutes that someone left. opening up a spot for us. If you're going to make us pay for parking. which is ridiculous...have enough spots!,Rooms were clean &amp; comfortable. Staff was friendly. We arrived 1 hour early &amp; the manager on duty allowed us to check in early.

DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Anonymous,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,September 6  2017,2.5,It is far from the centre and travelling by public transport leaves you walking in the dark under bridges and into empty parking lots. The hotel is surrounded by 3 empty university and business parking lots whicj ate rathwr spooky at night. The hotel staff was not trying to help you. The Wi-Fi is flaky and breakfast area ( which I paid a lot for 2 nights single occupancy. breakfast and coffee is extra) is rather looking like a fast food joint and untidy.,The room was big and the bed was large for a single person

DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Caitlin,United States of America,5 Reviews,August 30  2017,6.3,They snuck an extra 100 dollar charge onto my bill because they 'forgot' I had a discounted rate for Sunday. My account was overdrawn and when I told them that now I had no cash and was stuck in boston. they told me there was nothing they could do and that my refund would be issued in three days. Really? You're going to charge me 'accidentally' and that's the best you can do? Luckily my bank was able to reverse it ASAP.,Bed was comfortable and the cookies were tasty.
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Josephine,United Kingdom,1 review,August 30  2017,8.3,It was a little complicated to get to/from the airport as an international customer I didn't call to arrange the shuttle after I landed as my phone wasn't fully functional so got a taxi. but on the way back realised how easy the public transport system was. The only downside was the air con didn't have an off switch (or instructions). and kept clicking on/off loudly.,The location was brilliant. a 2 minute walk from the bay and 3 minutes to the train station the other way. Felt very safe in the area. The bed was comfortable.

DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Allison,United States of America,1 review,July 22  2017,7.9,The wifi was really bad. It kept cutting out every few minutes. I didn't like the lack of a continental breakfast or the fact that the hotel cafe was grossly overpriced. It wasn't until the last day of our trip that a staff member told us there was a grocery store within walking distance that was much cheaper. They suggested that the hotel didn't want them telling guests they had other options to buy quick meals without going all the way into the city.,The hotel was a good deal compared to other place more centrally located. because it was close to a subway stop and urban beach but didn't break the bank.

Breakfast was exspensive at the hotel.  Perhaps a light continental option would be nice for less money or even for free.,Staff was super freindly and helpful.  Facility was very nice.  Very close to the "T" subway system.
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Rebecca,United States of America,1 review,June 8  2017,7.9,No restaurants or other amenities in the area.Expensive breakfast.,Shuttle to the aquarium.There was a delay in the airport shuttle getting to the airport. so the hotel said they would reimburse us for the cab.
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Juliana,Canada,5 Reviews,June 1  2017,9.2,I was sad to see the dining facilities were limited but the food available was good.  The catering staff were excellent.,Good shuttle service. good staff.
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Hannah,United Kingdom,22 Reviews,June 1  2017,8.3,It's a couple of miles into town that isn't safe to walk. There is a safe train you can take however very nearby. Used the cafe once. was rather expensive and not great.,Lovely big. clean room and comfortable bed. Luxury bathroom. soft towels. Nice coffee in room. The cookies on arrival - yum!
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Andrea,United States of America,1 review,June 1  2017,7.5,Didn't expect the shower to just be the floor. So everything was wet. Hair dryer didn't work. Not a lot of towels. Only one normal sugar packet with the coffee maker,Room was nice
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Stephen,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 31  2017,4.6,No refrigerator or microwave in room.  Having to pay $15.00 per day to park and then having to park farther away from the building than if using public parking.  Having to sign up for a rewards program in order to avoid a $10.00 per day wifi access fee.,Easy access to major roadways and rapid transit.  Close to City of Boston attractions.
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Laura,United States of America,1 review,May 29  2017,3.3,Said there was free breakfast and it wasn't. It was $16 a person for crap food. Also toilet clogged twice long with my brothers and the shower kept clogging so was in over ankle deep water and after coming back from out and about was still standing water. Lastly put a preahthorization on my card for $530 for a $400 stay and was not notified this could happen so had no money to drive home. Funny how they didn't do that with my brothers card though? Tried to call hotel and actual corporate and they did not care and kept cutting me off in conversations,Bed was nice
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Melanie,United States of America,1 review,May 23  2017,7.9,The room was slightly dirty and there were holes in the sheets and pillowcases.,The hotel was really nice and had an awesome little food store that was open pretty late with a lot of food options. although some items were a little pricey. It was fantastic that there were Starbucks beverages available. They were scrumptious!
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Margy,United States of America,1 review,May 20  2017,9.2,N/A,The staff was welcoming and polite and the rooms were super clean. which was so awesome!  Cookies at the front desk were a nice touch!  Might offer some without nuts. as I'm allergic and would have loved a nut free chocolate chip cookie!  :). Overall a great experience and I would definitely recommend your hotel to friends and family!  Thank you!
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Phyllis,United States of America,1 review,May 8  2017,10,The only  onsite food available was Starbucks.  Disappointing,Every member of the staff. regardless of position. was warm. friendly. knowledgeable and helpful.  We corresponded on line prior to the trip and they promptly answered all my concerns. The convenience of the shuttle was impossible to measure.  They drove us and picked us up everywhere; the airport. Quincy Market and a local restaurant that wasn't on their regular route.  If it wasn't. already. some of the the best customer service I have ever had. the complimentary cookie... omg!
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Eleni,United States of America,1 review,April 24  2017,8.8,The rooms and hallways were very warm so we had to use the air conditioner which was too loud and kept waking us up went it went on :(,Bed was comfy. room was clean and spacious. bathroom nice. Overall good.
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,April 17  2017,7.5,The parking fee is too high ($12per night). There should be free parking. There isn't many variety of food for the breakfast buffet. The ice-cold towels in the gym smell weird. The overall price is too high. I don't think it worth it.,People worked there were very friendly to us. they even gave us free cookies when we were checking in. The gym was really nice!
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Terrence,United States of America,1 review,April 11  2017,6.3,For $200 a night plus paying to park overnight plus a cafe with items for purchase. I would expect to not be able to clearly hear my neighbors in the rooms next door. Staff was wonderful!!Facility itself could use some upgrades,N/A
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Melody,United States of America,1 review,March 22  2017,4.6,My first night my neighbor cooked fish in his room.  They removed the fish and cooking utensils but when I called downstairs to complain about the smell (it lasted all through the night). I was told they had to open his bathroom vents to air out his room and that for me to expect it to come to my room!  They would not move me....but rather moved him!  Will not stay there again and very disappointed.,Very nice bed.  Slept very well.
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Ryan,United States of America,1 review,March 17  2017,9.6,No refrigerator in room.  Every decent hotel has a fridge in the room.   Breakfast available for PURCHASE only.,Very comfortable beds.  Spacious and clean.  Well appointed bathroom.
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Sara,United States of America,1 review,March 14  2017,10,I wish it had stores and restaurants within waking distance but I guess that helped the price and it really wasn't far.,Great experience all around!  Easy to find.
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Charly,United States of America,1 review,March 3  2017,4.6,The  white lady who seemed to be from Germany. idk. was pretty rude and unhelpful. The location suckeddddd. the view was horrible.. I was kinda sad there was no pool or hot tub. The room was small and bed was NOT that comfortable.this place is probably better if your only coming here for business.. except you have to pay for wifi..and I remember the vending machine for water was EXPENSIVE like wth.,The room was clean and the fixtures where on the nicer side. And I got a cookie at the end . the foood was good but WAY to expensive.
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Joanie,United States of America,1 review,February 28  2017,8.3,Wished there had been a pool and a complimentary breakfast. And paying for parking at the hotel stinks!!,Very comfortable bedding and very nice staff!!
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Theresa,United States of America,6 Reviews,February 27  2017,10,Would have loved a refrigerator in our room. but we didn't ask ahead of time.  It would be nice if every room had one.,Loved the convenient location and had a comfortable stay.
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,February 21  2017,6.7,I didn't like how much I was charged after buying the room. I get it for wifi &amp; parking but the way they charged me was rather confusing.,I loved the shuttle service! It was so easy to use and made traveling so much more convenient.
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Janny,Australia,27 Reviews,February 21  2017,9.6,A bar fridge in the room would have been handy but we survived.,Comfy bed. Extremely friendly staff. Welcome cookie is so good! Great value for money. Not too far from downtown at all. Subway within walking distance or a $6 Uber. Don't know why anyone would complain. The best value we've seen online for this city! We had wifi included and it was pretty good for hotel wifi. Markus organised this for us. Very helpful and welcoming. Not a lot on offer regarding restaurants which was fine as we ate downtown or walked to the 'star market' across the road where you can literally get everything you need! All in all. a great stay for our 3 day duration. Bonus. they serve Starbucks coffee in the cafe in the hotel which also serves a few optional choices for breakfast. lunch and dinners!
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Pedro Santana,Brazil,2 Reviews,February 1  2017,9.6,I have very little to complain.One of the clerks in the cafeteria made a huge confusion with my voucher and I had no idea what my balance was. Also. I found the breakfast value pretty expensive.I didn't have to pay for the wifi because I got a  coupon. but it is pretty expensive as in any hotel.,Hilton Bayside epitomizes all the best qualities you are looking in a hotel.  The staff (especially Kira and Natalia) made us feel home. I had a problem with the reservations and they fixed it instantly.  The hotel is a 3 minute walk from the red line T station. which connects your to the most important spots in Boston.  Cleaning is pristine and the beds are great. I really miss having my baths at Hilton! hahaAlso. there are coffee machines in every room.The only difference for the HHonors room is some of the bathroom items - besides the usual. you get a sewing kit and shower cap.
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Pamela,United States of America,1 review,January 20  2017,10,Poor buffet selection; not worth the price.  Trouble signing into wifi.  but no worries.  I will definitely stay again and recommend.,Very friendly staff. I instantly felt welcome.  Impressed with cleanliness of the facility.
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Dorothy,United States of America,4 Reviews,January 9  2017,10,The awesome chocolate chip cookies were delicious but my husband who is more of a fan of cookies than I would prefer them w/out the walnuts. Haha,Loved the hot chocolate when you come in! The staff was very friendly and very accommodating!  The room was very clean and the bed couldn't have been more comfortable.  We will definitely stay again.
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Ctyopa,United States of America,12 Reviews,January 4  2017,10,You need to take the T to find entertainment - there were no bars/restaurants within walking distance. This is a 'very' small gripe. though.,The location was within walking distance to the 'T' mass transit system. the facility was clean and well kept. the mattress thick and comfortable. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. especially Natalia.
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,syy819,Canada,9 Reviews,January 1  2017,6.7,The paid wifi was a big disappointment. I got very poor signal level as I get close to the window. It's only stable when I was sitting on the toilet. My room was #307. I would consider this acceptable if it's free but it's 10 extra $ per day. Parking is not free either. I really think they can do better with this price. I chose here because I was visiting a friend going to UMass and this place has the best location. One more thing worth notice is that the ac unit in my room is very loud when the fan turns on. I'm okay with it but light sleepers may have problems.,Friendly staff. Room looks new. Bed is comfortable and supplies from Crabtree &amp; Evelyn is excellent. Room is generally clean.
DoubleTree Club by Hilton Hotel Boston Bayside,Lisa,United States of America,1 review,December 12  2016,7.5,Found out upon arrival that I had to pay $ 12.00 for parking. I should have moved my car over to another area as there seemed to be tons of parking space in the area. I understand in the city but this was not downtown Boston or New York so did not seem appropriate. I opted out of Wifi when I found out there was an additional charge for that as well. Seriously?,Bed was comfortable. Room was clean.
One-Bedroom on Newbury Street Apt 32,Theo,Netherlands,11 Reviews,May 24  2017,6.3,Badroom was old and not really comfortable.Price of the accomodation was way too expensive for the value of the appartment.No possibilities to leave bags before checkin time or after checkin time. As a result we had to drag our bags through the city twice.,Good location
One-Bedroom on Newbury Street Apt 32,Cinci,United States of America,1 review,April 24  2017,6.7,Needs updating.  The blinds in the bedroom broke the first time we tried to use them. the toilet seat is frayed. the chain came off the toilet when flushing (revealing it is connected by a fish hook). heater thermostat (no AC) is outdated and very difficult to figure out. things like that were not ideal.,The location is amazing.  So much to do on Newbury Street. and walking distance from everywhere we wanted to see in Boston.
One-Bedroom on Newbury Street Apt 32,Anonymous,United States of America,23 Reviews,April 11  2017,8.8,Very noisy alley with trucks making deliveries all night long--had to keep windows closed to avoid being woken up.  Expensive parking in the vicinity but that is to be expected given the fantastic location on the most desirable street in Boston.  Only one small bed. so one of us had to sleep on the couch.,Excellent location-tops for those attending conventions in Boston (location. location. location). Great efficiency apartment. No more than a room at the convention hotels.
One-Bedroom on Newbury Street Apt 32,Fanqi,China,1 review,March 29  2017,7.1,The bed is really small so i don't recommend two people to live in that room. The kitchen is small too. Wifi is not really fast. Anything else was fine.,The room is very clean and the location is very convenient. It only takes 5 minutes to walk to the subway.
One-Bedroom on Newbury Street Apt 32,Regina,United States of America,1 review,September 19  2016,9.6,Bed was not.. Well not the comfort of my home bed.. But where is??Trouble with 2nd key.

The Ritz-Carlton, Boston,darren ehgotz,United States of America,1 review,July 10  2017,7.5,No in room coffee and the general feel of the property did not reflect the room rate.,Close to Boston Common and walking distance to many local attractions.
The Ritz-Carlton, Boston,Alan,United Kingdom,10 Reviews,September 5  2016,8.3,For the price there should have been complimentary bottled water and a coffee/tea facility in the room could,The breakfast was superb. large room and large bath/shower room
The Ritz-Carlton, Boston,Anonymous,Saudi Arabia,19 Reviews,September 3  2016,7.5,I booked a room for 4 adults and they provided me a king bed room hardly fits 2 adults.  If it wasn't for Ibrahim the Bellman's help in finding another bigger room. I would have probably left the hotel for another one.,N/A
The Ritz-Carlton, Boston,Richard,Ireland,3 Reviews,August 6  2016,6.3,The Ritz Carlton doesn't compare favourably against similarly priced properties I have stayed at.  My son is an avid swimmer and the bookings review indicated a pool. but it's actually in a gym next door and only open to adults.  We had a suite and if you walk barefoot on the carpet. your feet get really dirty.  The decor is quite dated.  I paid over $10k for my stay (including a few meals and cars etc) and was still charged for Wifi.  I would have moved if it wasn't for the lack of availability for rooms of comparable size in the area. the really nice staff and the hassle of moving and disrupting our vacation. which was focused on the sights and sounds of Boston and not the hotel.,The location was excellent and the staff were very friendly and helpful.  The room size was large which is great for a family of 3 ( we had a separate living/sleeping area).
The Ritz-Carlton, Boston,Aideen,Singapore,23 Reviews,April 18  2016,9.6,I am disappointed there is a charge for wifi. Wifi should be included. Hotels with lower margins include free wifi. It is just a matter of time before all hotels do the same. What about Ritz Carlton leading the way?,Location close to Boston common and the excellent sports club Are what draws me back to Ritz Carlton Boston every time.
The Ritz-Carlton, Boston,Karen,United States of America,5 Reviews,March 2  2016,10,There is nothing that I did not like. except that I had to leave.,I travel regularly and can honestly say that I have never experienced such outstanding service from the thousands of hotels that I have visited around the world.

The Michelle 1,GA_Traveler,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 28  2017,10,The flight of stairs was a challenge. however.

It was walking distance to TD Garden Arena. the North Station T. walking distance to all of the major Italian restaurants and attractions in the North End of Boston. and last. the city view at night was spectacular. The apartment is adorable. it was a home away from home!

One-Bedroom on Arch Street Apt 3C,Anonymous,Canada,1 review,August 14  2017,5.8,This was not a fit for 4 people. The description said there were 2 beds. one is actually a sofabed in the same room as the other bed. The reason we selected this property was on the belief that there were 2 real beds. The sofabed was very uncomfortable and there weren't enough sheets in the room.,Location is right downtown. this would have been great for 2 people.
One-Bedroom on Arch Street Apt 3C,Horacio,Panama,1 review,July 20  2017,7.5,We did not sleep for three nights.  The noise from the street was unbearable.  Cleaning trucks. motorcycles. trucks unloading goods at a near supermarket. police cars. etc.  There are no ear plugs in the world that would prevent you from going crazy over the noice.  We were exhausted during the day from lack of sleep. They must do something to insulate the windows. I would never stay in that apartment again.,Location was very good. good size apartment. it was really as shown on the Bookings.com pictures.
One-Bedroom on Arch Street Apt 3C,Mjof,United Kingdom,9 Reviews,May 20  2017,6.3,Street noise interfered with sleep. Stairway needed to be vacuumed.

Steep  stairs. No lift access from ground floor.,Very convenient for subway

Stunning 2 Bedroom Apartment by Boston University with Parking,Marc,United States of America,1 review,September 10  2017,9.2,The outside of the building is tired and was going through some updates. Some apartments in the building were also were being updated. It can be a bit noisy. but you're in college territory so it's expected. Keep this in mind if you book in this area.,The apartment inside is brand new. updated. and very clean. Its in a central location that was convenient to and from fenway park. Parking on site is a plus.

94 Charles Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,John,United Kingdom,17 Reviews,October 18  2017,7.1,Old creaky sofa and creaky but comfortable bed. Bedside small wardrobes on both sides of the bed made it impossible to put water or a book beside the bed. Noisy neighbors overhead (even could hear snoring during the night). Cold living area with draught from poorly fitted AC unit.,The location was exceptional. The kitchen and bathroom was high standard
94 Charles Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Adrianus,Netherlands,52 Reviews,June 14  2017,4.6,There is a mouldy smell present throughout the appartment which is very unpleasant. The elevator makes a terrifying rattle just before it arrives on the 5 Floor. The loud rattle noise got worse during the week. There were dirty glasses in the cupboards. The rug in front of the kitchen has not been cleaned for a long time. There were (dog?)hairs and accumulated dust piles on it. The windows don't close the sound from the street off properly. especially the window where the airco is placed. The airco makes a terrible noise. The bed has a most uncomfortable matrass: no support whatsoever with a hurting back as a result after one week of sleeping on it. The shower has poor waterpressure and a faulty switch to go from faucet to showerhead: water gets all over the place. All in all a poor experience.,N/A
94 Charles Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Arn,United States of America,1 review,June 9  2017,7.1,Very noisy right on Charles street. AC/heating unit in the window was not a good fit so noise and outside air were not controllable. Curtains were not heavy enough to block out strong sun. Toilet needs a new flapper valve so water doesn't run periodically between flushes.,Location to restaurants and downtown is super.
94 Charles Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anonymous,Canada,1 review,June 7  2017,9.6,N/A,Honestly. I would move in to this apartment. Lovely heritage building. Bright. nicely decorated. high ceilings. comfy bed and towels. pristine.  Beacon Hill is a fantastic location. and the price was better than any downtown hotel.  Having a code for doors rather than keys made it very convenient for variable arrival times (our arrival flight was delayed).  We only met staff through email or phone. but they were always courteous and helpful.
94 Charles Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Ronald,United States of America,10 Reviews,April 10  2017,3.3,The heat is not controllable and one thermostat controls most of the units. We were the only occupied unit in the building during our stay and the heat was not turned on for the building. It was below freezing outside. So I had to call their maintenance service at 11PM and they had to instruct me over the phone how to turn on the heat up on the fifth floor upon our arrival late at night. Not fun. We left the place after 2 nights because we could not control the temp. It was not a comfortable place to stay full time. It was clean but there is no maid service and no way to order it even if you are willing to pay.,The location was ideal and close to all major shopping and site seeing places.
94 Charles Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Earl,United States of America,1 review,March 23  2017,7.5,a lot of additional cost not seen when booking on -line.Maintenance not readily accessible.,proximity to the conference and park.good use of space with the Murphy bed.
94 Charles Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Ruth,United Kingdom,11 Reviews,November 23  2016,7.5,1.Could not get connection to WiFi for some reason.2. The main reason for not giving comfort etc. a higher score was the heating. Seemed to be centrally controlled so could not adjust it ourselves. We were there in November and for the first 2 nights heating was on full blast 9pm - 3am then 48hours with no heating at all. then intermittent blasts of heating 4pm - 10pm and so it continued for the 2 weeks we were there. You are either sweltering or freezing !,Standard of facilities was good. Plenty of storage. very comfortable bed .Location fantastic.
94 Charles Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Stephen,United States of America,2 Reviews,November 6  2016,5.8,The room was terribly warm (around 75-80F) despite me complaining via text message. the only means possible since there is only a recorded message otherwise. I was told in response "open a window". The room is appropriate for an older house.but I would not go back because of the absence of local (in the room) heat / thermostatic control.,Location very good for meeting at 4 Seasons Hotel.

94 Charles Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Boston,United Kingdom,1 review,November 1  2016,7.9,Would have liked a change of towels and sheets at least once while we were there. Towels also weren't very big and a bit tatty. Toilet was wobbly and didn't feel like it was attached very well but nothing detrimental to our stay.,Really set the scene for city from the start!Perfect location! So close to everything and a beautiful setting. Cozy studio apartment with a decent standard of facilities. Very comfortable and clean.
94 Charles Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Nissim,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 30  2016,3.8,For 300$ per night i would expect everything to be much more than it was. The toilet were broken and didn't work properly. the water stream was weak...,N/A

94 Charles Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Linda,United States of America,2 Reviews,August 28  2016,5.0,I asked for a non-smoking room. but smoke constantly filled the apartment from one of the heating ducts. It was so bad that it seemed as if someone was actually smoking in the apartment. My eyes were bloodshot and my throat was sore. I asked the management to fix this problem and they did nothing about it. and in fact never followed up with me. I asked for a partial refund for my inconvenience since I had to endure these circumstances for my entire stay. I did not even receive a response from management. which is not at the site and can only be contacted by phone or email. Had my visit to Boston been longer. I would have found other accommodations.,The location was very convenient and central. It was easy to walk to most places. Too bad that actually being in the apartment was unpleasant due to cigarette smoke.

Reggie's Place,Nick,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 25  2017,8.3,N/A,Nice wee place. Clean and comfortable. Can't really comment on location as I was only there for a night and didn't arrive until late. but it seems like a nice part of town. Plenty bars. shops and restaurants nearby. Parking just round the corner too.Would definitely recommend for a cheap and cheerful stay ğŸ˜€
Reggie's Place,Charlene,Canada,43 Reviews,October 11  2017,9.2,The main living area was dark and the bedroom quite bright.  Some room darkening shades or curtains would be nice in the bedroom.  Otherwise everything was great.  It's an apartment so expect noise from others. especially somebody walking with shoes on on hardwood floors above.,Really comfortable bed and pillows.
Reggie's Place,Xu,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 5  2017,8.8,The luggage deposit (just put in the basement storage room) will cost $35â€¦â€¦ And we are not told about the fee the first time we asked about this service. They just tell us the charge when we about to leave â€¦â€¦,N/A
Reggie's Place,Gareth,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,September 4  2017,4.2,Having constant phone calls from the increasingly rude owners and having the bill almost doubled with hidden charges - $100 for cleaning? Really??My partner - who booked the apartment - is adamant that there was no notification of the cleaning fee at all when she booked. When I have looked that is true. there is no mention of it at all. even when you look at the small print. although on the final stage of booking it does mention it - she says this wasn't the case when she booked. I have no way of proving this one way or another. so this has caused another bone of contention.It seems strange to me that I provided my card details at the point of booking yet this was either not passed on to the apartment owners or was simply deleted. Either way. when my credit card provider flagged them up as fraudulent and declined payment (a good shout if you ask me) they treated me as though it was somehow my fault and harassed me constantly.I tried to explain that I was away from the apartment and would happily meet them face to face at 10pm that evening to resolve the issue. yet after this had been agreed the owners kept on harassing us with multiple phone calls and even asked the Booking people to arrange the meeting that I had previously asked them to arrange.The irony of this was that when we did meet at the prescribed time the problem was resolved within a few minutes. payment went through - albeit through gritted teeth from my point of view as the bill had gone up from the Â£112 advertised to Â£206 once all the hidden charges had been added.To add insult to injury. because of the situation above we didn't feel like exploring Boston any more and decided to just go back to the apartment and watch a movie whilst we waited for the owners to come over. however the internet and TV wouldn't work. so we were left with a bored 6 year-old to entertain and two very annoyed adults - an absolute waste of the last evening of our holiday.,Location was pretty good.

One-Bedroom on Washington Street Apt 205,Allison,United States of America,1 review,August 28  2017,10,It was a bit noisy. but that's what you being smack dab in the middle of the city. Couch could have been a bit more comfy for the person sleeping on it.,N/A
One-Bedroom on Washington Street Apt 205,Paige,France,11 Reviews,June 2  2017,8.3,The apartment is on the 1st floor and at almost a T junction of streets so at times it felt as if the traffic at night was coming right into the apartment through the fabulous bay window. We were there Thursday to Saturday so very lively. The honking outside didn't bother me as much as the elephant stomping around over my head (back and forth. back and forth for about twenty minutes in the middle of the night!) He/she/it woke me up twice each night around 1 am then 3 am.  Would have banged on the ceiling but it's two stories above so out of reach. To be fair. no one else in my group seemed to have been bothered by this. We were sleeping in the more private bedroom which I would have assumed would be quieter.,It was a double keyless entry so just needed to save the codes to my phone. Simple. The team was very helpful both before and after our arrival. I thought we needed an air mattress  since it wasn't clear how the sofa functions from the photo and we had my 84 yr old mother in law and 27 year old step son sharing this space at night. The sofa is actually composed of two sections that flatten into a single and a double bed. You can easily configure them into the sleeping arrangement you want since they are lightweight. Not easy however to share one comforter so the staff brought a second one the next night since it was chilly. The other remark I passed on was that the slippery pleather surface does not work well with flat sheets. They should think about having fitted ones. Otherwise. they reported being very comfortable.The decor was exactly as pictured. very modern. very tasteful. The kitchen was well equipped (with a coffee machine AND coffee as well as tea) so great to get started. Bathroom shower had nice design and quality bath products. We only had two days to give an overview of Boston so it was terrific to be in the middle of things!
Charlesview Suites Back Bay,Anonymous,Australia,28 Reviews,October 18  2016,10,What's not to like?,This spacious apartment has a fabulous view and is within walking distance of everything we wanted to visit in Boston. though subway stations are minutes away for people who want to use public transport. We travelled by Amtrak to Back Bay Station and reached the property after a pleasant 15 minute walk along the Southwest Corridor Path.  We found great coffee and shopping in nearby Newbury St.  The apartment is also close to parks and museums. The kitchen. in particular. was a joy and excellent cooking supplies were easily found close by.  It had everything we could want for a most enjoyable stay.

I had experienced two hot water down during my stay when I would like to take a shower and this was unacceptable. The room is small! Even for me as a single traveler. I hurt myself hitting the corner of bed frame several times and there is no decent space for hanging cloth! The wall is thin.,They offered complimentary breakfast when the restaurant downstairs were closed for renovation. Staffs are attentive and the toiletries are good brand. They offer free bikes onsite though I didn't use.
The Boxer,Gail,United States of America,4 Reviews,July 3  2017,7.1,The rooms are very small. they really jammed a king bed in a little room.

The Boxer,Anonymous,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,July 1  2017,5.0,The restaurant was closed for a refurb and as a result we had to eat our breakfast in the lobby on our knees. We had tiny plastic plates and plastic cutlery and a poor food choice . I was not informed by booking.com that this was the case . It was not the service we wanted for 675 dollars for 2 nights!!,The room was good

The valet on Saturday was extremely helpful giving us directions to several places of interest.

I can highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Boston!
The Boxer,Alfred,United States of America,1 review,May 30  2017,9.2,A little lower on the price.,Location excellent. Staff very friendly. Room beautifully appointed. Parking easy. Parking fee a bit high and disappointed that rates were jacked up for graduation week. which is why we were there.
The Boxer,Jonathan,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,May 15  2017,7.1,The area is a little soulless and rather functional. We also did not like the poor staffing of the breakfast area which was at times empty of personnel,We liked the building itself. a smart conversion of an old Flat Iron. The rooms are very comfortable and smartly designed with some nice touches of technology.
The Boxer,Anonymous,Canada,4 Reviews,April 26  2017,7.5,low water pressure and clogging toilet. That really was it.,The location is amazing and the rooms are reasonably sized if you are the type that spends your time out and not in your room (which even then. was comfortable when we lounged around). The only major issue is that it is an older building and it seemed that some updates were purely cosmetic rather than functional and so there were some plumbing and lighting issues in the room that were annoying but not game breaking. I think they will fix things as they come and the head staff seemed keen to work with us to get things taken care of.
The Boxer,Mary-anne,New Zealand,7 Reviews,April 22  2017,6.3,The location felt threatening at night. I didn't like leaving alone on foot to dine. Room also rather smaller than shown on booking.com.,Trendy hip style.
The Boxer,Jennifer,United States of America,1 review,April 15  2017,9.2,The breakfast buffet wasn't our favorite. There was only 1 server in the morning and the food wasn't up to par.

The Boxer,Anonymous,United States of America,5 Reviews,April 10  2017,9.6,N/A,The room was perfect. loved the robe and toiletries. The fact I could regulate the temperature without needing a manual to work the thermostat was ah-maze-ing!!
The Boxer,Albert,United States of America,1 review,April 10  2017,9.6,N/A,Location was the key.  We  went to a Celtics game and we were near most of the historic attractions of Boston.  We had a very nice room and the service was great.

The Boxer,Kristie,United States of America,1 review,April 5  2017,9.6,For over $300 the room could be bigger.... I had a bruise on my shin from hitting the corner of the bed to get to the other side.,It was easy to get to and the location was excellent.

The Boxer,Tristinna,United States of America,1 review,March 29  2017,6.7,Parking was pricey. breakfast buffet was pricey and cold. middle of the night the heat apparently shut off it was very cold. when we arrived our reservation was either not ready or not sure what their system issue was so they "upgraded" us to a junior suite which was supposedly bigger but I'd be afraid to see our original booking if that was a better room. They have to refund and recharge my account waiting to see how that plays out. However. that being said the assistant general manager was visibly frazzled by the ordeal and was tirelessly trying to figure it out. he was very friendly and left me his business card to stay in contact after our stay to ensure the matter of billing was resolved properly.,The style of the hotel. friendliness of the front staff. Proximity was within walking. a street over. from TD garden which is why we stayed there. Go Celtics!
The Boxer,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,March 28  2017,9.6,N/A,Walking distance to North End. TD Garden. T station. and the historical sights downtown. Room was beautiful (if smaller. but that's to be expected in an older building; didn't detract from our experience at all). bed was comfortable. towels were plush. and every staff member we met was helpful. pleasant. and accommodating. Highly recommend. If you like the idea of a smaller. well-appointed boutique hotel with style and flair. this is the one.
The Boxer,Rosa,Spain,1 review,March 27  2017,10,apples at the fitness center were quite old and spoiled,Location was excellent. romos were confortable and the bed fantastic. sport center was Little but good.People were extrmely friendly and charming. I  will for suere return and recommend it

The Boxer,Katharine,United States of America,1 review,March 13  2017,8.3,Down tops for the beds would be nice. I requested via email (that was sent to me asking for any special instructions) for a basket of snacks and sodas to be in our room for our late arrival and two beds as I was traveling with my son. On arrival at 945pm. front desk told me I could get two beds for an upgrade fee...... Also they had not received my request for snacks because no one checked they emails that day. The waitress in the Finch quickly took over. took our order from the restaurant and delivered it to our room. Clearly she had more experience with customer service than the front desk did.,room was VERY clean. Location was excellent. Quaint boutique hotel who's rooms are quite small (no closet) but clean and updated. Great view of the city.
The Boxer,Jen,United States of America,1 review,March 6  2017,7.9,Parking situation had a major hiccup. they lost our vehicle then made us wait 2 hours before locating our car. During this time. they kept promising our car was next. even when it became apparent that they did not know where our car was located. Although parking was reimbursed. we did not hear back from any management even after it was promised they would be in contact.  This was very frustrating. considering I tried contacting them through several emails.,Great location. comfortable room.
The Boxer,Anonymous,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,March 6  2017,7.9,Bigger gym area - extremely tight. Rooms could use a touch up. nice look but showing their age.,Comfy bathrobe. good products in bathroom. comfortable bed.
The Boxer,Crystal,United States of America,1 review,March 5  2017,9.6,The breakfest was very pricey . my daughter had the buffet for 8 dollars but wasn't worth the price for adults for such a small buffet  . so we ordered from the menu instead but we waited a long time for food and again Food was good ! Just very over priced !  Also now I have to wait for 2 different charges to stop pending I got charged the booking.com price then another one at 322.78 I have called and they said that's for incidentals so I'm hoping it just disappears like brain said . I hope I don't have to fight the extra charge but only time will tell when charges are done pending !  Also snack bar mini fridge in room is not free and very very overpriced ! The prices should have been more realistic prices .,The bed was very comfortable. big enough for a 1 night stay w 2 adults 1 child in the king size bed we all slept very well ! The staff was very nice and even the valet driver . Also very close to everything where u can keep your car parked and just walk ! We was also on the 9th floor the view of Boston was awesome !
The Boxer,Katie,United States of America,4 Reviews,February 27  2017,8.3,The rooms and the bed seem quite small. and some of their facilities seemed poor. For example. the water from the bathroom tap was always at freezing - literally. It hurt my hands to wash them because the water was so cold and there was no option to increase the temperature. The staff also couldn't provide me with a receipt for my room service. saying that the system wouldn't allow them to do so. This seems a bit absurd.,Room and hotel was very clean. and loved the asthetics of the place. The staff were also very accommodating and kind.
The Boxer,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,February 23  2017,10,Standard King room is a little small.  No tub. just shower.,Excellent hotel with tremendously friendly and helpful staff.  Near everything including major train station.  Perfect location.
The Boxer,Crystal,United States of America,1 review,February 20  2017,7.5,Some of the other staff was shut off and not so friendly.,The doorman mark was the highlight of the stay. Very friendly and helped out with directions and answers any questions you may have.
The Boxer,Mark,Australia,5 Reviews,February 2  2017,7.5,room size was poky and water temp in shower was inconsistent,beds were uber comfortablegreat location with good bars around. The Porter was a top spot with close proximity to markets
The Boxer,Jennifer,United States of America,1 review,January 30  2017,8.8,The bartender was horrible!  It was a slow night and it took her 20 minutes to pour a beer because she was too busy laughing it up over the TV.,The location can't be beat if you are attending an event at the Garden.  Easy to walk to the T and restaurants.
The Boxer,Sara,United States of America,1 review,January 25  2017,8.8,There weren't a lot of options for restaurants near. but it was a great starting point for walking the City.,Staff was very friendly and helpful.  The bed was very comfortable and they left a little gift for my husband since we were there celebrating his birthday.  We checked in very late for our first day reservation and it wasn't a problem at all.  Really enjoyed our stay.
The Boxer,Michelle,United States of America,3 Reviews,January 22  2017,7.5,The room was tiny. my husband and I kept bashing our shins on the edge of the bed frame which was larger than the mattress!!!   The room was painted very dark and the iron furnishings gave me the feeling of being in a well furnished jail cell.,Cute lobby with Boxer dog theme but not overdone.  Fresh fruit infused water was a very nice touch in the lobby.
The Boxer,Larissa,United States of America,1 review,January 16  2017,10,That we had to pay 98 cents for a bucket of ice.,The people were wonderfully likable and friendly as well as helpful. Our room was clean. comfortable. and cozy. We like how unique it was in design. The bed was like Baby Bear's from Goldilocks. just right.
The Boxer,Lianqing,China,3 Reviews,January 6  2017,9.2,It'll be perfect if do better in sound isolation.,location. service. user-friendly facilities...  everything! It was a considerate and pleasant stay here.
The Boxer,Toppkatt,Sweden,11 Reviews,January 6  2017,9.2,As with most centrally-located hotels. the rooms can be seen as fairly small.   However. we were a family of four so not so surprising.,Staff seemed genuine and very friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was very good.
The Boxer,mxk,Netherlands,7 Reviews,January 4  2017,9.2,(Valet) parking is expensive. Room was a bit small.,Very pleasant experience. The room was good. clean and had a rich minibar. Very nice bar/restaurant/breakfast accomodation. Personell (we were helped by luckas) was extraordinary kind and helpful.
The Boxer,Timothy,United States of America,1 review,January 4  2017,9.6,Our room had a slight rattle coming from the heating unit.,We arrived early. The staff happily took our bags. so we could  wander through town. That was nice. We came back later to check in... when we did. we were informed that our bags had already been brought up to our room. THAT was the above and beyond detail that makes a difference.  The morning breakfast server was a pleasure as well.Thanks! Tim
The Boxer,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,January 3  2017,8.8,The view out the window was one of the ugliest buildings in Boston and maybe the world. (Brutalist government center). Can't really be helped by the hotel but try to stay on the north side.,Super friendly staff. Room was immaculately clean.
The Boxer,Barbara,Australia,2 Reviews,January 3  2017,9.6,Just one minor detail. On our last day we returned just after 4pm and the room had not been made up. There was a knock on the door a little later asking us if we wanted clean linen etc. as we were getting ready to go out it was not s convenient time.,Great location and good size room.
The Boxer,Rick,United States of America,2 Reviews,December 21  2016,7.9,My room had a space heater in it for heat so the bathroom was 45 degrees bathroom door was broken got locked in for 10 min stayed here before loved ithe not so much this time .... It was only at 45% capacity and they put me in a room that should of been closed for repair or maybe they should get a new maintenance Staff!!,N/A
The Boxer,Janet,United States of America,1 review,December 4  2016,9.0,For 3 adults the size of the room was something of a squeeze.,Staff was great--can't say enough about them. They seemed to be a real team &amp; actually enjoy working there! Decor was was very current. Beds were comfortable &amp; though we were skeptical about how quiet the 2nd floor room might be. it was amazingly so.
The Boxer,Dale,United States of America,1 review,November 15  2016,6.7,It was questionable if in fact they had valet parking. no one in sight when we pulled up. waited a couple of minutes.double parked.went in and asked and was told they would be with us shortly. I guess you have to be ready for that type of Valet with only one person working it.,Beds were comfy.
The Boxer,Veronika,Luxembourg,7 Reviews,November 6  2016,6.7,For the price the room was surprisingly small with extremely limited hanging and unpacking area.,The location is convenient for visiting all of the downtown
The Boxer,Anto219,Italy,95 Reviews,November 5  2016,8.8,I would remove carpets (hate them in general). the rest is just fine.Unfortunately next to my room there were a bunch of Young men partying until 4 am. and running along the corridor shouting all the time. But this is not a hotel's problem. but rather of people being stupid and rude.,The receptionist was very fast and friendly. a very pleasant check in!Room was fairly nice. and bed extremely comfortable!
The Boxer,Anya,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 17  2016,6.3,the staff was not helpful at all. nobody even tried to help with the luggages neither at check-in nor check-out. never had to deal with this issue at any star hotel.,N/A
The Boxer,Jeff,United Kingdom,38 Reviews,September 28  2016,7.5,Limited breakfast. Not the best location in the city. The Boxer is more of a budget hotel than a boutique property.,Cozy room with a nice big bed. A friendly welcome at check in.
The Boxer,Karenjean,United States of America,5 Reviews,September 27  2016,8.8,Walls are thin... Very noisy neighbors.(2:30 a.m. 2 out of the 3 nights we stayed)Couldn't get Seattle football game on T.V.,Great location. can walk to most attractions.Very friendly staff...Room had little extras: soaps in shower. magnifying mirror for make- up. many towels. Robe. great bed.
The Boxer,Regular,United Kingdom,1 review,September 26  2016,8.3,Quality of the food; not bad food but not good enough to tempt us back for a second breakfast or second bar snack.,Staff. location and quality of the bed!
The Boxer,Kevin,Belgium,11 Reviews,September 26  2016,10,N/A,We visited Boston and this hotel for 3 days and we booked last minute through booking.com when we where driving into the city and this hotel was total possitive supprise when we entered!+ The room and bathroom where very spacious+ friendly and helpfull staff+ free bike rental+ nice design+ loved the atmosphere
The Boxer,Marcel,Switzerland,34 Reviews,September 18  2016,7.9,The hotel seems to have had its best shape a couple of years ago. The minibar fridge in our room was leaking and the carpet wet.I asked if i can print travel documents from a USB stick and i was pointed to the PC opposite of the reception. but it didn't work.,The hotel is in perfect reach to Logan airport: you can take the blue train feom the airport and ride it 4stops til the final station. BOWDOIN- from here it is a 4 min walk! We had to stay over in Boston for a night on our way ro Bermuda. so it was perfect
The Boxer,Paul,United Kingdom,9 Reviews,September 15  2016,7.5,We had breakfast on two days in the hotel. One day (Sunday) the service was great - the next day it was very poor.While the hotel is quite central. the choice of restaurants very close to the hotel is not good,Front desk staff were friendly and happy to give advice etc.Nice hotel with funky rooms. Room we had was a bit noisy at night - can turn the fridge off but still noise from air con or something else.
The Boxer,Francis,Australia,11 Reviews,September 8  2016,8.8,The bed platforms! Perhaps if they were painted white they would become part of the bed and maybe missed a little more! They are now the colour of the carpet - beware!,The staff! Very helpful and welcoming and happy! Loved the L'octaine toiletries. Free bikes were a good idea too but it rained during my visit.
The Boxer,Goncalo,Portugal,4 Reviews,September 7  2016,9.2,Boston is a busy street and the windows should provide a better sound proof of the surroundings.,The staff was extremely helpful and kind. The room is good but not big if you plan to have a meal for four persons. The location is great. specially if you are a sport fan.
The Boxer,Hilary,United Kingdom,1 review,September 2  2016,9.6,Bit noisy outside as they were doing roadworks but apart from that a very quiet hotel,Great location. Comfy Beds Staff were very helpful and always welcomed us after our days out.
The Boxer,Erin,Canada,1 review,September 1  2016,10,N/A,The staff at the boxer were exceptionally friendly! They were very hospitable and made us feel very comfortable. The room was clean and very elegant. The boxer hotel was within 1 km walking distance of the north end and all it has to offer! Great location. great staff. excellent hotel!! P.s. James the bartender was awesome!
The Boxer,John,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,August 27  2016,10,Great location for the freedom trail and ten mins walk from Regina pizzeria best pizza we have ever tasted. Mind you we are Scottish and it's usually deep fried...,Great hotel staff were great especially CJ who was greatl at sorting out the internal phone problem.  Which was down too operator error but never made an issue.
The Boxer,Andrew,Australia,14 Reviews,August 27  2016,9.6,N/A,Very cool place. popular as well! Great amenities in the room... The staff are always friendly and super helpful.Good location...an easy walk to most places in Boston and central between the two main parts of the city.
The Boxer,Graeme,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,August 18  2016,10,Nothing,Staff - friendly. helpful and sorted out a couple of issues for us quickly and with a smile. Location - outstanding. Close to subway and central BostonHotel - Really clean and smart
The Boxer,Melanie,Netherlands,1 review,August 17  2016,5.8,There was no room service or food in the hotel as chef was sick. I was surprised that another chef was not organised. Room was okay for a single guest staying for 1 night but too small for a couple. Very cramped and nowhere to put your clothes away tidily.Not a great area to stay. there are much nicer areas of Boston!Buffet breakfast served was what I would expect in a budget hotel.,Comfortable bed
The Boxer,Kevin,United Kingdom,27 Reviews,August 14  2016,9.2,N/A,Great location for exploring this easily walkable city. Very welcoming &amp; helpful StaffVery close to 'T' line station - Bowdoin.Choice of pubs and restaurants within 5 minutes walk.
The Boxer,Adrian,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,August 2  2016,5.8,We had booked 2 rooms for our 3 night Boston trip - King Room for us and a Double Double (ie with 2 double beds) for our teenagers. I booked this in December for our July visit.I emailed twice before arrival to request that the rooms were close by (on the same floor) and both times got no reply - and that should have alerted me and to be honest sums up 'Boxer Customer Service'.On arrival we were told that there were no rooms available with 2 beds. the guy on reception seemed clueless how to help us. Our teenagers were supposedly 'upgraded' to a suite where my son had to sleep on a sofa / pull out bed (or share a King size bed with his sister). Totally unacceptable - I booked these rooms 6 months in advance.All in all we had interactions with 4 different staff members (including someone from Accounts who had to process a compensation refund) and at no time did either my wife nor I feel like the Customer . . . . you know the kind? The PAYING Customer! So in terms of Comfort score - low because my son was on a sofa bed for 3 nights. In terms of Value for Money - low = $1800 and my 16 year old son gets a sofa bed?In terms of Staff score - low because they are in serious need of some Customer Service training.,The Boxer in Boston SHOULD be a fantastic hotel - it's a great building. location is excellent (we were able to explore everything that Boston has to offer from there). rooms are a good size but overall our stay was not as good as it should have been.Came away from our 3 night stay (planned and booked 6 months earlier) just feeling like we had been let down . . . .
The Boxer,Joseph,United Kingdom,11 Reviews,July 3  2016,7.9,At the minute not much to not like although it was a little quiet but putting that down to its recent opening and refurbishment.,Excellent location and lovely atmosphere. Staff friendly and helpful.
John Jeffries House,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,October 30  2017,5.8,The room was cold and i was directly under the breakfast room which meant that i was woken up at 6am every day when everyone went to breakfast.,I liked the location
John Jeffries House,Anonymous,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,October 24  2017,9.2,It would have been nice to have the option of tea/coffee in the room. Continental style breakfast fine. but some tables would have been nice and more convenient than all comfy chairs.,Great position for the T. Also good if you are prepared to walk - Boston Common about 10 minutes; main city sights about 20 minutes. Good. local restaurants. Great. comfortable bedroom. sitting room  and spacious bathroom.
John Jeffries House,Robert,United States of America,1 review,October 6  2017,5.8,Carpet was a bit tired looking. Sitting room furniture was not very comfortable. The sitting area was separate from the sleeping area. so you couldn't watch tv in bed. Not a huge deal but a bit unusual these days.,Comfortable bed. but only one lamp for reading and no night tables at all. I've never seen that in a hotel. There was a working kitchenette. but no coffee maker. Coffee was in the lobby but I would prefer not having to get dressed just to get coffee. Bath was very nice.
John Jeffries House,Julia,United Kingdom,15 Reviews,October 1  2017,8.8,Kitchenette with very little pots. cups bowls etc to use making facility difficult to use. This facility was one reason to book,Shampoo. shower fell in proper pump containers made using very easy
John Jeffries House,Tony,United Kingdom,46 Reviews,September 28  2017,4.6,Everything from start to finish could have been better.  Totally overpriced and totally disappointing.And definitely NOT boutique,The only good thing about this place is the location
John Jeffries House,Amanda,Bermuda,4 Reviews,September 28  2017,5.8,My room was below ground and dismal as a result. For more than $400 total for a night. it was just depressing.,The staff were pleasant and helpful. The large communal living room is a welcome place to sit. especially if you're traveling alone.
John Jeffries House,Maria,Russia,3 Reviews,September 15  2017,7.9,Unfortunately. the air-conditioner was a bit noisier than I had expected. As it was not really hot outside. it did not appear to be of a great concern. as I did not turn it on at night. Though it may become a slightly problematic issue in summer. The windows of my room could neither be completely opened nor absolutely shut which made me a bit thoughtful about how the staff managed to close the windows in winter.,The hotel is situated really conveniently. quite close to the underground station and not far from Boston Common. My room was quite small. still a cosy one. It was tidied up daily thus everything was neat. There was a sort of a mini 'kitchen-corner' with electric cooker. a microwave. a sink and a fridge. also there were a few items of cutlery. It could be quite convenient for those who prefer take away food. It would be even better if the hotel had added some more cups and an electric kettle. There is an elevator in the hotel. The internet was good.  I have no idea why free breakfasts are not mentioned in the hotel description. As for me. it came as a lovely surprise.
John Jeffries House,Hafþór Ingi,Iceland,1 review,September 11  2017,10,The internet connection could have been a little better. it was really slow. but it was nice to have internet. but I'm so used to a much better internet connection.,The staff was amazing. they were so nice! And my room was also really nice and clean.
John Jeffries House,Denise,United States of America,2 Reviews,July 25  2017,9.6,Parking was down the street at garage at $40 per night with discount mentioning John Jeffries House.,There was a kitchen area and sitting space separate from bedroom. Adequate space for 2 people. Bed was so comfortable.
John Jeffries House,Anonymous,United States of America,11 Reviews,July 22  2017,8.3,Communication attempts were not answered.  Booked months in advance but we were told rooms are assigned the day of check-in so our room type might not be available.  Eventually. we were given the room type we reserved. Breakfast is a limited continental type breakfast.,Perfect location for visiting Boston!
John Jeffries House,Holly,United States of America,1 review,July 14  2017,7.1,There was a Fire smoke alarm on basement floor and no staff answered phone when I called desk.  I had to go find someone and bring them to room with alarm.  Their central alarm system did not seem to work.,Nice room with good location and kitchenette
John Jeffries House,Joan,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 30  2017,5.8,No one to help with luggage. no iron. bad odor in elevator. poor lighting in bathroom especially. no television in bedroom. breakfast was cold cereal and muffins. etc.  Understaffed.,Nice decor in lobby. close proximity to public transportation. Quaint historical building.
John Jeffries House,Meryem,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,June 26  2017,8.8,Not a lot of choise for the breakfast. They should offer more with proper table and chair. No kettle in the rooms.,Great location. great area. Really convenient and clean place to stay.
John Jeffries House,Meg,Australia,2 Reviews,June 17  2017,8.8,Did not like the location of the room on the lower ground floor with high windows no view and very little natural light but as we were on a budget I suppose that s what you get !All supposedly hot drinks served In  thermos jugs at breakfast were lukewarm.,Disappointed we were allocated a room on the lower ground floor with high windows so it was dark with no view. Get what you pay for I guess.Only complaint.all breakfast drinks stored in thermos jug
John Jeffries House,Mark,United Kingdom,11 Reviews,June 15  2017,5.4,Unfriendly day-time reception staff.  No TV in the bedroom of the deluxe room. No dining tables for breakfast. only very low lounge ones - you have to hold your cereal bowl in your hand. ok for us but more problematic for older people,Near the subway station but a little walk from the city centre. Good free Wi-Fi.
John Jeffries House,Kayla,United States of America,1 review,June 5  2017,8.3,Pull out sofa wasn't very comfortable,Right across from the train so that was convenient. Pharmacy/store right next door that was open 24 hours. Our room was ready early. Pleasent staff.
John Jeffries House,Anonymous,United States of America,11 Reviews,May 30  2017,5.4,There were hairs in the bathroom. As they really couldn't be missed it got me wondering about the cleanliness of the rest of the room.And there wasn't even a nightstand by the bed. This is pretty basic. For the price. I would have expected one.,The proximity to the subway was very convenient.
John Jeffries House,Sandra,United States of America,1 review,May 29  2017,7.5,I suppose utter proximity to a large T station could be considered a boon by some. but it came with. of course. the roaring of a train every few minutes. Be forewarned.,Location depends on purpose; this was excellent for ours. We didn't bother with hotel parking; just parked in Public Gardens and schlepped luggage. of which we generally don't carry much.

Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Buzz Bee,United Kingdom,12 Reviews,October 26  2017,8.3,Very small room. No elevator and steep stairs. Not easy to get luggage to 3rd floor. The air con unit didn't function as air con... Just a fan. Entry is by door code. You need to ensure you remember the codes to your door and the front door. Don't write them down and then leave them in the room (most likely when using the bathroom),Shared bathroom was clean with a nice power shower. Bed was very comfortable. Good shared kitchen. Local transport was close. Bus from outside goes to town. to the beach and to the subway. Plenty of shops. bars and restaurants within easy walk
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Dennis,Netherlands,12 Reviews,October 24  2017,5.0,Room was very cramped. One side of the bed was tucked against a wall and the end was about 20cm of the wall. Worst thing was the heating. Even though it was the hottest October weekend in history. the heating kept blasting. The thermostat was locked. as well as the window. Only thing we could do was call the landlord at night or crank up the airco... The metro stations are quite far away. and yes. the bar across the street is rowdy. even on a Sunday. All in all. I wouldn't recommend staying here. Want cheap? Move further from the center and closer to public transport.,It was an affordable stay. For its location. it's quite cheap. Then wifi is fast as well and the kitchen was fully equipped for real cooking. The bed was firm and clean. The restrooms and rooms were clean. But you can see the usage over the years. I stayed for 3 nights and only came across a couple of people which is nice when you're sharing bathrooms.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Pana507,United States of America,5 Reviews,October 20  2017,5.4,There was absolutely no parking any where around the area at all.  we spent 3 hours of our time trying to figure out were to park our car. It Was very expensive to park overnight because there's not side street parking anywhere unless you have a permit . We decided on this place because it looked nice and it was fairly close to downtown Boston but there was no indication on Booking.com about the lack of parking and when I found out I called the property a week before my trip to ask about reserving a parking space. they told me there's no parking. and that I needed to pay 35$ overnight fee for a parking garage in Boston that wasn't even close to where I was staying.She told me that I needed to take a taxi  or try to find a side street parking in the area. there was absolutely none because it was ALL!! permit parking for residence in the area. or 2 hour parking maximum ONLY for visitors. after 3 hours of trying to find a parking spot I decided to call the rental company and explain my situation and they finally found a parking space for my car which took us another hour to find because they didn't give us any directions to the spot besides a picture of the actual spot. There was no street directions whatsoever on how to find it. they charged us 31.50 $ to parked there each day/night. On top of all this the very next morning after we needed to be somewhere at a very specific time and when we got to our car we realized someone had blocked us into our very expensive spot which took us 25 minutes to find out the owner of so they could move it. and we stressed the whole time about possibly missing our plans because of another situation around the parking fiasco.Booking.,The property itself was really good. and it was shorter ride to downtown Boston 15 minutes
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Georgina,United States of America,1 review,October 16  2017,10,N/A,The location was perfect for our stay. Just 15 minutes away from Downtown and Back Bay. all the public transportation was just down the street. It was a very safe area and we enjoyed the convenient 7-eleven and restaurant just steps away from the hotel. Will definitely stay here again next time we are in town.

Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,October 1  2017,5.0,The other people staying there were so loud and didn't care how much noise they were making. The kitchen pans were not non-stick. Whoever we shared the bathroom with always left a mess on the floor and it wasn't cleaned until 2 days later. One day the power went out and it took a long time to get a reply and no maintenance person comes...you have to fix it yourself. Overall. it's a place to sleep but I'd never do it again.,N/A
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,William,United States of America,1 review,September 29  2017,9.6,Closing time at the bar across the street made it difficult to have an uninterrupted nights sleep.,The room was bright and welcoming. it satisfied all our needs.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 19  2017,8.8,No dining table in the kitchen. If you cooked a meal. your only choice was to eat back in your room. which has exactly enough space for a desk and a bed. Not exactly the largest room - we brought 2 carry on luggages and 2 backpacks. and the room was quite cramped/awkward. Can't imagine bringing 2 full size luggage...,Very clean and convenient location. having everything you need if you're simply looking for a place to sleep and eat a couple of meals. However. considering how expensive it was it could have been a bit nicer. but it could just be the area is expensive.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Deborah,United States of America,4 Reviews,September 16  2017,4.6,Room smaller than it looked like in photos. No hangers in my room at all. The guy next door was smoking weed and put a towel underneath his door and this did not help.   I would NEVER EVER STAY HERE AGAIN.....the TV situation was so weird. I am from Cleveland and during the Indians streak and I could get no sports such as ESPN at all. I was in Boston....they are all about sports.  What is up with this.  DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!  Very noisy air conditioner which had to run all night.  I do Airbnb in Ohio and I have wonderful accommodations for a similar price.....and this place was a dump in comparison.  The only good thing was Dunkin Donuts was next door!!!!,The location was the only bonus and near the convention center.  One night all the electricity went off in my room only. When I called the emergency number did not seem that excited to help until I pushed it.  He told me to look for the electrical box.  It was obvious he did not know the property since the box was behind a locked door I did not have access to. NOT COOL IN MY BOOK.....it was hot and I could not see to pack and I was leaving early the next morning.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Kirsten,Belgium,6 Reviews,September 12  2017,6.7,The noise from the bar accross the street was really really  loud! I think it is only on friday and saturday really noisy. Room needs an refreshment: dirty walls,The keys were 2 codes. They worked so we hadn't have problens with that. The shared bathrooms were clean. You' ve only got to share it witg 2 other rooms. Dunkin donuts and shops are not far walking. We had the biggest room so we had just enough space!
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Marybeth,United States of America,4 Reviews,August 11  2017,7.0,3rd Floor!!!   Too many stairs to climb!  We are somewhat disabled - Tiny room. Would have been better with ONE slightly larger bed than a bunkbed.  On our way out of the building. we noticed that parties of only ONE had much larger spaces and Double beds. ??  On last morning of stay we were jolted awake by a fire alarm (someone burnt sausage) and my son could have injured himself worse than just having a 'limp' trying to get down the ladder in a hurry.  We managed. but we would also have liked a bathtub.... but shower was quite nice. though!,It was CLEAN!!
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Jessica,Canada,4 Reviews,August 4  2017,7.5,Suggestion: There should be more hooks and shelves in the bathrooms to be able to put our things while taking a shower. Same thing in the rooms. a few shelves or storage cabinets on the wall would be handy. Unfortunately there's no space to put a table in the kitchen.,Clean. comfy. air conditioning in the room. most guests were respectful with noise. Bathroom/room ratio is perfect. there was always at least a bathroom available if it was already taken. Great value for money and perfect location in South Boston. not too far from Broadway Station (Red line)
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Pauline,Belgium,5 Reviews,August 2  2017,7.5,Shared bathroom was not that clean. I don't know if they are cleaning every day. There is a washing machine. but no product. When you are backpacking. it's the last thing you carry with you. Washing machine only takes 30' so you're clothes are not that clean....Not very close to the center. you need public transports or users to get everywhere,There is no reception in this 'hotel'. you receive an email with all instructions or codes. It's very clear. There is a kind of book in the room with information about the neighbourhood. shops. restaurants. transports.... But I had a question about the washing machine.send it by mail and got never an answer back.  Room is good. clean &amp; spacious and felt secure.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Jeffrey,Netherlands,7 Reviews,August 1  2017,5.8,- noise. My room (second floor) was in the front. The bar across the street (with open windows) was keeping me up in the evening/night. The walls are also very thin. You can all the sounds (alarm. tv. people talking) coming from the other rooms- moldy smell in the room. Moreover. If people cooked with the hood on. i could still smell everything VERY well- very very small room. I had a room. which is meant for 2 persons. I still had to put my bag on the bed. Not enough room to put all my stuf or bag. The closet was also tiny with minimal amounts of clothes hangers.- only 2 towels available per room. per person. per stay (small and medium towel). That is not sufficient. You have to wash the towels yourself. Two towels is not enough. You have to wash if you are staying more than 4 days. Additionally. people do not dry the shares bathrooms because of the limited availability of towels. which leads to water in the bathrooms everywhere. You have to pay 1.50 dollar for a single use of the washing machine or dryer. There is not enough space anywhere to dry clothes. which cannot be put in the dryer.,- it is not a hotel. but the price is much cheaper compared to hotels  (approx $100 per night. Although work was paying. prices of the other venues were exuberantly high during my stay.- nearby bus stop (line 9/10). I had a conference at the prudential centre. The bus stopped right next to the venue. which was convenient for me. Anyway. transfer to other metro and bus lines is also easy with these bus lines- good wifi speeds- safe and nice neighbourhood. Everything available within walking distance
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Simon,Canada,1 review,July 25  2017,9.2,We drove from Canada and parking during our stay could have been more complicated. You can park for free in front of the apartment during the Week End only. which was the length of our stay. Otherwise the closest parking is 20min walk (116 W 1st St),Quarter on DOT is well located. Our room was confortable; bathroom and kitchen were clean! In extra. Quarter on Dot had great suggestions of Boston activities waiting for us in our room. including the nearest facilities around the area.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Leslie,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 24  2017,10,Parking wad not optimal. We were lucky we found a spot. but it was a crap shoot.,Location was fantastic. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Bathrooms were clean. I was skeptical about having shared bathrooms. but there were no issues at all. Although we didn't use them. both the kitchen and laundry facilities were very nice.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Donald,Canada,6 Reviews,July 20  2017,5.4,larger room.   area to eat -common area would be fine to eat or lounge.          fresh towel each day as they did not try well.    hooks on door and walls would be nice.

Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Judy,United States of America,1 review,July 16  2017,5.8,It was very cold after the first night due to the thunderstorms. and I contacted the emergency number to ask about adjusting the heating. no response. Also the TV in my room did not work. and also no response from staff. It is also not in walking distance to the T. only the local buses. which do not run that frequently. ~20 min walk from the T. which is difficult when you are hauling luggage.,The room was very neat. There is a bar across the street as well as a Dunking Donuts for breakfast.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Joanne,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,July 16  2017,5.8,It is clearly cleaned each morning. however as you are sharing it can easily turn grimy by the evening. A deal in a hotel would probably be better value for money.,Comfortable to stay in. easy to get to.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Carolina,Brazil,1 review,July 10  2017,9.2,My bedroom was close to the street. Sometimes I couldn't hear noises from there. The AC was old too. but worked well.,The place is in a very good location. Is 5 in by car from the downtown. There is a nice street near by if a lot of pubs. so you can go by foot. we enjoyed a lot!

Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,June 26  2017,9.6,Fire alarm went off and nobody knew what to do. fire department did come to turn off the alarm quickly.,Great little place to have as a home base while in Boston. Location was within walking distance of many things (as long as you consider two miles or so walking distance). Certainly not anything fancy. I can say if I should go back to Boston I would stay here again especially if on a budget.

Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,June 10  2017,5.8,Was very noisy. could hear every word being said by people on the street which isn't ideal when you're across the road from a busy bar. Not to mention the fact that the place is next to a busy intersection so you hear every vehicle that drives past including their music.,Communal bathroom and kitchen were well equipped and clean
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Thomas,Australia,6 Reviews,June 10  2017,5.4,There was no contact with staff while there. The room was very small and only provided 1 chair with the table so it was uncomfortable for 2 people. A big flaw was a lack of hanging hooks. The cupboard provided hanging but there was no where to hang wet towels or raincoats. If the vacant wall had shelves and places to hang towels and coats the experience would be more comfortable,The shared bathroom was clean and guests were respectful of others. The shared kitchen was also clean and provided a lot of equipment to use. including a washing machine and dryer The accommodation was also within walking distance of restaurants and grocery shops. It was comfortable after you got used to the spartan bedroom and it was easy enough to walk 15 minutes to the tube to get into the city. Quite easy to do
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Cathie,United States of America,1 review,June 10  2017,4.2,Unable to check in early even after asking.  Had to wander around the neighborhood for 4 hours after a 4 hr flight. Sheets were stained.  No circulation in room.  Window AC vibrated so bad couldn't use it. No labels in kitchen for food.  No place to sit and eat food other than in bedroom. Only one bath mat for all 4 rooms to share. No wash cloth provided.  Would have brought my own if I would have been told.  Would have been nice to have mirror in room to do hair and makeup.,Bed was comfortable. Location was good for food choices. Lots of food places deliver.

Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Daniel,United Kingdom,1 review,May 14  2017,5.0,The neighbourhood wasn't  the best and there was a shooting just down the street from the property on the night we arrived. I wasn't keen on the fact there are no staff and you just get emailed a code for the door before you arrive.The room was too small for 2 people,This was the cheapest accommodation I could find that was with a reasonable distance to the city centre. Turns out there was a big conference on the dates we were there so everywhere had hiked up there price apart from this placer.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Kaitlen,Canada,2 Reviews,May 8  2017,6.7,No parking might make it tough during weekday stays. Weekend travellers are more likely to get lucky. we parked right outside the front door.  Found it to be really expensive for what you were getting.,the location was decent. about a 10 minute walk to a train stop to get into downtown boston.the bus stops are all right outside the property.Close to food and bars.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Kathrine,United States of America,1 review,May 5  2017,6.7,The bank beds were metal and very noisy. I would fully wake up every time I turned over.

Good value for your money compared to other options in the Southie.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Katia,Switzerland,78 Reviews,May 3  2017,9.2,A common area a bit bigger with table(s) would be appreciated,Very nice house in a great place with restaurants. shops and public transportation.

Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Kedar,Netherlands,8 Reviews,May 2  2017,3.3,There was continuous WATER LEAKAGE from the floor in the room possibly from adjacent bathroom/toilet (so gross....). When I asked the property manager to give us another room. they mentioned they are aware of the issue and told us to use an extra towel from laundry to soak up water. Not professional at all.We arrived in the morning and there was NO HOT WATER in any of the shared bathrooms. contacted the property manager in the afternoon. was not fixed until night.,Kitchen has all the utilities to cook. though we did not use it. Laundry facility available in the building. which we did not use either.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Jakub,United Kingdom,1 review,April 27  2017,4.2,The room was ridiculously tiny. and there is no communal area to sit whatsoever. There is a kitchen in which you can stand. unless others want to use it. Then you can't cause it's too small for more than 2-3 people tops. The most absurd thing was that our friends. solo travellers who also stayed there. both had bigger room than ours (supposedly for two). We literally couldn't walk around the bed - there was maybe half a foot between it and three walls - and one of us would have to leave the room or sit on the bed if the other person was to pack a bag. change clothes etc. I contacted them to ask for a room swap. they replied all rooms were the same size - a blatant lie. I've been to all 6 rooms on our floor as we knew all ppl staying there. Doing so I found out there was an even smaller room with a bunk bed. which also got allocated to a couple somehow.Price may seem good but it's not worth it.,It's cheap. for Boston. but overpriced for what it is. Bus around the corner. Lots of cashpoints and Citizens Bank doesn't charge a fee on UK cards (very rare in the US).
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Emily,United States of America,1 review,April 27  2017,5.4,A simple curtain would help muffle sound. help control temperature. and provide a dark environment for optimal sleep.  I think a curtain panel can cost around $20.00.  To summarize.Curtain panel: $20.00A bad review on booking.com: Move the decimal and add some commas to the amount shown above. I also went to take a shower and the hot water was gone (I ran the shower for 5 minutes before giving up that hot water was not coming.)   Luckily I was able to snag a shower the next day. but would have really liked one that night to help unwind.  Overall. it was lacking in comfort.,I called to get my room code because the one in the email didn't work.  The guy I talked to was very. very friendly.  So A+ for customer service.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Keren Miers,Japan,11 Reviews,April 26  2017,6.7,The room had not been cleaned by the advertised 16:00 check in time. One phone call fixed that.There was no hot water to the building on the first night. Again another phone call to get the hot water flowing again.The room at the front of the building was a bit stuffy and warm for sleeping. No fan or ventilation. only some small windows. But open windows let in noise from the busy bar right across the street.A common room with a dining table would be an ideal place to eat meals cooked in the kitchen.,The well equipped kitchen and washer dryer combo. And the shops and restaurants close by.Good access by bus to the downtown. Walking distance to some of the local attractions. E.g. Boston Tea Party.As guessed. the property was full of Boston Marathon runners. Very social atmosphere.

Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,David,United Kingdom,1 review,April 18  2017,10,The kitchen could have been bigger. And the staff were a little too zealous about cleaning out the fridge - even throwing away a lot of clearly fresh food.,Quarters on DOT balanced the privacy of a hotel room with the affordability of a hostel. The rooms were new. clean and well provisioned. the public transport was accessible and the information provided by the hosts about the local area was extensive.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Robin,New Zealand,2 Reviews,April 18  2017,7.5,Some difficulty contacting them to extend my stay but eventually resolved over the phone.,Very convenient and well priced. All required facilities were available for a no fuss stay in Boston. Close to public transport and within pleasant walking distance to downtown.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Emma,United Kingdom,1 review,April 13  2017,5.0,No communal areas - small kitchen that is nowhere near as big as in the photos. Shared areas reasonably clean. but the fridge could've been cleaned. Noisy road and bar outside. thin walls mean you can hear everything. including noisy co-tenants who decided to cook at 4am.,Some rooms tiny - luckily I had one of the larger rooms so was able to put my suitcase on the floor. The heating broke one night and it was freezing with no showers the next morning. the staff did respond quickly and it got fixed by the afternoon. but as there is no one on site it is difficult to get hold of anyone if you have any problems (staff did respond fairly quickly by email during the day. but some people tried to phone the maintenance number and just got voicemail). The location is ok. easy to get to town but limited choices for food and drink nearby. Boston is extremely expensive. which explains the high price of the accommodation. so it was relatively ok but  still expensive for what you got.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Kurt,Belgium,24 Reviews,April 12  2017,7.1,The front rooms face a bar which can be quite  loud on Friday and Saturday nights. A bit of a stretch from the city centre. Kitchen is too small to eat. but we only had 1 chair in the room.,Area has several nice bars and restaurants. rooms are clean enough and the beds are fine.  Kitchen is pretty small but well equipped. Decent enough for the price.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anonymous,United Kingdom,115 Reviews,April 12  2017,5.8,Well. this place really disappointed me. They cancelled my reservation just before I board my flight to Boston from the UK. they didn't respond or clarify and I had to speak to Booking.com. asked me several times to update my card details. very frustrating. They told me to take a taxi and it will cost 10$ but it was more than 20$. I arrived there and there is no reception and the door was locked. I had to call from the barber next door to speak with them. and they provided me with entrance and room codes. absolutely hectic and unprofessional. The room was fine with shared bathroom. you can hear everything in the hallway and people walking. noisy. The next day I woke up and there was no hot water. tried for some time but nothing came and I had to leave without a shower. They don't have baggage storage. they told me after I checked out that I could leave it in the hallway on my responsibiliy. I had to take it with me and pay another hotel to store it for me. It's far from the downtown. you need to take a bus which take 20-25 min to the downtown. Absolute hassle and confucsion. slow staff on the phone and nothing to make me happy about this place. just a shelter to sleep at. nothing more. Very disappointed.,A place to sleep only. don't expect much.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Phillip,Netherlands,15 Reviews,April 10  2017,5.8,Right across the street from a bar that can be quite loud. especially on the weekend. though generally tolerable during the week. Shared thermostat for the entire floor can make temperature regulation challenging. My sheets had a black stain (i.e. dirty but not disgusting) on them that made me feel like I was sleeping in an unclean bed. The mattress also felt like a gel insole. which can much harder on your back than you expect.Most importantly: this is a short-term rental and not a hotel. Unless you bump into the cleaning staff (for communal areas) during the day. you won't ever meet anybody because you're sent your access codes via email. As such. your room will not be cleaned while you're there and you will probably never see any staff.Your credit card will also be nearly immediately charged for the whole amount. though if you cancel during Booking.com's free cancellation period. they will also refund that very quickly (the same group runs the West Broadway Quarters).,Cheap by Boston standards and shared kitchen is a good way to save money on meals for longer stays. Shared bathrooms can be a drag. but there were enough of them and they were kept clean.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Jgox,Saudi Arabia,3 Reviews,April 8  2017,6.3,You can hear noises outside your room and when somebody's using the shower.

Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Ben,United Kingdom,1 review,March 25  2017,6.3,The room itself was a touch basic and could probably have a couple of extra furnishings (eg a mirror. a coat hook). I also found my bedding to be dirty (muddy mark on the sheet and some staining on the pillowcases).,Had everything I needed and the location was handy (10 minute walk to the subway. with numerous bus stops nearby. Uber from the airport cost around $15-20. multiple cafes. gyms. and stores within close proximity) The bathroom in particular was very good. with shampoo's being provided. a good shower unit. and despite being shared it was always available. The use of keycodes rather than keys was also handy. and the operator provided a folder with many guides and tips about the local area and Boston itself. The wifi worked very well and the other guests staying were civil and polite.

And while there was a shared bathroom. it wasn't connected to the room itself.  Be prepared for that if you have a room ending with a 1 on it.,The location was ok.  You could walk to certain areas of Boston within 30 minutes. and there were restaurants around the area to choose from if you didn't want to go too far or use the kitchen.  There may not be staff. but the hotel was clean.

Also the bed was uncomfortable and noisy when you moved in it.Other guests were loud at night and one even took a long shower after midnight in the bathroom next to us which made us feel like we were in the jungle.In our last night there was a storm outside and you could hear the wind blowing loudly. Due to the wind the temperature in our room sank and we couldn't regulate the temperature on our own. So we were basically freezing the whole night.,The hostel was close to the Dorchester Heights from where you get an amazing view over Boston.The kitchen has everything you need for a short stay.

We were in  a room facing the street. This is not the hotel's fault. but future patrons may appreciate knowing this.  Also. there was no dining area. so patrons have to eat in their rooms.,It was clean. basic amenities. good kitchen and laundry facilities. easy to access. close to buses and downtown. close to good restaurants and grocery stores. safe. staff was conscientious. affordable price
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Alexandra,United States of America,1 review,December 21  2016,9.6,We only had one towel per person for three days. it would've been great to have fresh ones.,Excellent location; loved the facilities; kitchen was beautiful but we didn't use it; people in it were nice too.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Bud,Germany,1 review,November 16  2016,6.0,Very small room. No chance to park in the area. We had to move our vehicle several times a day. Boston with a car is a mess. 20min parking 15 $ ...,New rooms though very small.Campared to Boston prices fair.Best is the sports bar with a nice choice of beers across the street and very nice food with reasonable prices.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Robert,Canada,3 Reviews,November 15  2016,4.6,Unfortunately the soundproofing was woefully inadequate.The unit #101 assigned faced the street.  You could hear people walking by on the pavement. people chatting. singing. cars/trucks rumbling by. Yes. it was unusual.I was restless until 3-4am the first night and learnt to sleep with the noise in subsequent days.,The room was clean and tidy. the instructions were perfect. the correspondence was prompt.Loved the location. enjoyed the neighbourhood and appreciated all the tips in the Handbook in the room.

Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Rachel,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,October 31  2016,6.7,room was tiny.  hardly room for our case.  stairs were steep.,we gained access by key code so didn't meet any staff.  the kitchen was excellent and the shared bathrooms clean.  good bus service into city.  all very easy to find.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,S,Canada,1 review,October 31  2016,6.7,A bit far out of the city center. And it's noisy. We had some people staying across from us who had no respect for anyone. Yelling and banging doors all night and into the early morning. Not the hostel's fault. but the building has very little sound proofing. And as a result. we were running of fumes because of our lack of sleep.,Rooms were very clean and everything was practically new. Really liked staying in a Southie neighborhood. Liked how easy the codes were to use; keyless entry was awesome. Very nice hostel.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Katharina,Germany,2 Reviews,October 30  2016,4.2,The hostel is directly opposite a pub/sports bar. So it´s very loud in the evening and at night despite closed windows. The room is very small. You don´t have any parking possibilities. Next parking garage is 20 minutes away.,N/A
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Bryan,Canada,2 Reviews,October 17  2016,6.7,Three words for you: bring ear plugs. Not for the other guests. but for the traffic (you're near a noisy intersection) and the bar across the street. The walls transmit noise from outside almost perfectly. and I was able to hear conversations clearly with the windows closed.This is made worse by the fact that this bar (known as "Stats") seems to attract the loudest. most obnoxious Bostonians possible. I actually heard a group of dudebros screaming "THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN. YEAH. YEAH. THE BOYS ARE BAAAACK!!" And Massachusetts drivers really are as aggressive as you've heard; horns honk at the slightest provocation. which will be transmitted perfectly through the walls if you're on a room facing the street like we were. And the desire of many drivers to have you hear their music as clearly as possible doesn't help either.So. if you're going to be out and about and not returning to your room any time before 2:30 am. you won't run into any problems. If you go to bed a bit earlier. then you're going to have a bad time.,This spot is very affordable. and the other guests were all polite. respectful. and kind. The kitchen was well equipped. and the shared bathrooms were clean and did the job that they needed to. The Internet was fast and had only one hiccup over nine days. which is great for a hotel! There are great coffee shops and restaurants located nearby. as well as a reasonable walk to the waterfront and the Broadway Red Line station.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Anonymous,Austria,6 Reviews,October 13  2016,8.0,The room was tiny. There were no hooks for the damp towels. No shelves even though there would have been space on the walls.It was very very loud. even when the windows were closed. The bar across the street was noisy. The doors of the other rooms were very loud too. The next metro station is far. but uber worked very well and is cheap in Boston.,The room was pretty and modern. The kitchen was well equipped. Washing machine and dryer were fast and efficient. There was plenty of soap. shampoo and conditioner. The email and the door codes worked well.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Jodie,United Kingdom,10 Reviews,October 10  2016,7.5,The location wasn't the best but the accommodation was close to a train stop so it was easy enough to get around. We were travelling as couple and requested a double room upon booking. When we arrived we had a bunk bed room which wasn't ideal and not what we asked for when we booked. It would have been better to know in advance which type of room we were receiving since we requested and paid under the title of "double room".,The rooms and bathroom were very clean and comfortable and the free wifi and TV were great.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Jason,Australia,8 Reviews,September 29  2016,7.0,I got given a bunk room when I had booked a double and there was a lot of noise from the bar across the road on the weekend. There were also no coat hangers or iron which is inconvenient on a business trip.,The location was a comfortable walk to the convention centre and there are lots of bars and restaurants in the local area.
Quarters on DOT by Short Term Rentals Boston,Colin,Australia,87 Reviews,September 27  2016,6.3,No metro station nearby. If you want to go downtown. you need to take bus then metro. If you are driving like we did. it is not going to be easy to find a ligit car park on the streets nearby (without a locals permit).Also it can be noisy if your room is facing main street as there is a busy pub right opposite. No staff on site to deal with the sudden blackout of our room. fortunately the cleaner came and she was nice enough for me to use her phone to contact maintence first but no answer. then ringing admin and got instruction to locate switchboard and flipped the switch back. Wouldn't know what to do without able to borrow a phone otherwise.,Location not too far away from downtown. TV has Netflex.

Close to the City attractions. clean and good value.
102 Chandler Street by Lyon Apartments,Gerhild,United States of America,2 Reviews,October 25  2016,8.3,The place could use a legible number on the outside door. a lockbox that isn't impossible to open for anyone except Mario. The apartment could use some reading lamps. and also a lighter or matches to use the gas stove. Other than that. all was well.,Even though I had trouble finding and getting into the place. once I located MARIO. he was great in meeting me. getting me settled. giving me invaluable tips about where and when to park the car etc. Very friendly helpful person.

Taylor House Bed and Breakfast,Elizabeth,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,October 31  2017,8.8,Just a little bit of work needing doing on our room but there was nothing I disliked.  Sitting on the porch in the sun was lovely.,The breakfasts were excellent. different items every day.  The room was spacious. ours needed a little bit of work doing.  Slightly out of Boston but public transport was good and the choice of local restaurants was very fine.
Taylor House Bed and Breakfast,David,United States of America,23 Reviews,October 19  2017,8.3,Safe neighborhood in transition. A little scruffy. especially day before trash pickup. Would have liked traditional home made breakfast.,Lovely old house. Nice. helpful hosts. Great ‘ethnic’ restaurants nearby. Convenient parking.
Taylor House Bed and Breakfast,Christine,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,September 12  2017,7.9,The place had no warm atmosphere. also there wasn't a communal area for guests to relax; guests just kept to their own bedroom.  The place felt like a hostel rather than a B&amp;B; they also rent out the house next door and the guests from there eat their breakfast at Taylor House too. We had arrived late evening and our key was left under the doormat for us. this would have been ok if we had seen it immediately but it took a few minutes of panicking at the door thinking we couldn't get in - the owners were away that weekend at a wedding and nobody was there to answer the door. We finally noticed a note pinned to the door but the doorway was poorly lit and in our panic we hadn't noticed it at first. This was all totally unnecessary as we had previously notified the owners of our flight's arrival time (by email). and they could have told us they weren't going to be there (it was a wedding! They must have known about it for ages!) and they should have explained about the entry procedure when they responded to our email ......Although Juan was friendly the owner was brusque. didn't reply when I wished him good morning and actually  looked like he was in a bad mood! (Maybe he had a hangover from the wedding!)The house is nice; it's large and airy and in its day would have been a wonderful home. All things considered. I would describe our stay there as Fair. as we were a little disappointed with our experience due to the atmosphere. We had stayed at four B&amp;B's during this holiday and this one was our least favourite :(,Breakfast was delicious and varied each morning. The fresh fruit was particularly tasty and the cooked breakfast was excellent!
Taylor House Bed and Breakfast,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,September 8  2017,7.9,The breakfast could have been better. We expected more choices of freshly prepared dishes at a bed and breakfast.,Enjoyed staying at this house. It is clean and comfortable and located in a very nice community. Felt safe there. Comfortable bed!
Taylor House Bed and Breakfast,Gayle,United States of America,3 Reviews,July 10  2017,8.3,The bathroom was very small - but workable.,The location is beautiful - situated among Victorian homes and a friendly neighborhood atmosphere. Nice walk to the Boston T and from there a convenient trip to downtown. Breakfast was exceptional - especially Friday's. Our mattress was brand new and very comfortable. Accommodations were very quiet.
Taylor House Bed and Breakfast,Mike,United States of America,1 review,July 4  2017,7.1,We only got clean towels two of our five days. Other than breakfast. the staff was rarely around to meet and greet. The home was sparsely populated with period-correct furniture. There were no chairs on the porch. The home was not nearly as close to downtown Boston as we were led to believe in the literature.,Bed was super comfortable. The exterior of property was nicely done. Breakfast was good. but would've preferred more low-carb. low-fat choices.
Taylor House Bed and Breakfast,Arjen Jeninga,Netherlands,15 Reviews,June 26  2017,7.1,The house looks a bit neglected and at the same time has so much potential. That's really a pity. The house needs the attention the garden gets.,It is a beautiful house. The staf (Jose) and Gerard are kind and the breakfast is great. Especially the cakes and pies that Gerard prepares. That lights up the place. Parking is great. location excellent.
Taylor House Bed and Breakfast,Nancy,United States of America,1 review,May 23  2017,3.8,The room decor was good. for the period of the home!  The bed sagged in the middle. so I struggled to stay on my side! Piles of cords next to the tv. dirty bathroom ceiling fan. dust on all the wood work in the bathroom and the cabinet above the toilet was dirty on the outside. The window sills in bedroom had dust and cheap rods above the windows. Sheets had stains and black short hairs. I think they have a dog! We went down for breakfast at 9:30. there weren't any coffee cups. most of the breakfast food was gone. it looked like a bunch of leftovers on the counter! When we mentioned to the lady that was cleaning about the cups. she told the owner and as we came into the room he said. "all they had to do was ask! " We never even saw one person working the place until the moment I asked about the cups! Did I mention the kid that checked us in? Super nice. but met us in gym cloths and had us pay before we even checked in!  I'm being rated a 3.8 out of five! Too high!,Location was excellent. easy walk to a small down town!
Taylor House Bed and Breakfast,Linda,United States of America,1 review,May 18  2017,9.2,A second hot option at breakfast would have been nice. But they did have plenty of other options.,A beautiful older property. very well maintained. Bathroom well updated.
Taylor House Bed and Breakfast,Dayyat,United States of America,2 Reviews,May 13  2017,10,More counter space in bathroom would have been nice. Perhaps a small table or cabinet next to the sink? That would have also provided room for a box of kleenex in bathroom.,Breakfast was delicious with lots of choices. Coffee was great! A small kitchenette down from our room had tea and coffee and small fridge to put stuff in. Had a nice cup of herbal tea before bed. Bathroom was very clean. shower was nice. Towels nice and fluffy!  Dave. the owner. was wonderfully nice and helpful. gave us a map of the area. told us about lots of interesting things to do. He also told us the history of the house. Local town of Jamaica Plains was charming with lots of interesting shops. We spent alot of time walking around. Never did make it to the trolley tour of Boston. but didn't really miss it!

Double bed mattress makes a lot of noise asyou move during the night. Sofabed metal rails are bent preventing easeof deployment. Stowing sofa bed is even more difficult.

Parking is $25.00 per night you stay not each day and this isn't clear on the website. I did find street parking during the day but not when I returned in the early evening. Not many food choices nearby so bring food.,The room was nice. updated style with microwave.fridge and coffee maker. always a bonus. The TV was nice. I had a corner room which may have been larger. There is a nice park behind the hotel where you can walk or jog.

enVision Hotel Boston - Longwood, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member,Kevin R.,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,August 9  2017,9.2,Without a breakfast included. a few biscuits to go with the complimentary coffee would have been nice. Bathtub curtains long enough to avoid spill would be appreciated.,The bed was really comfortable. The shower curtain surrounding the bathtub was too short and caused quite some spill in the bathroom. The hotel is located right beside public transportation heading straight downtown (although it does take ~30min). Staff is friendly. Breakfast was not included but free bottled water and coffee was available in the room. along with a microwave and fridge. Satisfied overall!

We purchased a small fan and put it on the nightstand and it was able to drown out most of the noise.,The room and bathroom were great. very nice and clean!!

enVision Hotel Boston - Longwood, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member,Mohammad,Netherlands,13 Reviews,April 28  2017,5.4,We checked in at midnight and we got the last room available which was facing towards the main entrance and every five minutes we could hear a tran passing by. so if you're sensitive to noise make sure you get a room not facing the streets. The hotel has a small selection of breakfast items. The location is quite far out from the main attractions in Boston. Overall quite expensive for what you get. although it seems hotels in Boston are expensive even compared it to New York.,N/A

enVision Hotel Boston - Longwood, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member,Adrian,United States of America,1 review,January 21  2017,9.6,The neighborhood I had to walk through looked a little sketchy at night but wasn't that bad. It is Boston after all.,I stayed here 1 night because my wife was at Brigham Women's Hospital. It's about a 10-15 minute walk to the Longwood medical area. Neighborhood I had to walk through to get there was a little sketchy but it looks like there's a lot of revitalization and remodeling going on around the hotel. The hotel was better than expected and was the least expensive option in the immediate area. Room was clean and modern. shower was hot and had good pressure and the bed was comfortable.

Alongside the great service the room and general cleanliness of the hotel was exceptional. Wi-Fi (complimentary) - excellent had no issues at all.

enVision Hotel Boston - Longwood, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member,Patricia,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 15  2016,8.8,There was no light over the shower so we didn't feel comfortable taking a shower at night.

We sat in the lounge and chatted with Dana the manager on our second night. in between his taking care of guests. and had a very enjoyable evening in the comfortable  lounge area. The bathroom was very clean as was the rest of the room. Valet parking was very convenient and they had the car ready most of the time before I got downstairs. I was visiting the Isabel Gardner Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts and picked the hotel because its location was very convenient to these sites. The drive to Copley Place. the Prudential Center. and Boston Common was relatively quick. We also found good restaurants nearby that didn't cost an arm and a leg.

Immediate area is a little run down but there are signs of renewal. did not feel unsafe at night but little pedestrian activity.  You'll feel the trolley rumbling by until about 1 am - quiet after that.  Staff were mixed - some friendly. some pretty aloof.,Easy access to Longwood medical area. Museum of Fine Arts. Symphony and downtown via Green Line trolley - Heath St. branch. which stops right in front of hotel.  VA Hospital right up the street. easy walk.  Adjacent to nice park with walking trails.  Nicely renovated building.  Pretty good value for price considering exorbitant Boston hotel rates.  Valet parking available but adequate and free street parking looked available also. a rarity in Boston.  No breakfast provided. but fresh pastries. yogurt. cereal. coffee and juice available à la carte.  Would go back without hesitation.

Right next to a stop on the green line of the T tube network. which takes you straight into town in 15 minutes.

Two-Bedroom on Western Avenue Apt N301,Angell,United States of America,12 Reviews,May 15  2017,6.3,The check in location is in a different place than the apartment you are staying. it's the next building. If you have a lot of luggages. that will be a big issue. The apartment  is really out of nowhere. the address is not even on the Google map. There are times that Uber or taxi drivers can't find the location and one time the Uber driver had a hard time to find me after a few tries. the driver just cancelled my trip. It will cost you around $15 one way to the back bay. There is only a 7/11. a gas station. a pizza place and Dunkin' Donuts near by. There is nothing around or in the walking distance. The apartment is on the third floor with big windows. very bright during the day and noisy all day. The big windows are very thin and the apartment is on the busy street conner. it is very. very noisy. Starting from around 6am til night. there are buses. cars and trucks sound and they are so loud. Can't sleep. The curtains are those cheap mini blinds and it doesn't block the light at all.  My 19 years old teenager son needs an eye cover to sleep. The room temperature control has its own mind.  It doesn't work most of the time.  If you sleep in the small bedroom the heat or cold air will blow directly onto your face.  We just have to turned it off altogether.The shower curtain is too short.  In one of the bathrooms. the shower curtain has only two third of the plastic cover and you get water on the floor every time you use the shower. The shower water pressure is very weak.  One of the bathrooms' shower faucet doesn't hold. so the water will get hotter and hotter while you shower.When the check out time is really the check out time. there is no place to store your luggages.This apartment is built for rental. not for owner occupied.,The size and the cleanness. The kitchen has everything you need if you like to cook. Everything seams very new.  Washing machine is very useful.

One-Bedroom on Boylston Street Apt 10,sam_84,Italy,9 Reviews,August 13  2016,8.3,There were some issues in locating the entrance to the building (caused by it sharing the address with a restaurant...). there was no "welcome book" with instructions about - say - the cleaning or how to dispose of the garbage. All the windows of the living room/kitchen are right on a construction site. so lights and noises 24/7. but I believe it's temporary.,The flat was great and well equipped with everything (even filters. coffee. tea and sugar for the coffee machine). the staff responsive and kind. location almost perfect.
One-Bedroom on Boylston Street Apt 10,Tracilikestravel,United States of America,15 Reviews,July 19  2016,9.2,Sofa/Futon was not very comfortable. but with lots of pillows we made do. Construction on building next door (won't last forever!) made sleeping in impossible. Just ask if it is still going on if you are a late sleeper. (past 7:30 am),A self contained apartment in a very convenient location. Easy to walk or T to everything. Plenty of room and nice kitchen facilities. Bed was very comfortable and everything was clean. Great price for the city and location. Right across the street from Boston Commons and across the Park is Beacon Hill. BTW - if you stay on 7th floor - unit is off elevator and left through the door down the hall! Lady across from the elevator is not your apartment!! LOL!

Two-Bedroom on Washington Street Apt 403,Kellie,United Kingdom,23 Reviews,June 15  2017,6.3,Unfortunately the accommodation appears to be right by a hot spot for drug dealers. which resulted in us not feeling safe at times.The accommodation also isn't insulated. so you can clearly hear the conversations and foot steps coming from the adjoining apartments.,...however. the accommodation is located centrally and it's very easy to get around to all the key sights from here.

The handle on the dresser broke off with first touch as it was not assembled correctly. And forget about using the lift. Doesn't work at all and when I asked someone who lived there they said it has never worked so be prepared to walk up 3 stories. Oh. and I checked in on the night of the first presidential debate and the TV/Cable was not working. When I asked I was told TV was not included and that I should just stream via my laptop.

It was a minimalist apartment which is fine. except one can't discount comfort.,Great location. Nice kitchenette. Bed was ok. The Sonder people were helpful and quick to respond to our questions.
One-Bedroom on Arch Street Apt 5A,Robin,United States of America,1 review,September 17  2017,9.5,There were a couple of very LARGE cockroaches that came out one night.  Wasn't exactly sure what they were at first due to their size.  But it's an old building. so it wasn't a surprise.   I'm from California where they don't grow as large.  The bathroom tile floor was broken and a hand rail should definitely be installed in the shower. (along with a shelf to place your bath products on.) LOTS of street noise during the night and early morning.,Exceptionally clean and right in the middle of Boston.  Easy to get around on foot anywhere from the apartment.  Very comfortable bed.  It was a really nice place and I would come back.

XV Beacon Hotel,Linda,United States of America,1 review,July 6  2017,9.6,I booked this hotel because the online description of the roof top viewing for the July 4th fireworks was very inviting.  Honestly. the event was a bust.  People assembled with coolers loaded with alcohol and many were drunk before the fireworks display began.  The TV coverage was intermittent and buzzing - but who could see the TV with everyone standing?  Why were all the seats removed?  I thought the space would have the chairs. tables and lounges and there would be a barbecue or snacks for the guests.  Really - what is the purpose of apples in a bowl on every floor?  And 3 little dishes lined up with 3 paper clips?  And why espresso coffee instead of American coffee?,All staff were happy. courteous and helpful - the bellhops. driver (Paul). reception desk staff and concierge were professional and pleasant. It was nice to have Paul drive us to Long Wharf for our evening boat ride.The concierge helped us pick a terrific restaurant for dinner afterwards in Little Italy.A nice treat was the slice of chocolate cake and plate of cookies that were delivered to our room for my sweetheart's birthday - he'll be 74 on Saturday - and that's why we went to Boston to celebrate.
XV Beacon Hotel,Sharon,United States of America,1 review,June 26  2017,9.6,I have been to boutique hotels before both in the US and in Europe.  This hotel very much reminded me of our European stays.  The rooms were a bit smaller than I pictured for a US hotel of this expense.  I booked this for the 2 of us. but the room is really set up for either one person or a married couple.  The bathroom had one sink and was more suited for one person at a time - again. not a problem for a married couple perhaps but tricky with 2 women!  Very European in its flavor.  So Americans. just know the rooms might be smaller than you are used to. especially for the price.,I booked XV Beacon as a celebration for my sister's 50th birthday.  SHE was wowed at the ambiance and the character of the hotel.  I was so glad!  Great surprise for her.The bed was super comfortable. the location is incredible to be able to walk to so many sights and restaurants. the staff unbelievably kind and helpful. and we even got door to door free service in the hotel shuttle to our choice of restaurant for dinner (thank you SO much. Mark!)  I would highly recommend XV Beacon especially to tourists for the location but also for locals if you would like a fun location to re-connect with Boston!
XV Beacon Hotel,Mauro,Italy,6 Reviews,May 16  2017,10,N/A,Fifteen Beacon is a beautiful. charming and "warm feeling" hotel. Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful. The concierge service is simply fantastic: among other things. they booked us the Celtics-Bulls playoff game the day of the game! I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Boston. Finally. the annex restaurant Moo is superb both for dinner and lunch and for amazing breakfasts!
XV Beacon Hotel,Christopher,United States of America,1 review,March 10  2017,9.6,I honestly can't think of anything that could make the trip better. We can't wait to come visit Beacon again.,The jet tub was a plus. It was like a mini spa session and very relaxing. The bed was amazing. The staff was more than helpful and the entire hotel was clean and welcoming from the time we pulled up until our departure.

XV Beacon Hotel,Laure,United States of America,28 Reviews,August 6  2016,9.2,The fireplace pilot lets out some heat which seems to affect the AC efficiency.  Didn't have connecting rooms although I had specifically requested them.  I recognize this is a problem more often than not in most hotels.,A very luxurious feeling. great shower. toiletries and bedding.Great restaurant next door. although extremely expensive.
XV Beacon Hotel,Sandra,United States of America,16 Reviews,July 27  2016,10,Unfortunately one of the elevators was not working but it really wasn't a problem.  It is really cool that the elevators are so vintage such that parts must be tooled just for them.,This hotel is awesome!  It only has 60 some odd rooms so you really feel like a guest. They know who you are and are very accommodating. We had a wonderful driver with the house car who took us everywhere we needed or wanted to go and they helped us with excellent dinner choices. The best address in Boston!
XV Beacon Hotel,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,June 20  2016,4.6,The description had nothing to do with reality. I was hoping for a traditional Bostonian classic and all it was was a very overpriced corporate hotel. No charm. no character. no personality. A piddly little gym. a roof terrace which was surrounded by noisy and unsightful air ducts. I could have literally high fived the neighboring building's wall from my bedroom and the air duct which was on the roof terrace also passed by my bedroom wall.,N/A

Luxury Apartments in Watermark Seaport near BCEC by LYX Suites,Paul,United Kingdom,24 Reviews,September 26  2017,4.6,The room and bathroom was very dirty with dust. oven and microwave dirty. The 3rd bed was chair which converted to bed. This accommodation is not for more than 2 people. Internet and tv were not working. Contacted LYX very poor response. Have contacted them since returning and requested a refund still waiting. Beware of the $99 cleaning charge. this is a money making exercise. room was not clean.,The receptionist on entry into the shared accommodation block. The entry area was very smart along with the lifts and also the roof space which had shared BBQ.
Luxury Apartments in Watermark Seaport near BCEC by LYX Suites,Chris,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,June 25  2017,10,A few instructions regarding the heating/cooling controls would be nice and instructions regardingmaking up the sofa bed and where extra linen is stored. Perhaps obvious to some but this did cause a little consternation for a short while. The entry system takes a little working out SO would suggest written instructions are included in the KEY envelope also.,The Reception staff were VERY pleasant and helpful. Nothing was to much trouble for them.Location was totally amazing. a very short walk to the city itself.The Seaport area is VERY up and coming. with a very modern and forward think atmosphere.The underground to/from the airport is merely yards away from the property.There was a room off Reception that you can leave luggage prior to the apartment being ready and on the day of departure if you have a later flight.The facilities onsite. for all to use are first class although it has to be said that most of the residentsare 20 somethings which in fairness was something we very much liked.GREAT gym and chill out area on the 2nd floor for all to use and a huge roof terrace on the Roof.Press R in two of the 3 lifts only.Don't be put off by this though. all were extremely nice and courteous. Apartments can be around$6000 a month to rent so NO riff raff here...period.The view towards the bay FROM the apartment itself is a side view with an office block opposite although this didn't bother us in the slightest.Also. please be aware that the "apartment" isn't an apartment. as in loads of rooms and such.Its a larger than average "hotel room" with the added bonus of washer and dryer and FULL kitchen facilities. NEVER did work our how the freezer kept making all those ice cubes.
Luxury Apartments in Watermark Seaport near BCEC by LYX Suites,Jean,United Kingdom,17 Reviews,June 7  2017,7.9,Just a pity that our air conditioning wasn't efficient and wasn't attended to when reported.,The location was very good.

Luxury Apartments in Watermark Seaport near BCEC by LYX Suites,Fachele,United States of America,1 review,June 3  2017,8.3,I chose this place for my friends and I to get ready for prom since we all wanted to get ready together. We were all colored students and a lot of my friends complained to me about how they were very uncomfortable with how the other white folks stared at them while they were on the roof top. They eventually left the roof top and went back to the room. I noticed it myself when I entered the second floor with some of my friends to get coffee and we received some hardcore stares like we didn't belong. Although. this didn't go for everyone. Some of the other folks were very nice with really cute and nice dogs. We're young kids. I just wished that my friends could've fully enjoyed this place comfortably considering the price I paid for one night.,N/A
Luxury Apartments in Watermark Seaport near BCEC by LYX Suites,Sheilagh,United Kingdom,15 Reviews,May 27  2017,5.8,Possibly the most uncomfortable "sofa bed" I've ever slept on. The roof space featured on your website didn't  actually exist at the time of our visit &amp; was one of the main reasons we booked it. There were 2 barbecues outside on floor 2 which had people queuing to use them. Not at all like the facilities advertised on bookings.com. Additionally our so called "view" was of a busy car park.,Conveniently located for sight seeing. restaurants. transport &amp; harbour
Luxury Apartments in Watermark Seaport near BCEC by LYX Suites,John,United Kingdom,1 review,March 24  2017,10,Was unaware that the apartment was on a transit line direct from the airport so took a cab at almost 9 x the cost of the silverline transit to Courthouse. Booking involved full payment then the automated system demanded an additional deposit so I have overpaid. As no LYX person on site and as I did not have laptop I could not contact to rectify. Now have to retrospectively sort.,Was perfect for our needs and within easy walking to exhibition centre and downtown. Plenty eateries close by in what is an aspiring area. Downside is that there are several large scale construction works close by but not detrimental to stay.Very friendly city. moreso than NY but wind can be bitterly cold when blowing.

Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Harbor on Tudor Wharf,Esther,United States of America,1 review,February 26  2017,8.3,There was no milk in the little "store" off the lobby.

Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Harbor on Tudor Wharf,Keith,United States of America,1 review,January 3  2017,10,Slightly better options to park. but that's the nature of staying in such a populated area.,The hot breakfast included was spectacular.The hot tub felt amazing after a long day of walking Boston.The kitchenette was convenient.The location was great.The price was spot on.
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Harbor on Tudor Wharf,Dave,United States of America,2 Reviews,January 1  2017,8.3,The pool is on the smaller side.

Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Harbor on Tudor Wharf,Lacey,United States of America,2 Reviews,November 1  2016,9.6,Parking is always costly in cities.,The breakfast was amazing. normally hotels that tend to be a little pricey do not offer free breakfast this place did and it was loaded with options.

Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Harbor on Tudor Wharf,Jennifer,United Kingdom,12 Reviews,October 31  2016,7.5,Staying 7 nights means you pay that room rate but don't always get the same housekeeping as 1 or 2 nights in that things were not replenished and the sheets on the pull out bed not changed at all,The hotel is good for a couple and teenager and the views from the hotel were good.The location near North Station.the freedom trail and near to a good supermarket at Bunker Hill worked well.All of the staff at breakfast were efficient and friendly

Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Harbor on Tudor Wharf,Robert,Australia,40 Reviews,September 20  2016,8.8,It is a fair hike across the bridge into the city. and it is hard to find a decent restaurant nearby. You really need a car to get about. or penetrate the mysteries of the local buses. However there is a city bike station right next to the hotel - very simple to use; and it's only a short walk to visit the USS Constitution.,We stayed in a very nice I bed apartment with a kitchenette. very comfortable and you could cook if you want to. There was a massive tv in each room and the free WiFi was simple to access and effective. The breakfast was very good and included muesli. A very well run hotel with excellent staff. It's right on the heritage freedom trail. We had fantastic views and the public areas are excellent. there's an outside terrace.
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Harbor on Tudor Wharf,Fisher,United States of America,1 review,September 15  2016,7.1,We definitely got the "ha-ha" room.  (1) My spouse complained that the bed sagged in the middle.(2)  The shower no matter what we did flooded the area outside the tub nearest the faucets.  We suspect that this problem was of some duration because paint was peeling from the bottom of the bathroom door which my spouse believed was warped from having been repeatedly dampened. (3) When we arrived the blinds on the window had a huge stain that it took the house maintenance staffer fifteen minutes to scrub off.  The front desk duty person offered to move us to another room which we declined.  Perhaps in retrospect  we should have graciously accepted her offer but since we were only staying two nights and the room appeared otherwise okay at that point (I had not yet noticed the peeling paint on the bottom edge of the bathroom door) we elected to stay put. I think fatigue from a long drive from Albany NY played a big part in that decision. (4) The breakfast buffet was so-so compared to many hotels where we have stayed.  It was not awful but I think a place that is entitled to charge up to $799.00 per night (yes. that is the top rate for the room we booked although we did not pay anywhere near that) could offer an omelet station for eggs made to order and a regular breakfast menu (even if it is extra) for those who dislike buffets (I am one of those since food tends to get soggy etc. from sitting in steam trays too long).,1. Location is excellent.  Place is clean and attractive.  Staff are helpful.
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Harbor on Tudor Wharf,Mary,United States of America,7 Reviews,September 8  2016,9.6,The free wifi was very poor and even interferred with my cell phone usage.

Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Harbor on Tudor Wharf,Lily,United States of America,2 Reviews,September 7  2016,7.5,Bed could have been bigger. with a firmer mattress.,The location was fantastic! We walked to the aquarium. then took the subway to Tufts and back to the hotel.  It was a quick 10 minute drive to the airport.  I prefer a firmer bed. which was also a bit small (queen would be better than a full).  But overall it was a great stay and we would definitely stay there again!
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Harbor on Tudor Wharf,Amanda,Canada,2 Reviews,September 5  2016,8.3,The person at the front desk seemed a bit confused about the room type we reserved. On our reservation confirmation. the photo illustrated a queen suite (separate bedroom). She put us in a studio. I went back to ask her if we could switch to the correct room. and she told me that the Queen suite was a studio. In any event. she upgraded us to a suite (with a king bed). so it ended well.,The beds were comfy; water pressure was only second to Niagara Falls; free breakfast was always a bonus. as was the nice swimming pool. Very family friendly and the location is perfect (quiet but close to many landmarks).

I get that accidents happen and the valet involved and the fri eve staff were apologetic and sweet.. Sun staff told me it's not the hotel's responsibility and gave me a full blll. We were so disgusted at that point we didn't even go to the last day of our convention we just went home,Pet friendly
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Harbor on Tudor Wharf,Jennifer,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 12  2016,8.8,I thought that the dishwasher was great. but since we were only there a few days. and we only used a few dishes. it would have been nice to have a little bottle of dish washing liquid. I felt so bad leaving dishes in the sink or the dishwasher for the maid to do.Also would have been nice to have air fresheners in the room.The Biggest Downer. and I heard it from other guests as well was the key card access in the elevators. Don't get me wrong. it is a great security feature. but it took some "fiddling" and "key wiggling" to get the light to go red and hopefully read the card green. When it works properly. it is a wonderful feature.,The check in process was so easy. the staff was very friendly and the breakfast was very good.

Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Harbor on Tudor Wharf,Anonymous,United States of America,2 Reviews,March 16  2016,10,There weren't enough extra blankets and sheets in the closet when our grandson came to stay with us.Our room faced the highway. Garbage truck came early Saturday morning!,There was a mix-up in the booking. and the front desk took care of it right away. The valet parking gentleman was super! Knew which car was ours without our having to tell him.Breakfasts were great and a wonderful addition. Nobody had to rush off someplace else for breakfast.
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Harbor on Tudor Wharf,Kudosfromcanada,Canada,2 Reviews,March 15  2016,10,The ONLY small con that comes to mind is regarding pillows.  Both my husband and I found them a little flat for our preference and had a bit of a stiff neck from them. Given the overall positive experience this was a very minor and totally manageable detail.,The entire staff were PHENOMENAL!!  From those at the front desk (especially Lisa!!!).  to those who were manning the breakfast area and its supplies and the gentleman that restocked the pool towels.  An amazing hotel and an overwhelmingly positive experience.  Can't gush enough about it! :)Incredible breakfast.  Rooms were a great size. very comfortable.  Pool was very clean and our kids loved how warm it was. Great location for getting to TD Garden. Science Centre and the Aquarium.
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Harbor on Tudor Wharf,Celticfan86,United States of America,1 review,March 13  2016,8.8,The parking is awful! There is no parking lot for the hotel. they have a valet to park your car in the hotel garage but they charge $45 a night (not included with room rate) their was no mention of this when booking the room. And no where to park while you wait for the valet.,The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Very clean. beautiful atmosphere. Beautiful views of the city. close to everything.
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Harbor on Tudor Wharf,Christine,United States of America,1 review,March 11  2016,9.6,Due to the concert playing around the corner the price on the 2 rooms cost me almost$900! OUCH! I come from northern Maine and there just isnt that much money in the area. But having gone to college I clearly understand the supply and demand. and they are certainly one among many hotels charging more money due to the concert. It's the power of economics working the way that it does. Such is life and no fault of this hotel. :0),I loved this hotel!! Rooms are spacious and clean . Beds are super comfy! For being in the heart of the city it is remarkably quiet. Staff is excellent! Helpful. friendly. all doing a super great job!! Definitely would stay again!!! :0)
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Harbor on Tudor Wharf,Allison,United States of America,2 Reviews,February 23  2016,3.3,They charge $50 to park car overnight and do not advise customer of this! It's. Sort only. There is a sign out front w list of prices for parking and when I asked parking attendant if additional fees would be charged I was told no. I even asked the front desk about parking and they said valet only with no mention of additional fees. Only discovered it on my anj statement. When I called to question charge the hotel could have cared less!,N/A
Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Harbor on Tudor Wharf,Allison,United States of America,2 Reviews,February 23  2016,4.6,I was NOT told by booking.com or the staff when I checked in they offer valet PARKING only and charge an ADDITIONAL $50.00. I was not aware of this charge until I read my bank statement.  When I called I was told there was nothing they could do. I could have booked somewhere else for much cheaper with the price I ended up paying for this place!,N/A

Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Harbor on Tudor Wharf,Claudine,United States of America,3 Reviews,December 31  2015,7.1,The breakfast lounge resembled a zoo: there were so many people that you had to wait in a line without knowing what you might get at the end of the line. Not enough seating places also. In fact I ended up with some fruit and yogurt. I could reach the coffee place only when I was leaving and had to take it in my room.This is a shame for a hotel that pretends to be upscale.,location close to many historical sites

Residence Inn by Marriott Boston Harbor on Tudor Wharf,Diane,United States of America,14 Reviews,December 9  2015,9.2,We upgraded to a room with a view of Boston Harbor.  Even at night the harbor is lovely. However. we were put in a room on a floor (2nd I think) that had bright. and I mean BRIGHT. spotlight-like landscape lights that shined into the room making it impossible to see out. We actually could have been smack dab downtown. so bright was it.  We had to shut the black-out curtains to sleep (we don't like to use the curtains. especially when we have an early morning as we tend to sleep too long) which defeated the purpose of upgrading to the harbor view.,Location is wonderful.  Staff very nice. Possibly best breakfast at a chain hotel that we've ever had.

Uber took us on short. inexpensive rides to wherever we needed to go.I thought the staff was quite nice.

16 E. Springfield Street by Short Term Rentals Boston,Henry,Canada,4 Reviews,July 23  2017,7.5,Poor maintenance of the property. We called maintenance twice during our stay for A/C service and bathroom sink pipe leakage. Parking is difficult. We requested parking in advance but never got response from anyone. The weblink provided for parking request does not work. Communication is extremely confusing to which party to talk to. Maintenance request to call directly to property management. Not sure what the role of booking.com why everything needs to go to them.  Request for additional person to stay was received too late several weeks after and several days just before we arrived. No 24 hrs customer service to report or talk something outside normal business hour. Late arrival is on your own.,Amenities of the property that include washer and dryer.

Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Laura,Switzerland,26 Reviews,August 11  2017,8.3,The breakfast is just okay. but there is a starbucks on the property.  The hotel feels very big and crowded so it is a good place for business or if you do not plan on staying much at the hotel. but it does not have a romantic or quaint feeling to it.  We just love the location the best.,The location is fantastic and right next to the Aquarium. 2 good restaurants. and all the boating activities at the harbor.   The beds are comfortable too.
Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Laurence,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,August 4  2017,7.5,Not that plush. tea and coffee in room was in short supply. Quite expensive. especially when three taxes are added to the original quote. A bit impersonal.,Brilliant location. nice hotel. large room. comfortable.

Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Mary,United States of America,1 review,July 25  2017,5.0,Horrible customer service. We booked a water front room. When we arrived we were told there were no water front rooms available. They blamed it on the fact that we booked through Booking.com. Said they can't guarantee anything booked through that site. They put us in a room with one king bed and a pullout couch for 3 people. There were no blankets and pillows for the pullout. The telephones (2 of them) in the room were not working. so I had to go downstairs to request linens. 45 minutes later. still no linens. Went down again. Apology. said there is only one housekeeper on duty. I asked if one needed to be a trained housekeeper to bring up blankets and pillows. Finally they arrived at 10 pm. One of the pillow cases had strange fuzz all over it. Again. had to ask for replacement. Approximately 6" inches between end of pullout and side of king bed. My mother could hardly squeeze through. Next day. changed our room to partial water view. Better. Slightly bigger. Again. no pillows or blankets. They knew we were going to use the pullout. I explained all of the issues with the non-water view room and the service. Asked for compensation. They gave us vouchers for free breakfast (for 3 people). I thought that was inadequate for our experience. I also asked if they could discount our rate for the first night. since we paid extra for water view. Said they could not do that because they offered us a water view room with 2 double beds. This is ridiculous since 2 double beds would not accommodate our party (my 2 80 year old parents and myself).,The breakfast was good and the server was very pleasant and professional. The third floor balcony overlooking the water was nice.

Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Nancy,United States of America,1 review,July 19  2017,8.3,First day checking in. pool was closed for the day. When I booked room.

The air conditioning was broken for 2 nights and we were never given a different room. BAD SERVICE!,We have stayed here many time before. Love the location. People are friendly &amp; always helpful.   We will come back!
Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Marilyn,United States of America,1 review,July 12  2017,10,I have no complaints about the hotel.  However. City View Trolley is a ripoff!  They advertised on their kiosk at $22 for all day. hop on. hop off with a free harbor cruise.  The fast talking sales person charged me $30 for a one time only ride. NO harbor cruise.  What a ripoff.  I know you don't have any control over this. but every one of their kiosks advertises these phony rates.,The beds were very comfortable. and I loved the shower. and all the luxury bath products.  The view was really nice. too.  Did quite a lot of walking all over the city. so didn't need the gym.  I didn't bring my bathing suit. but the pool looked great!!  The lobby is comfortable and yet private enough to send emails with the free wifi.
Boston Marriott Long Wharf,William,United States of America,1 review,June 19  2017,8.8,We were there to watch the Tall Ships &amp; had a great view from the terrace however you had to leave the terrace to go to restroom &amp; risk not being able to return.There is a door from terrace to restroom that they locked &amp; once I got to the restroom it was not attended to properly.The reason you may not be able to return is only 100 people were allowed on terrace. you leave others come in.,Very good breakfast buffett.The pillows &amp; bed were great.The patio overlooking is fantastic!

Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Anonymous,United States of America,4 Reviews,April 20  2017,8.3,When we booked we saw there was a hot tub. When we arrived we were told that the tub was being removed. Because we were there for the marathon this was a disappointment. We also notice a few things in the room that could have been cleaned better. Example: there was a hand print. in what looked like jelly. on the back side of the bathroom door. The rest of the room seemed very clean.,Location was terrific. Access to the Wharf. Aquarium. most tour group starts. and Quincey Market was wonderful. There is a T line exit right in front of the hotel. Great food close by.

Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Darnell,United States of America,1 review,February 5  2017,4.6,N/A,We were never told upon booking that pool was down and when calling to confirm reservation the morning of.. I specifically asked about the pool use for the children and never told that pool had been down for over a month. The breakfast buffet was overpriced at 25$ for adults and food was cold. Although they comped a movie and parking we were not offered an up grade room or a discounted rate. I think when you are paying 200 for a place to sleep the beds should also be more comfortable. The only thing that made this hotel enjoyable was the fun that the kids had riding the escalator. The parking staff was very pleasant and the proximity to aquarium was good. They need to make customers aware that the pool is unavailable prior to booking a reservation.

Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Georgann,United States of America,2 Reviews,November 14  2016,9.6,The concierge floor lounge was overrun by children on my last night. They obviously were not staying on that floor as I observed them getting on the elevator to go to their rooms. It sounded later like they were bouncing on my head in the room upstairs. They also were running and making a lot of noise in the hallway. Although supervised by an adult. I had to tell them to quiet down.,The concierge staff was unbelievably helpful. They helped me map out my four day stay with events that I particularly wanted to attend. and even how to get there and back!I appreciated the concierge lounge. It was a bit pricey. but I found the breakfast to  have a lot of choices. and it was relaxing to enjoy the view and a glass of wine at the end of the day.

Waterline restaurant has only a few table with a view since the Bar was built blocking the view.  Room are a bit dated.,N/A
Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Darla,United States of America,1 review,September 3  2016,9.6,No free wi-fi and the cost of parking but that is probably normal for Boston- just a bit much to swallow from a rochestarian.,Free Wi-fi would be wonderful considering the cost of a nights stay. The location could not be beat. Would stay here again.
Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Peter,United States of America,1 review,August 27  2016,9.4,We asked for an extra blanket the first night it never showed up. The next night we asked for extra coffee cups they also never came.,Location. view. comfortable beds
Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Diane,United States of America,3 Reviews,August 16  2016,7.1,Fees for Internet and parking.  Provide coffee. tea in morning.   Check out pineapple group in northwest for comparison.  It's a better deal!,This is a great location.  accessibility to restaurants. shopping and transportation.
Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Anita,United States of America,1 review,July 27  2016,9.2,My mattress was a little soft!,The location was great. the staff were extremely helpful and responsive. the restaurant was great. the facility was clean and safe.
Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Anonymous,United States of America,4 Reviews,July 26  2016,8.8,Third-party booking had us in a room with no window the first night. Hotel had been overbooked. Offer to send us across town to another property was unsatisfactory. Upgrade the second night at a discount was a great effort by staff after hours of waiting,Location
Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Donna,United States of America,1 review,July 21  2016,10,Having to pay for Wi-Fi in your room. The price of the room was expensive enough and it should be included.,Very comfortable room. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Loved the restaurants in the area.
Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Leslie,United States of America,1 review,July 14  2016,7.9,Very expensive hotel. But I guess that is what things cost on the east coast. But still. $499 for the second night when the first was $289. It was the SAME room!,Convenience to everything.
Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Ian,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,July 8  2016,6.7,No free wi-fi in the rooms and the free wi-fi in the lobby was poor.Swimming pool turned out to be relly small.Windows didn't open. so you could not switch off the air-con. (which was not really needed).,Location was great.
Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Susan,United States of America,1 review,July 7  2016,8.8,It's honestly so pricey. But so is everything in the town which is honestly a bit disappointing if you're trying to budget at the same time. i don't recommend going to the breakfast buffet with a large group because it's around $35 for each person. The convenience store isn't much better. I attempted to buy ice cream but pints are $8. the 7-Eleven around the block is $6 for a pint. I reccommend getting the breakfast plan on this website bc it is $20 for all people ;D you just let them know you had the plan before checking out and the entire breakfast bill is taken off. Also. There is a parking garage across the street for $36 for 24 Hours. But be aware. few minutes over 24 hours and you'll end up paying $72!,The security is fantastic. To access certain parts you require a room key to do so (Pool/Fitness Room. entering from deck. and hotel rooms while using the elevator) There is also plenty of guards roaming and making sure there is no suspicious activity. The staff was overall nice but some seemed uninformed about all the details of the hotel. It's at great location with an amazing deck for looking out to sea. The Quincy Market is located nearby and if you want to go to the new England Aquarium. it's just a few steps away! The facilities are quite nice and clean. The lobby is full of seats for lounging about and there's free wifi if you don't want to pay $13 for low streaming in your room ($15 for high quality streaming). My daughter and her friends especially enjoyed the indoor  swimming pool and sitting in the hot tub. But. if they are 15 or under. they ask that you supervise them. so I sat on the deck reading my magazines. I had a wonderful time!
Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,June 21  2016,9.2,Our room was small.  Only two twin beds in a room for 3 adults. and a bathroom fit for 1 person.,Location was awesome and staff friendly.  We'd stay there again.

Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Former,United States of America,5 Reviews,May 31  2016,8.3,Room view was of the top of a wall.. could barely even see Christopher Columbus Park from our window.

Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Renée,Switzerland,7 Reviews,April 22  2016,5.4,For the price of $649 per night I think that internet and a complementary bottle of water should have been included.

The room was disappointing - I will not be staying there again.,N/A
Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Dan,United States of America,1 review,April 19  2016,6.3,Everything was extremely overpriced. Get more bang for your buck at a comfort inn.

Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Paulette,United States of America,1 review,March 29  2016,6.3,We stayed here last year and were very happy. This year however we had an inside room although we booked well in advance. Very expensive.,The men outside and the valets were great!

Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Phil,United States of America,1 review,January 21  2016,8.3,Wasn't the type of room I requested.  Pricey.  had to seek out valet when I arrived at the door.  Gave u the look of "well. where's my tip."  Pu locally would ask each other "what did u just get.",Very clean.  Room itself was nice.  Breakfast was great.

Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Virginia,United States of America,1 review,January 3  2016,4.6,There was an overwhelming chlorine smell in the room. It burned my eyes and I felt sick most of the night.

Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Amy,United States of America,6 Reviews,December 27  2015,9.2,Service in the restaurant was a bit slow,The location was great for us. as we have family in the North End.

Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Elaine,United States of America,8 Reviews,November 24  2015,9.6,We asked to be near the pool; we were at the opposite end of the building. We wanted to be near our grandchildren; we were 3 floors apart. therefore no grandchildren staying over with us-too far to bring back to their parents. Also we were assigned an inner room-no daylight- frosted glass window made room seem even smaller than it was! Bathroom was handicapped accessible. fine if needed. but I could not use shower head for a shampoo. Very disappointed with room; location excellent. but will think twice about another visit. Room assignment just not what I'd expect or thought I'd be getting when booked. Who would think to ask are you placing me in a handicapped room and I won't be able to shampoo over the weekend?,Staffing was excellent: doorman remembered our grandkids names. made suggestions. Bellhops were wonderful! Waiter awesome. very understanding of 4 kids ages 2-7. Breakfast buffet pleased everyone. Only disappointment was room assignment; limited access to grandchildren.
Boston Marriott Long Wharf,Jose,Switzerland,4 Reviews,November 19  2015,7.5,Cleaning of rooms performed very late during the day. E.g. I had to call for the room to be cleaned at 15:30. Explanation: I (the client) must understand that there are more than 400 rooms in the hotel and so they can't be cleaned early.,Location. comfort of the rooms

652 Massachusetts Avenue by Short Term Rentals Boston,Sean,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,November 2  2017,7.9,Not having lived in a city for many years it took us a day or two to get used to the level of traffic noise (starting very early. with many large trucks stopping right outside (the apartment is close to the intersection) and also the building front door is right next to the flat. It has to be said that by the 2nd morning it was better and by the 3rd we hardly noticed the noise. We would recommend some kind of privacy protection for the windows too. because if you open the curtains. the afore-mentioned truck drivers and others can look directly into the bedroom which is only about 30ft away.,Apartment was small but very clean and well equipped. Bed was large and comfortable. Good shower. The location is great with a bus stop across the road that goes straight into the city in about 10-15 minutes. It is also a nice walk into the city - Newbury St area in about 25-30 minutes. Awesome coffee shop. some great restaurants and bars are within a few blocks.
652 Massachusetts Avenue by Short Term Rentals Boston,Audrey,United Kingdom,5 Reviews,October 17  2017,5.4,Conflicting information given on how to access building.  Didn’t.t like being next to the hospital. in a front room on the main road. being woken up by ambulance sirens. Did not like all the extra costs which made the costs soar. The bill for cleaning was over 100 dollars for a 2 night stay! Parking our car was a nightmare.,N/A
652 Massachusetts Avenue by Short Term Rentals Boston,Erik,United States of America,1 review,June 6  2017,8.3,Unit 2 where I stayed is on the first floor of the building facing Massachusetts Ave. It has a lot of traffic. so if you're at all a light sleeper you'll be awake early. Bring ear plugs. The location could be a bit daunting for non-city folk. It is a neighborhood in transition. so while there are several new restaurants opening or that have recently opened nearby. there are also some homeless folks / panhandlers around. I did not personally feel unsafe at all. but if you get at all squirrelly in urban environments. this might not be for you.,The place had everything I needed in it. and the bed was very comfortable. There's a 7-Eleven and a Dunkin' Donuts a block away. I used the #1 bus right out front to get to the convention center. or just walked the approx. 1 mile. If you're heading in to do touristy things. there are 2 T stations. Massachusetts Ave. ( Orange line ) and Symphony ( Green E line ) pretty close by. Also. if you happen to be visiting Boston University. the BU Shuttle runs from the Medical Campus just down the street over to the main campus frequently.
652 Massachusetts Avenue by Short Term Rentals Boston,Rodrigo,Portugal,10 Reviews,April 25  2017,4.6,It felt like we were sleeping in the middle of the street. very very noisy in a busy avenue next to a hospital with very early traffic and noisy ambulances. We hated  because we could not rest! The apartment was very small for the price too and the photos were not from this apartment but from the whole building. Also be careful with hidden costs.,Well decorated and modern.
652 Massachusetts Avenue by Short Term Rentals Boston,Melanie,United States of America,1 review,August 9  2016,7.1,We were only given one towel and washcloth each for 2.5 days. We were told that we would have a washer and dryer in unit and the washer actually didn't work. I contacted maintenance although they responded through email with some ideas we were unable to get it rectified. I would think that since it wasn't working they would have asked if we needed anything. It was extremely hot and we showered a couple of times per day. I would think that there would have been an abundant amount of towels and washcloths available. Also when I stripped the bed the mattress cover was stained with what looked like urine. That is why I took it completely off the mattress so that house keeping could take it for laundry.  That was a bit off putting. The mattress itself although older and not very comfortable. was impeccable. All in all we managed and kept rinsing our wash clothes but I do truly wish things were a little different regarding comfort level. The area wasn't that great. But we didn't do any research. We are well aware of city life but it seems as though on Massachusetts avenue itself there were many drug addicted homeless individuals nodding out wherever they could find a place to rest. When we would "sit on the stoop" MANY passers by asked us for things as they walked by. We did not encounter anything scary or rudeness though. We are a friendly laid back couple late 30's.,I loved the space! From the outside looking in it was very clean and inviting. Everything looked new. was nicely decorated and extremely inviting. We loved it! It was a fun experience for my fiancé and I rather than renting a hotel room.

One-Bedroom on Beacon Street Apt 205,Colleen,United States of America,1 review,April 24  2017,9.5,The exhaust fan in the bathroom didn't work. We would have preferred a bit softer mattress.In the bathroom. it would be nice to have a couple of hooks to hang shave kits / cosmetic bags  and a hook near the sink for the handtowel.,The apartment was very clean.  The kitchen had everything we needed and we appreciated all the extra towels.  It was very nice to not have to deal with a "hotel" environment. we felt like we were living in Boston.  The apartment is very close to the T so getting around the city was easy.  There are several good little restaurants nearby as well as a Whole Foods to pick up food when we wanted to cook in the apartment.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Anonymous,United Kingdom,1 review,October 14  2017,4.2,No chairs in seating area in room for relaxing. (the booking said we would have some).

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Alan,Canada,9 Reviews,October 12  2017,6.3,The hotel is rather drab; when we arrived we didn't know we wanted to stay there but the front desk staff made us feel welcome and immediately allocated our room at 10:00 AM.The hotel is located in a rough end of Boston; we did not appreciate the street noise that lasted into the early hours of each day we stayed there.,Clean. comfortable hotel.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Ernest,United States of America,1 review,September 21  2017,7.1,I had made reservations 2 months prior to arrival for a 2 Bed room.  I was disappointed when I got there to find that I could only get a room with one bed and a couch that made into a bed.   The room with the couch was so small that  when the couch was made into a bed.  here was very little room to walk around in.  After two days they found a room available with two beds and offered to move us.  Since we spent most of our time out of the room.  we declined to move.,Location was great (very convenient to subway).  Staff was friendly.

Underpadding of corridor carpeting quite lumpy so be careful if you have mobility challenges.   In terms of value. due to a/c issues. we received a different rate which made the value much better. but would have to say regular rate is high.,Kaitlin at front desk was amazing.   Valet and property management services also excellent - very responsive.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Craig,Canada,4 Reviews,July 17  2017,8.3,Finding the entrance to the hotel was not easy. It is in an old building that goes along Friend St . which is a one way street. The front door is just like any other door entrance to a shop or bar along this street. with only a very small Holiday Inn sign above the door.,Located directly across the street from TD Garden. The T Line is right around the corner.Haymarket and Faneuil Hall are just a short walk.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Alan,United Kingdom,13 Reviews,May 29  2017,8.3,We booked a suite for four of us. The bed on the settee was not at all comfortable.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Carolyn,Australia,5 Reviews,April 28  2017,3.3,The room was not at all what we were expecting from a Holiday Inn.

Our granddaughter was bitten by what we think were bed bugs and was bitten all over her torso. I would not go back to our room until I abbsolutely had to. For $400.00 Aus it was terrible.,The staff were quite friendly.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Internet,United States of America,5 Reviews,April 11  2017,4.2,The bathroom looked like it had black mold growing in the grout and on the ceiling.  The room did not have a fridge which was disappointing because the information on the internet led me to believe it had one.  The noise from outside was horrible. the windows are not insulated well and the interior was old.  We did notice that they are remodeling. but we were not in one of the "new" rooms. Lots of bars in the immediate area- not where a family should stay.,The staff was pleasant and helpful.

Needless to say there were four of us and one of us slept on the floor.  The next morning when it came time to get our car from valet parking. they misplaced our keys we waited at least another half hour from when they told us it would be ready.   The whole stay there was a nightmare from the minute we stepped foot in the hotel.  Also. they had 2 elevators only one worked.  climbed 5 flights of stairs each time we went out.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Arnaud,United States of America,3 Reviews,February 20  2017,5.8,The hotel is next to several noisy bars. avoid rooms on street side. especially during weekends.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Connie,Canada,1 review,November 6  2016,8.8,The hotel could have clearer signage. It was a little hard to find.,The staff were very friendly and helpful.  Nice to come back to the hotel and there was cold water available and hot water for tea. Our room was very comfortable for 5 people. Breakfast was very good with a good selection.  Location was great. Walking distance to most tourist attractions and very close to T station and north station.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Arlene,United States of America,1 review,November 1  2016,7.5,The above says it all!,First night there was so much screaming and yelling outside after the bars let out that we didn't sleep until after 4. There was also a group of people breaking into a car below us. The street noise was SO loud all night with ambulances. fire trucks and police cars.We were moved at my request to a totally quiet for our  2 nights.Staff was excellent at helping to resolve our issues.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Anonymous,United States of America,3 Reviews,October 21  2016,7.5,Soap in the kitchen would have been nice.  Although our room was clean. there was a bit of a funky smell in the hallway.  Slow &amp; spotty wifi.,Ashley. at the front desk. was especially charming.  Very glad we had a room with tile flooring; the carpeted areas need replacing!
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Anonymous,Australia,6 Reviews,October 14  2016,5.8,I was not advised of the TOTAL of the stay from Booking.com which other websites provide. I was of the belief that $438 was for 3 nights. not 1 night. There was ONLY valet parking at $43 per day. there was no other choice. This should have been highlighted in the offers of hotels as it made my stay MUCH more expensive than budgeted.,The bed and soft pillows.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Marylynn,United States of America,1 review,October 13  2016,5.0,We couldn't find the place after more than a hour of driving.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Raymond,China,1 review,September 5  2016,5.0,When I checked in. the receptionist gave me a room with only one bed. I turned back to them and said I've booked a standard room with two beds. One of them talked me they called it as "standard room" and instructed me that I could use a "pull-out pouch". Only after I protested that I would only have been sleeping on a sofa for four nights while still paying for 2 beds. they started to search a standard room for me. They at last gave me a standard room with 2 beds however I still had to wait for another 1.5 hours as they claimed the room clearing was still ongoing. The check-in experience was not satisfactory.,The room is clean.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Elisa,United States of America,1 review,August 27  2016,7.9,Had a suite that can sleep 4.  We were two adults and one teen.  Almost no counter space in bathroom. only mirror in bathroom. Furniture in living room area was chipped. hallways were dingy.  Parking was ridiculously expensive. 43.00 a day when we were already paying over 280.00 a night for the room and the garage is 2 blocks away so you have to give at least 15 minutes notice to attendant when you want your car.  Tons of street construction going on. at one point hotel street was closed.  Located in West end near TD garden. must use transportation to get to most sightseeing attractions,staff was excellent. very friendly. helpful and attentive.  Breakfast was included and a fantastic value.  Nice kitchenette in the room.  Very clean.  Very convenient to have tour trolley stop across the street.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Heather,United States of America,1 review,May 16  2016,9.6,Our room was kind of a weird layout with the closet in the center of everything but that was really not a big deal. Having the kitchenette was great!!! Room could have used more lighting.  It seemed very dim and the small windows made it feel like we were in the basement.,Having the free breakfast was one of the reasons I booked with this hotel.  Other bonus that made it even better was the close proximity to the train station.  I ran the Boston Marathon and I really appreciated the enthusiasm from the staff and the Marathon themed snack basket in the room.  After the race. they provided water and snacks too. That was really nice!! Compared to other hotels. I felt like this was a great value.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Simon,United Kingdom,2 Reviews,May 15  2016,4.2,The majority of the stay!1) checked in. they gave us the wrong room. Complained. they wouldn't change it for us.'the front desk staff wernt very helpful. 2) For some unknown reason the hotel floor we stayed on (2) and the stairwell absolutely stunk. God knows what the smell was but it was disgusting.3) The award for the slowest lift on earth goes to...4) Our rooms plug sockets were loose and exposed wires. 5) Room A/C was rubbish. the lowest it went was 15 deg C but it didn't go that low. and after a while it didn't blow out cold at all so the room became unbearably hot.6) Lastly. we were put on the second floor. at the front by the street. I didn't think this was a problem until at 2am it was kicking out time for the streets bars. So so loud. unable to sleep and combine this with a boiling hot room had a terrible nights sleep. All of this for $250+ per night is terrible.,There is little good to tell. The location is decent to then city centre however right next to student bars gets loud.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Lisa,United States of America,4 Reviews,April 19  2016,9.2,Waiting for the elevator was probably the worst. the good things this hotel has to offer is way more then just having to wait for elevator.,All staff went above and beyond to ensure our stay was first class. The man who was in charge of the continental breakfast was first class. The location was excellent.

At the end of our stay out bill was $495 we were over chgd $545 and are still waiting for  the $50 over chgs pending fees to be released.,Hot breakfast and close to Quincy market.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Jennifer,United States of America,1 review,March 27  2016,9.6,Not that we really didn't like it but we didn't really know ahead of time why there was a need for valet parking. Once we got there and saw that the hotel was mixed in which a bunch of other buildings we understood.,Great service and our room was nice.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Tessa,United States of America,1 review,March 15  2016,7.1,The fact that you have to pay $35 for parking that's a 15 min walk from the hotel. The bacon was horrible at breakfast. didn't even taste like bacon. Our room was very small. it was very dark. only one very small window that faced the middle of the building and the compressors for the A/C for the hotel with garbage outside the window.,We were in town from NY to see a bruins game and the location couldn't have been more perfect.
Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Terry,United States of America,4 Reviews,March 10  2016,8.8,The neighborhood is a little more than sketchy.

Especially after 11PM.,The staff.all staff members are awesome. 1st off. if you're going to the TD Center.you couldn't be any closer. Big Plus!! 2nd.the room was large enough.very clean and the bed was comfortable. Bathroom was super clean and zero issues. I would definitely stay there again.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Boston TD Garden,Chris,United States of America,1 review,December 4  2015,7.5,It just so happened I had to have 2 cars there. The price to keep one car. let alone 2 is insane! $40 per car per day. I was there 3 days. So $80 a day! That's $248 total. That's on top of spending $1000 for my room for my 3 night stay. I would think a discount on the car(s)would be something they could think about if your stay is longer then 1 or 2 nights.,The room was nice and spacious and the location was great!!

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there and will want to stay there again when we go back to Boston for a visit.
Moroccan Luxury Suites,Gary,United States of America,1 review,October 17  2017,10,N/A,The room itself was an experience in Middle Eastern culture and art.  There was plentiful information about the lovely art pieces and historical and cultural heritage of these pieces.  The proprietors are friendly and provided a warm welcoming tour of the premises.   The room itself was profoundly interesting.
Moroccan Luxury Suites,Mrs,United Kingdom,6 Reviews,October 13  2017,10,N/A,We had a marvellous 4-night stay at the Moroccan Suites.  Our rooms were tastefully furnished and the balcony terrace was a bonus.  All the facilities were excellent. including a well-stocked fridge and a coffee machine as well as a kettle.   The neighbourhood was very convenient. 10 minutes' walk to the T (Community College).  The pubs and restaurants nearby were so good we didn't need to return to the City to eat in the evening.  Bill and Elizabeth were attentive hosts.  Highly recommended!
Moroccan Luxury Suites,Linda,United Kingdom,8 Reviews,June 19  2017,9.2,Nothing.  The only thing to be aware of is if you have mobility issues or heavy suitcases. it may be tricky to navigate the relatively steep staircase.  But there is enough to look at on the way up that it takes your mind off of it and enough landings to rest.  The owner took my suitcase up. but it was HEAVY and I'd wished I'd packed lighter. for her sake.,Beautiful unique rooms. delicious food in the kitchen.  the owner is very kind and helpful. the cleaners keep everything tidy and so clean.  I loved this place and only wish I'd had my husband with me (but not my daughter!) and that I had more opportunity to spend time there.
Moroccan Luxury Suites,Robynn,United States of America,1 review,June 17  2017,10,Everything was great.,This is hands down the best B &amp; B I have ever stayed in. The room is gorgeous. fully stocked w healthy treats. The staff is is wonderful. I will never stay anywhere else in Boston.
Moroccan Luxury Suites,Nicholaus,United States of America,6 Reviews,May 23  2017,9.6,One wall plug did not work. Little closet space was offered in the room that we booked (which. admittedly. was the smallest on the property as all the others were taken.),The interior designer has created a space that transports one to an alternate land. It was both comfy and luxurious. romantic and quaint. This hotel is a must stay!

Moroccan Luxury Suites,Ranger,Belgium,14 Reviews,April 24  2017,10,Rarely have my wife and I had such a perfect stay...sincerely there is nothing we did not like!,From the moment of arrival we felt like being "at home"...the free Wifi was an unexpected plus.  The proprietor is a superb hostess and has taken special pride to ensue each room contains a unique flare that reflects authentic Morocco; she accommodated our curiousity to have a look at each room.  When taken to our truly luxurious Moroccan suite. we felt transported to a corner of paradise on earth...rarely have we experienced the feeling of such total relaxation. ease and welcome throughout an entire stay.  The Moroccan Luxury Suites is a gem of 18th century history that was positive in every regard...this is now our lodging of choice for return visits to the Boston area.
Moroccan Luxury Suites,Amalendra,United States of America,2 Reviews,April 24  2017,10,N/A,Our stay at Moroccan Luxury Suites was one of our most memorable stays in any hotel - in any country. First of all. this is a unique property located in an historic 18thC home. Each suite is furnished with an exotic theme. using antiques and gorgeous fabrics - while also including a fully-equipped kitchenette. Some suites even have a balcony with a garden. And secondly. the owner (Elizabeth) was wonderful and truly went above and beyond all expectations with her excellent service  ... from rose petals on the bedspread (it was our anniversary) to running out and getting non-dairy creamer for our coffee (who does that!?!) I highly recommend this Inn to anyone looking for something unique and exotic - and not just another 'box' to stay in. Linens were also luxurious and bathroom amenities very good. Truly a memorable stay! As I said. I hardly feel that five stars are enough to do it justice!
Moroccan Luxury Suites,Jimmy,United Kingdom,1 review,December 18  2016,10,N/A,Elizabeth and Bill were so hospitable - they went above and beyond to accommodate to us.

Moroccan Luxury Suites,Anonymous,Canada,2 Reviews,November 15  2016,10,There were no hot breakfast options...eggs. bacon. waffles. etc.  I would also have preferred fresh. uncut fruit as opposed to a store-bought. prepackaged tray.,It was great having the convenience of having a selection of food in the room.  Lactose free and gluten free foods were graciously provided as requested and much appreciated!
Moroccan Luxury Suites,Charles,United States of America,1 review,September 19  2016,10,No free parking.

Nice neighborhood. although parking a problem.  Suite was spacious. bed very comfortable.  Nicely decorated.
Moroccan Luxury Suites,Debora,United States of America,1 review,August 2  2016,10,N/A,Our room was super clean and very comfortable and the in-room kitchenette had all the essentials for a quick morning bite.

Even the owners. who were away for part of our trip. checked in by email to make sure we were doing okay!
Moroccan Luxury Suites,Rebecca,United States of America,1 review,July 21  2016,10,My only wish is that we had stayed longer.,Elizabeth and Bill went out of their way to make sure we were well cared for.

This couple obviously loves this historical home and loves sharing it with guests.
Moroccan Luxury Suites,Erin,United States of America,2 Reviews,June 9  2016,10,The parking situation was a bit difficult (resident only parking during the week) so had to keep the car at a parking garage for $25 per day.

The third floor apartment was decorated nicely and we enjoyed cooking breakfast in our room.

Moroccan Luxury Suites,Jeu,Netherlands,10 Reviews,April 26  2016,7.5,The owner welcomed us on arrival and we did not see her again . At departure her homekeeper was there to day good buy.

Moroccan Luxury Suites,Gary,United States of America,1 review,April 5  2016,10,N/A,Moroccan Luxury Suites is a wonderful place to stay.

Bird's Eye View,Erica,United States of America,1 review,October 28  2017,9.6,Upon departure. there was one male staff member at the front desk that was unprofessional and rude to us. We had been told the previous night that we could keep our baggage with staff during the day before our flight that evening. However. then the next day we were told that "there was not enough room" and he was unkind in his custom service delivery. He told us we would have to leave our luggage out in the open in the lobby all day. This left a bad taste right before we left.,Views were amazing. apartment was very spacious. and everything was clean!!

One-Bedroom on Boylston Street Apt 8,Khaled,United Arab Emirates,3 Reviews,July 1  2017,6.3,They forgot to leave sheets and linens for the sofa bed. they also lift only 4 towels for a family of 4 staying for 6 days! but when i called they were very fast to bringing the sheets and extra towels. the bathroom. and generally the apartment. had some small flies all over. again when i complained they were very quick to bring a liquid repellent. however it didn't work 100%the most important issue i had was the beds. they are very uncomfortable! they need to get better mattresses both on the bed and the sofa bed are very uncomfortable.,the location is beyond GREAT! and the management company managing the property were very fast and attending to my requests.
One-Bedroom on Boylston Street Apt 8,Maryanne,Australia,6 Reviews,April 25  2017,7.5,Booked for 3 people but there wasn't any linen for 3rd person. had to contact host to arrange. Mattress on queen sized bed was sunken on one side. Bathroom was very pokey but manageable.,Convenient location. warm apartment on a cold night.

Apartments on Western Avenue,Paula,New Zealand,5 Reviews,May 3  2017,6.7,After organising early check in the front office person was appaulingly rude and extremely unhelpful.  They certainly let down the customer services I had received through email.  Also the beds were all very uncomfortable and the sofa bed was unsleepable!  I think you need to sort the mattresses out on your beds and stop the squeaks.  Every time you moved the bed squeaked.,The email communication and responses were superb but the front counter staff were appauling.
Apartments on Western Avenue,Thanitnan,Thailand,8 Reviews,September 29  2016,7.5,No service  about wifi . No body help us about parking service.,Cleanliness
Guild Street Townhouse,Kathryn,United States of America,1 review,September 30  2017,9.6,Construction was going on across the street in the mornings. but we were out of the property all day so this didn’t bother us too much.,The hosts were very nice and welcoming and made sure that we were able to access the property easily. We were two couples traveling from Oklahoma to explore Boston and this property was a short ride away from all the places we wanted to go. The rooms were very clean and the TV in the living room was HUGE and very nice for watching games on. The hosts also stored our baggage on the last day until we left for the airport. so we were able to have another day to check out the city without having to worry about our suitcases. We had an overall great time and this place made it very easy as it was affordable and friendly.
Guild Street Townhouse,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 10  2017,4.6,Not the safest location. The neighbors were having a party the first night until 4 a.m. The second night they were quiet but I'm assuming that was from all the pot they smoked that you could smell throughout the unit we stayed in.,There wasn't much to like.
Guild Street Townhouse,Joseph,United States of America,1 review,June 30  2017,10,Nope everything was great (there was construction going on across the street but it started and ended early each day so we weren't bothered by it).,We loved that out kids each had their own beds and that there was plenty of room. that we could bring pets (we often do not get to take overnight trips because bringing a pet isn't allowed). and there was keyless coded entry. We also liked the location and loved that the beds were not overly soft. Everything was labelled nicely and it was sweet to come in on our first day to a special treat left for us. The host was quick to check in and ensure that we had no issues and continued to check in off and on to ensure our trip was pleasant.

Marriott Vacation Club Pulse at Custom House, Boston,New,United States of America,1 review,March 1  2016,5.8,We were given a room immediately next door to an event room. with a very loud party that went till late at night.  For a hotel that boasts of its tower views of the city. nothing could be more disappointing than a dark. first floor room overlooking the street. with booming music coming through the walls.Guests should know that because this is a "residence inn" there is no restaurant. no room service. no access to food unless you bring it in yourselves.,This is a beautiful. historic building with an interesting renovation.  It's in a great location. with easy access from the main roads.
Marriott Vacation Club Pulse at Custom House, Boston,Kelly,United States of America,1 review,February 25  2016,9.2,Very clean and nice room but it was really hot. had to have maintenance come and adjust the heat.  The room is very small. the pictures online looked a lot bigger.  For the price. I expected the room to be larger.  Then. you had to pay for parking at a hotel room that costs $369 per night!!,The location of this hotel is excellent.  Right by Faniel Hall.  Can walk to TD Garden within 5 mins. walk to aquarim.
Marriott Vacation Club Pulse at Custom House, Boston,Sandra,United States of America,1 review,January 18  2016,8.8,Our room was on the first floor and there was a very loud party right outside our door.

Studio on Arch Street Apt 5B,Anonymous,United Kingdom,4 Reviews,July 17  2017,7.1,Pretty noisy at night. As another reviewer has pointed out. the bed sags to one side - this needs fixing,Convenient location. Laundry facilities in the basement. Newly fitted out and well equipped. Promptly sorted out a problem with the shower
Studio on Arch Street Apt 5B,Robert,United States of America,1 review,June 9  2017,8.8,The advertised price is misleading as the per day price of the apartment increases a lot depending on the time of year that it is rented.  Overall. I was happy with the apartment even though I paid a lot more than was advertised on bookings.com.  Bed was adequate. but sagged a little.,Close to the T and walking distance from many historical sites.  Easy to get groceries.  Good response via email with the hosts.  Clean.  Had wifi although the ad said there was no internet.

One-Bedroom on Arch Street Apt 4D,Barbara,United States of America,1 review,March 13  2017,8.8,We had a run-in with a homeless man who set up camp in front of the only entrance we could get to. so we had to call security from another building to make him leave.

Chandler Studios,Anonymous,Israel,1 review,October 16  2017,4.2,The phone number to get in touch to collect the keys is not relevant. There is no answer. You have to go to the Chandler Inn to pick up the keys. There was only one chair on the studio and when we asked for a second one. we were told they don't have any more chairs. The phones in the studios  are not working at all.       go,N/A
Chandler Studios,Alasdair,United Kingdom,7 Reviews,September 4  2017,7.9,Our friends bed broke on the first night and there were other concerns with the general upkeep of the property - toilet doors that did not close fully. for example.,Very high standards of comfort and technological wizardry. Very good security and members of staff who went far beyond the expected. Very central and extremely close to local amenities - shops. dry cleaners (v. good and reasonably priced).
Chandler Studios,Anonymous,United States of America,1 review,August 3  2017,6.7,Room was not very well maintained. Towel rod was falling off wall. Toilet was wobbly and paint was chipping off window sills. Some light bulbs were out in bathroom.,Great location and overall a nice hotel and room.
Chandler Studios,Robin,United States of America,1 review,August 1  2017,7.1,Direct tv was a hassle with very limited options. Coffee pot malfunction. Minor things didn't deter our appreciation for this property. A little high priced for what you get. Think I could've gotten a better deal. but we still enjoyed our stay.,Loved the location for our needs.  Easy keyless entry with windows overlooking Berkekey Street.  Great little coffee/sandwich shop (Billy's Sub Shop) across the street and lots neighborhood restaurants within easy walking distance. Clean. comfortable. Didn't care for direct tv with limited access and coffee pot didn't work. but we weren't there for tv. Overall a great space for us. Would definitely return!

Chandler Studios,Anonymous,United Kingdom,3 Reviews,May 18  2017,8.8,No reception in building where room was.....had to check in further down the same street (was not expecting that) and weather made it more difficult. Had to keep calling reception on successive days to get TV remote control working (battery problem both times) and wifi working (had to be reset every day also. once on the evening of arrival. and every morning). It was sorted in approximately 15 minutes each time. but created problems in early morning as it was a congress trip for me and I needed the connection.,Very clean and modern decor. Comfortable bed. Lovely room and bathroom. Good kitchenette with fridge.
Chandler Studios,Jiaguo Qi,United States of America,1 review,April 9  2017,10,The studios and the office are not in the same building. It would be better if this were emphasized at the time of booking.,digital access to the room; cleanness!
Chandler Studios,John-manuel,United States of America,5 Reviews,January 9  2017,10,Nothing. It was truly perfect. from check in to check out.,Fabulous little efficiency studio in a charming old brownstone on Berkeley Street. a block from Columbus Avenue and extremely conveniently located. As I was there during a snowstorm. the gated. heated parking space right behind the building (at a highly competitive $30/day) was icing on the cake. Highly recommended.
Chandler Studios,Sara,United States of America,6 Reviews,January 2  2017,9.6,Just a bit expensive. but we only splurge a couple times a year. so that's how we justified it.,Comfy. clean. great location! Cute inside. Had everything we needed and more! Will definitely be back!
Chandler Studios,Louise,United Kingdom,12 Reviews,December 11  2016,9.6,Was quite expensive - but I think this is reflective of Boston prices not the studios themselves. Shower could have been more powerful.,I was here for a conference (John hynes centre). Location was about 15 mins walk away - but a very nice walk and felt safe in the evening on my own. For sight seeing everything is also walking distance. My studio was away from the road and very quiet. The apartment was immaculate. Temperature control good. Would definitely stay again. sounded like a much better option than what a lot of my colleagues chose closer to the conference centre.
Chandler Studios,jransom,New Zealand,13 Reviews,October 26  2016,9.2,Nothing - everything was great,This was a fabulous place to stay; spacious. modern. comfortable and close to Back Bay metro stop and good restaurants within 5 mins walk on Tremont St.
Chandler Studios,Erla,Iceland,1 review,October 25  2016,8.8,There was coffee for the machine in the studio on our arrival and I thought there would be coffee every morning. but sadly there was not :-( Since there is a special type of coffee machine I think there should be that special type of coffee every day ;-) You would please your customers even more:-),Comfortable and clean

Near a train station but also easy to walk to the main sights of Boston from there. I requested a studio on the top floor at the back of the building so it was quiet and we were allocated studio 42 which was ideal. The breakfast in the hotel restaurant was delicious and all the staff were very helpful and friendly. Would stay here again.
